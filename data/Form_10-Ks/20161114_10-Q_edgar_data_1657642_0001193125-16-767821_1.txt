      Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies       Organization      Parkway
Acquisition Corp. ( Parkway ) was incorporated as a Virginia corporation on November 2, 2015. Parkway was formed as a business combination shell for the purpose of completing a business combination transaction between Grayson
Bankshares, Inc. ( Grayson ) and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation ( Cardinal ). On November 6, 2015, Grayson, Cardinal and Parkway entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  merger agreement ), providing for
the combination of the three companies. Terms of the merger agreement called for Grayson and Cardinal to merge with and into Parkway, with Parkway as the surviving corporation (the  merger ). The merger agreement established exchange
ratios under which each share of Grayson common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.76 shares of common stock of Parkway, while each share of Cardinal common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.30 shares of common stock of
Parkway. The exchange ratios resulted in Grayson shareholders receiving approximately 60% of the newly issued Parkway shares and Cardinal shareholders receiving approximately 40% of the newly issued Parkway shares. The merger was completed on
July 1, 2016. Grayson is considered the acquiror and Cardinal is considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes.    Upon completion
of the merger, the Bank of Floyd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardinal, was merged with and into Grayson National Bank (the  Bank ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grayson. The Bank was organized under the laws of the United States in 1900
and currently serves Grayson County, Virginia and surrounding areas through seventeen full-service banking offices and one loan production office. As an FDIC-insured National Banking Association, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Comptroller
of the Currency. Parkway is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.    For purposes of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, all
information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2016 reflects the operations of Grayson prior to the merger. Unless this report otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, all references to  Parkway  or
the  Company  as of and for periods subsequent to July 1, 2016 refer to the combined company and its subsidiary as a combined entity after the merger, and all references to the  Company  as of and for periods prior to
July 1, 2016 are references to Grayson and its subsidiary as a combined entity prior to the merger.    The consolidated financial statements as of
September 30, 2016 and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included herein have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of
management, the information furnished in the interim consolidated financial statements reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders 
equity and cash flows for such interim periods. Management believes that all interim period adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial
statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the nine-month and three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.    The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company and the Bank follow generally accepted accounting principles and general practices within the financial services industry.      Principles of
Consolidation      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank, which is wholly owned. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.      Presentation of Cash Flows    
 For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash and amounts due from banks (including cash items in process of collection),
interest-bearing deposits with banks and Federal funds sold.

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued   
   
    Critical Accounting Policies    
 Management believes the policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and asset impairment judgments involve
a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported
results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.  
   Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of
real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. In connection with the determination of the allowances for loan and foreclosed real estate losses, management obtains independent appraisals for significant
properties.    Substantially all of the Bank s loan portfolio consists of loans in its market area. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a
substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of foreclosed real estate are susceptible to changes in local market conditions. The regional economy is diverse, but influenced
by the manufacturing and retirement segments and to an extent by the tourism and agricultural segments.    While management uses available information to
recognize loan and foreclosed real estate losses, future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as a part of their routine examination process, periodically
review the Bank s allowances for loan and foreclosed real estate losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.
Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the allowances for loan and foreclosed real estate losses may change materially in the near term.  
   Risks and Uncertainties      In the normal course of
its business, the Bank encounters two significant types of risks: economic and regulatory. There are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree
that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds, or on different basis, than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Bank s loan portfolio that results from borrowers  inability or
unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by the Bank.  
 The Bank is subject to the regulations of various governmental agencies. These regulations can and do change significantly from period to period. The Bank
also undergoes periodic examinations by the regulatory agencies, which may subject it to further changes with respect to asset valuations, amounts of required loss allowances and operating restrictions from the regulators  judgments based on
information available to them at the time of their examination.

    Income per Share    
 Basic income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, after giving retroactive effect to stock splits and dividends. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares.  
   Comprehensive Income      Comprehensive income
reflects the change in the Bank s equity during the period arising from transactions and events other than investments by and distributions to stockholders. It consists of net income plus certain other changes in assets and liabilities that are
reported as separate components of stockholders  equity rather than as income or expense, primarily unrealized gains and losses or investment securities available for sale. In addition, a separate Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented.
     Reclassifications      Certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior year s financial statements to place them on a comparable basis with the current year. Net income and stockholders  equity previously reported were not affected by these reclassifications.  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of
goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not
expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.    In January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S. GAAP the
concept of an extraordinary item, which is an event or transaction that is both (1) unusual in nature and (2) infrequently occurring. Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer (1) segregate an extraordinary item from the
results of ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an
extraordinary item. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under
U.S. GAAP. Although the amendments are expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities, the Company will need to reevaluate all its previous consolidation conclusions. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016
and did not have a material effect on its financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which provides a practical expedient that permits
the Company to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the Company s fiscal year-end. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on
its financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements, continued    
   
  In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers .  As a result of the deferral, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its
financial statements.    In August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify the SEC
staff s position on presenting and measuring debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. The amendments were effective upon issuance and did not have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 In September 2015, the FASB amended the Business Combinations topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the accounting for adjustments made
to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on
its financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to address certain
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values will be applied
prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify the implementation
guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.    In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification
on the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities allowing them apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or
service conditions that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value. The amendments will be effective for
the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify guidance related to
identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to
have a material effect on its financial statements.

  In May 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the Accounting Standards
Codification to clarify guidance related to collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 .  The
Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.    In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the
accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.    In August 2016, the FASB amended the
Statement of Cash Flows topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.     Note 2. Business Combinations   
 On July 1, 2016, Parkway completed its merger with Grayson and Cardinal. Parkway had no material assets or liabilities and did not conduct any business
prior to consummation of the merger except to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. As such, Grayson is considered the acquiring entity in this business combination for accounting purposes. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each
share of Cardinal common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.30 shares of common stock of Parkway. There was no trading market and no market price for Parkway common stock on the date of the transaction. Parkway was quoted on the OTC
Markets and began trading on August 31, 2016; however, Parkway is a new company and the stock is thinly traded. Grayson, as the accounting acquirer at the time of the merger, was also thinly traded and the limited number of shares traded prior
to the acquisition were not considered indicative of trading value. Due to the limited trading history of Parkway and Grayson, the Company engaged a third party to determine the value of the transaction as well as the value of the consideration paid
to Cardinal as a result of the transaction. The Company also engaged a third party to calculate fair values of all assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. These valuations are not final and may be refined for up to one year following the
merger date.

  The merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities of
Cardinal have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of Grayson for periods following the merger date. Valuations of acquired Cardinal assets and liabilities may be refined for up to one year following the merger date.  
 There are two methods to account for acquired loans as part of a business combination. Acquired loans that contain evidence of credit deterioration on the
date of purchase are carried at the net present value of expected future proceeds in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 310-30. All other acquired loans are recorded at their
initial fair value, adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and any other adjustment to carrying value in accordance with ASC 310-20.  
 The following table presents the assets and liabilities of Parkway and Grayson prior to the merger, the estimated fair value of Cardinal assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, and the resulting estimated balance sheet of Parkway immediately following the merger on July 1, 2016.

   Note 3. Investment Securities   
 Debt and equity securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent. The amortized cost of securities and
their approximate fair values at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 follow:      
   Restricted equity securities were $1.6 million and $972 thousand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. Restricted equity securities consist of investments in stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB), Community Bankers Bank, Pacific Coast Bankers Bank, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, all of which are carried at
cost. All of these entities are upstream correspondents of the Bank. The FHLB requires financial institutions to make equity investments in the FHLB in order to borrow money. The Bank is required to hold that stock so long as it borrows from the
FHLB. The Federal Reserve requires Banks to purchase stock as a condition for membership in the Federal Reserve System. The Bank s stock in Community Bankers Bank and Pacific Coast Bankers Bank is restricted only in the fact that the stock may

   Maturities of mortgage backed securities are based on contractual amounts. Actual maturity will vary as loans underlying the
securities are prepaid.    Investment securities with amortized cost of approximately $9.2 million at September 30, 2016 and $22.3 million at
December 31, 2015, were pledged as collateral on public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

Note 3. Investment Securities, continued   
   
  The following tables details unrealized losses and related fair values in the Company s held to maturity
and available for sale investment securities portfolios. This information is aggregated by the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
     
   At September 30, 2016, debt securities with unrealized losses had depreciated 0.87 percent from their amortized cost
basis. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to
which the fair value has been less than cost, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. The relative significance of these and other factors will vary on a case by case basis. In analyzing an issuer s financial
condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition and the
issuer s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. Since the Company intends to hold all of its investment securities until maturity, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any of
its investment securities before unrealized losses have been recovered, and the Company expects to recover the entire amount of the amortized cost basis of all its securities, none of the securities are deemed other than temporarily impaired at
September 30, 2016. Management continues to monitor all of these securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that the Company will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or
all of these securities are other than temporarily impaired, which could require a charge to earnings in such periods.    Proceeds from sales and maturities
of investment securities available for sale were $55.1 million and $20.6 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $37.2 million and $4.5 million for the three month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. Gross realized gains and losses for the nine-month and three-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

   Note 4. Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The major components of loans in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  
   
     Allowance for Loan Losses    
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed to be sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent
risks in the loan portfolio. The allowance is provided based upon management s comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio. These factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan
portfolio, delinquency levels, actual loss experience, current economic conditions, and detailed analysis of individual loans for which the full collectability may not be assured. The detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of
loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component is calculated on an individual basis for larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans, which
are considered impaired. A specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value (less disposal costs), or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than its carrying value. The specific component of the
allowance for smaller-balance loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) is calculated on a pooled basis considering historical experience adjusted for qualitative factors. These smaller-balance TDRs were
collectively evaluated for impairment. The general component covers the remaining loan portfolio, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on loans is estimated
based upon these factors and trends identified by management at the time financial statements are prepared.    A provision for loan losses is charged
against operations and is added to the allowance for loan losses based on quarterly comprehensive analyses of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is allocated to certain loan categories based on the relative risk characteristics, asset
classifications and actual loss experience of the loan portfolio. While management has allocated the allowance for loan losses to various loan portfolio segments, the allowance is general in nature and is available for the loan portfolio in its
entirety.

  Management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process
designed to help grade the quality of the Bank s loan portfolio. The Bank s loan ratings coincide with the  Substandard,   Doubtful  and  Loss  classifications used by federal regulators in their examination
of financial institutions. Generally, an asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by
the distinct possibility that the insured financial institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in assets classified Substandard with the added
characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible, and of such little value
that its continuance on the books is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured financial institutions to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but otherwise possess weaknesses are
designated  Special Mention.  Management also maintains a listing of loans designated  Watch . These loans represent borrowers with declining earnings, strained cash flow, increasing leverage and/or weakening market fundamentals
that indicate above average risk. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Bank had no loans graded  Doubtful  or  Loss  included in the balance of total loans outstanding.

  Loans may be placed in nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to
meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received. Payments received are first applied to
principal, and any remaining funds are then applied to interest. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they are deemed a loss and charged to the allowance, transferred to foreclosed assets, or returned to accrual status based upon
performance consistent with the original terms of the loan or a subsequent restructuring thereof.    The following table presents an age analysis of
nonaccrual and past due loans by category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:     Analysis of Past Due and Nonaccrual

    Impaired Loans    
 A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments due in accordance
with the original or modified terms of the loan agreement. Smaller balance homogenous loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment. Non-homogenous impaired loans are either measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral less
estimated cost to sell if the loan is considered collateral dependent, or measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows if not collateral dependent. The valuation of real estate collateral is subjective in nature and may be
adjusted in future periods because of changes in economic conditions. Management considers third-party appraisals, as well as independent fair market value assessments in determining the estimated fair value of particular properties. In addition, as
certain of these third-party appraisals and independent fair market value assessments are only updated periodically, changes in the values of specific properties may have occurred subsequent to the most recent appraisals. Accordingly, the amounts of
any such potential changes and any related adjustments are generally recorded at the time such information is received. When the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by creating
or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the
principal balance.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $10.8
million and $11.2 million. The total amount of collateral-dependent impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, was $1.5 million and $1.1 million. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, $1.9 million and $2.1 million of the recorded investment in impaired loans did not have a related allowance. The Bank had $10,253,379 and $10,710,411 in troubled debt restructured loans included in impaired loans at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    The categories of non-accrual loans and impaired loans overlap, although they are not coextensive. The
Bank considers all circumstances regarding the loan and borrower on an individual basis when determining whether an impaired loan should be placed on non-accrual status, such as the financial strength of the borrower, the estimated collateral value,
reasons for the delay, payment record, the amount past due and the number of days past due.    In 2015, management began collectively evaluating performing
TDRs with a loan balance of $250,000 or less for impairment. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, $6.0 million and $6.2 million of TDRs included in the following table were evaluated collectively for impairment and
were deemed to have $311 thousand and $317 thousand of related allowance.

    Troubled Debt Restructuring    
 A troubled debt restructured loan is a loan for which the Bank, for reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
borrower that the Bank would not otherwise consider.    The loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower s financial
difficulty, include but are not limited to: a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity at an interest rate below current market; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or re-aging,
extensions, deferrals and renewals. Troubled debt restructured loans are considered impaired loans.    The following table sets forth information with
respect to the Bank s troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:     For the Nine Months ended

   Note 5. Employee Benefit Plan   
 The Bank has a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all of its employees. Effective December 31, 2012, the
pension plan was amended to freeze benefit accruals for all eligible employees. The following is a summary of net periodic pension costs for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   
   It has been Bank practice to contribute the maximum tax-deductible amount each year as determined by the plan administrator.
As a result of prior year contributions exceeding the minimum requirements, a Prefunding Balance existed as of December 31, 2015 and there is no required contribution for 2016. Based on this we do not anticipate making a contribution to the
plan in 2016.     Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies   
 The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
   The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit
and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance sheet instruments. A summary of the
Bank s commitments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows:      
   Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on
management s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties.  
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are
primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified
above and is required in instances which the Bank deems necessary.

    Concentrations of Credit Risk    
 Substantially all of the Bank s loans, commitments to extend credit, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Bank s
market area and such customers are generally depositors of the Bank. Investments in state and municipal securities involve governmental entities within and outside the Bank s market area. The distribution of commitments to extend credit
approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. Standby letters of credit are granted primarily to commercial borrowers. The Bank s primary focus is toward small business and consumer transactions, and accordingly, it does not have a
significant number of credits to any single borrower or group of related borrowers in excess of $4.0 million. The Bank has cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions which exceed federally insured limits.  
  Note 7. Financial Instruments     FASB ASC 825,
 Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using present value of future cash flows or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. FASB ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from
its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.    The following
presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This table excludes financial instruments for which the
carrying amount approximates fair value. For short-term financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its
expected realization. For financial liabilities such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to these products having no stated maturity.

Note 7. Financial Instruments, continued   
   
  The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities
and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available for sale and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a
nonrecurring basis, such as loans or foreclosed assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.  
   Fair Value Hierarchy      Under FASB ASC 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , the Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to
determine fair value. These levels are:    Level 1   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active
markets.    Level 2   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.  
 Level 3   Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market.
These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques.    Following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.  
   Investment Securities Available for Sale    
 Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If
quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment
assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active
over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. Securities classified as Level 3 include asset-backed
securities in less liquid markets.      Loans      The
Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will
not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. If a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The fair value of
impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for
which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. At September 30, 2016, a small percentage of the total impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral. In
accordance with accounting standards, impaired loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market
price the Company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When the fair value is based on either an external or internal appraisal and there is no observable market price, the Company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3.

    Foreclosed Assets    
 Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of
carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable
market price the Company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When the fair value of the collateral is based on either an external or internal appraisal and there is no observable market price, the Company records the foreclosed
asset as nonrecurring Level 3.      Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
   
   No liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. There
were no significant transfers between levels during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015.

    Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis    
 The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets and liabilities that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. No liabilities were recorded at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are included in the table below.      
   For Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and

   Note 8. Subsequent Events   
 Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. Recognized subsequent events
are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. Non-recognized subsequent events are
events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date. Management has evaluated events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date through the date these financial statements
were issued, determining no events require additional disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         
      General   
 The following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.  
  Critical Accounting Policies     For a discussion of the
Company s critical accounting policies, including its allowance for loan losses, see the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  Results of Operations       Results of Operations for
the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015      Overall, the Company recorded pre-tax earnings of $1.5 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 compared to pre-tax earnings of $592 thousand for the same period in 2015. Income tax expense increased by $288 thousand from the third quarter of 2015 to 2016 resulting net income of $1.0 million for the third quarter of
2016 compared to net income of $416 thousand for the same period in 2015. The increase in pretax earnings of $918 thousand from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016 was due primarily to the merger with Cardinal which was completed
on July 1, 2016.    Total interest income increased by $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended
September 30, 2015, while interest expense on deposits increased by $129 thousand over the same period. The increase in interest income was attributable primarily to the merger with Cardinal which added approximately $157.9 million in loans and
$16.0 million in investment securities to the Company s earning assets. While interest on loans increased based upon the increased balances, the prolonged low interest rate environment combined with increasing competitive pressures continues to
place downward pressure on overall loan yields. Interest expense on deposits increased by $129 thousand due to the addition of interest-bearing deposits from the Cardinal merger. The average interest rate paid for deposits continues to decrease as
longer term time deposits continue to reprice at current lower rates. Interest expense on borrowings decreased by $121 thousand due to a reduction in borrowings of $10.0 million early in 2016. Net interest income in the third quarter of 2016 was
also positively impacted by approximately $587 thousand as a result of accretion of loan discounts and deposit premiums, net of amortization of core deposit intangibles, as established in purchase accounting fair value adjustments. The result was an
increase in net interest income of $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter last year.    The provision for
loan losses was $109 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to a negative $14,607 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The reserve for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was approximately 0.86% of total loans,
compared to 1.51% at September 30, 2015. The decrease in the reserve percentage was due to the Cardinal acquisition and the application of purchase accounting guidance which required the elimination of Cardinal s loan loss reserves.
Management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Cardinal loan portfolio was reflected as a purchase discount which will be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans. Management believes the
provision and the resulting allowance for loan losses are adequate.    Total noninterest income was $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to
$628 thousand in the third quarter of 2015. The $639 thousand increase was due primarily to the Cardinal merger. Service charges on deposit accounts as well as other account-based service charges and fees increased due to the increased number of
accounts and deposit balances. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cardinal acquisition, when compared with the value of consideration paid, resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $182 thousand which is included in
other income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         
       
  Total noninterest expenses increased by $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to the Cardinal acquisition. Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $949 thousand as the number of employees increased from approximately 110, prior to the combination, to 185 after the
combination. Merger related expenses totaled $484 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $48 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
   Results of Operations for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total interest income increased by $2.6 million compared to the nine-month period ended September 30,
2015. As noted in the above discussion, the Company s operations were impacted by the July 1, 2016 completion of the merger with Cardinal. The increase in income was due primarily to the increase in loans resulting from the merger.
Interest income on investment securities decreased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 due to declining interest rates as well as a decrease in the average balances of investment securities held. The Company s investment
securities decreased from September 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016, as investments were liquidated to fund loan growth and the repayment of borrowings. The increase in investment securities from Cardinal did not offset the pre-merger reduction
in the Company s balances. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $66 thousand for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as interest expense on acquired deposit balances was more than offset by continued decreases in deposit
rates as higher-yielding time deposits reprice to lower rates or migrate to lower-yielding non-maturity deposits. Interest on borrowings decreased by $308 thousand due to the repayment of $10 million in borrowings February of 2016. As noted in the
discussion above, net interest income in the third quarter of 2016 was also positively impacted by approximately $587 thousand as a result of accretion of loan discounts and deposit premiums, net of amortization of core deposit intangibles, as
established in purchase accounting fair value adjustments.    The provision for loan losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $14
thousand, compared to a negative $119,350 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The negative provision in 2015 was due to improvement in the bank s overall asset quality as evidenced by lower levels of charge-offs,
non-performing assets, and past-due loans, when compared to prior years. Asset quality has remained relatively consistent over the past year.    Noninterest
income increased by $970 thousand for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Income from service charges and fees increased primarily as result of the merger with Cardinal. Securities gains increased by $265 thousand as
investment securities were liquidated to fund loan growth and the repayment of borrowings. As noted above, other income for the period ended in 2016 includes a $182 thousand bargain purchase gain resulting from the Cardinal acquisition.  
 Total noninterest expenses increased by $2.6 million, or 31.92% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.
Salaries and employee benefits increased by $836 thousand due primarily to the aforementioned increase in employees resulting from the Cardinal merger. Merger related expenses totaled $720 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $48 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    In total, income before taxes increased by $1.3 million over the first nine
months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. Income tax expense increased by $490 thousand over the prior year, resulting in an increase in net income of $777 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         
       
   Financial Condition   
 Effective July 1, 2016 the Company completed its previously announced merger with Cardinal, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
November 6, 2015. In connection with the merger with Cardinal, the Company acquired $252.4 million in assets at fair value, including $157.9 million in loans and $59.0 million in investment securities. The Company also assumed $228.7 million of
liabilities at fair value, including $219.3 million of total deposits with a core deposit intangible asset recorded of $2.5 million.    With the Cardinal
merger, total assets increased by $227.3 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Net loans increased by $167.3 million, federal funds sold increased by $14.8 million, interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by $14.8
million and investment securities increased by $3.2 million. Approximately $43.0 million of the investment securities acquired in the Cardinal merger were called or sold subsequent to the merger.  
 Total deposits increased by $210.7 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Borrowings decreased by $10.0 million due to prepayment of
borrowings scheduled to mature in February of 2017.    Nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loans, loans past due more than ninety days and foreclosed
assets, increased slightly from $2.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $2.1 million at September 30, 2016. Foreclosed assets consists of one property totaling $70 thousand at September 30, 2016. A total of six foreclosed properties were
disposed of in the first nine months of 2016. Proceeds from the sale of these properties totaled $326 thousand representing a net loss on disposal of $37 thousand. All foreclosed properties are being marketed for sale. Loans past due more than
ninety days, and still accruing interest, were $29 thousand at September 30, 2016. There were no loans past due more than ninety days and still accruing interest at December 31, 2015.  
 Nonaccrual loans increased from $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $2.0 million at September 30, 2016. During the first nine months of 2016, loans
totaling $1.4 million were added to nonaccrual status while loans totaling $224 thousand were removed from nonaccrual status. Loans are generally placed in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or
more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.    The following table summarizes nonperforming assets:

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         
       
  Loans less than 90 days past due may be placed in nonaccrual status if management determines that payment in
full of principal or interest is not expected. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they are deemed a loss and charged to the allowance, transferred to foreclosed assets, or returned to accrual status based upon performance consistent with
the original terms of the loan or a subsequent restructuring thereof. Management continues to closely monitor nonperforming assets and their impact on earnings and loan loss reserves.  
 At September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses included $562 thousand specifically reserved for impaired loans in the amount of $9.0
million. Based on impairment analysis, loans totaling $1.9 million were also considered to be impaired but did not require a specific reserve or the related reserve had previously been charged-off. Impaired loans at December 31, 2015
totaled $11.2 million, of which $9.1 million required specific reserves of $591 thousand.     Summary of Loan Loss Experience   
   
   Certain types of loans, such as option ARM (adjustable rate mortgage) products, interest-only loans, subprime loans and loans
with initial teaser rates, can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. The Bank has not offered these types of loans in the past and does not offer them currently. Junior-lien mortgages can also be considered higher risk loans. Our
junior-lien portfolio at September 30, 2016 totaled $4.2 million, or 1.83% of total loans. Historical charge-off rates in this category have not varied significantly from other real estate secured loans.

  Stockholders  equity totaled $56.3 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $30.7 million at
December 31, 2015. Equity was significantly impacted by the merger with Cardinal as illustrated in the Company s  Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders  Equity located in Item 1 above.  
  Liquidity     Liquidity is the ability to convert assets to
cash to fund depositors  withdrawals or borrowers  loans without significant loss. Unsecured federal fund lines available from correspondent banks totaled $15,000,000 at September 30, 2016. No balances were outstanding on these lines
at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Long-term debt consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and Deutsche Bank. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which are secured by a blanket collateral agreement on the
Bank s 1 to 4 family residential real estate loans, totaled $10,000,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Borrowings from Deutsche Bank, which are secured by the pledging of specific investment securities, totaled
$10,000,000 at December 31, 2015. The Deutsche Bank borrowing was paid in full in February 2016 therefore no balances were outstanding at September 30, 2106. The unused credit line from the Federal Home Loan Bank as of September 30,
2016 is approximately $69,300,000.    The Bank uses cash and federal funds sold to meet its daily funding needs. If funding needs are met through holdings
of excess cash and federal funds, then profits might be sacrificed as higher-yielding investments are foregone in the interest of liquidity. Therefore management determines, based on such items as loan demand and deposit activity, an appropriate
level of cash and federal funds and seeks to maintain that level.    The Bank s investment security portfolio also serves as a source of liquidity. The
primary goals of the investment portfolio are liquidity management and maturity gap management. As investment securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested in federal funds sold if the federal funds level needs to be increased; otherwise the
proceeds are reinvested in similar investment securities. The majority of investment security transactions consist of replacing securities that have been called or matured. The Bank keeps a portion of its investment portfolio in unpledged assets
with average lives or repricing terms of less than 60 months. These investments are a preferred source of funds because their market value is not as sensitive to changes in interest rates as investments with longer durations.  
 As a result of the steps described above, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors 
requirements and meet its customers  credit needs.     Capital Resources   
 A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base. Federal regulations have classified and defined capital into the
following components: (1) Tier 1 capital, which includes common shareholders  equity and qualifying preferred equity, and (2) Tier 2 capital, which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses, certain qualifying long-term debt
and preferred stock which does not qualify as Tier 1 capital. Financial institutions and holding companies were also subject to the new BASEL III requirements starting the first quarter of 2015. A new part of the capital ratios profile is the Common
Equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio. Minimum capital levels are regulated by risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, which require a financial institution to maintain capital as a percentage of its assets, and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for
predefined credit risk factors (risk-adjusted assets).    Regulatory guidelines relating to capital adequacy provide minimum risk-based ratios at the Bank
level which assess capital adequacy while encompassing all credit risks, including those related to off-balance sheet activities. At September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank both exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements and are
considered to be  well capitalized.
