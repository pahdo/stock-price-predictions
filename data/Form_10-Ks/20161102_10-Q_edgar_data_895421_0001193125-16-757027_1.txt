1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation   
  The Firm    Morgan Stanley, a financial
holding company, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries
and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
 Morgan Stanley  or the  Firm  mean Morgan Stanley (the  Parent ) together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  
 For a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm s business segments, see Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements in the Firm s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).  
  Basis of Financial Information     The
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), which require the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of
certain financial instruments, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, compensation, deferred tax assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, allowance for credit losses and other matters that affect its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Firm s
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2015 Form 10-K. Certain footnote disclosures included in the 2015 Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted from the consolidated financial statements as they are not required for
interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The
results of
opera- 

tions for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.  
   Consolidation      The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain variable interest entities ( VIE ) (see Note 12). For
consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net
income (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income. The portion of shareholders  equity of such subsidiaries that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as
noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the consolidated balance sheets.    For a discussion of the Firm s VIEs and
its significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries, see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K. See also Note 2 herein.  
   Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Presentation    
 The adoption of the accounting update,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  (see Note 2) on January 1, 2016, resulted in a net
noncash increase in total assets of $126 million. In the prior year period, the Firm deconsolidated approximately $191 million in net assets previously attributable to noncontrolling interests that were related to a real estate fund sponsored by the
Firm. The deconsolidation resulted in a non-cash reduction of assets of $169 million.      Global Oil Merchanting Business    
 As a result of entering into a definitive agreement to sell the global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton
Commodities International LLC, on May 11, 2015, the Firm recognized an impairment charge of $10 million in the prior year quarter and $69 million in the prior year period in Other revenues to reduce the carrying amount of the unit to its
estimated fair value less costs to sell. The Firm closed the transaction on November 1, 2015. The transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and did not have a material impact on the Firm s financial results.

2. Significant Accounting Policies   
 For a detailed discussion about the Firm s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the
2015 Form 10-K.    During the current year period, other than the following, there were no significant updates made to the Firm s
significant accounting policies.     Accounting Standards Adopted   
 The Firm adopted the following accounting updates as of January 1, 2016.  

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities.      In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued an accounting update that changes the requirements for the recognition and measurement of certain financial assets
and financial liabilities. The Firm early adopted the provision in this guidance relating to liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to a fair value option election that requires presenting unrealized DVA in Other comprehensive income (loss)
( OCI ), a change from the previous requirement to present DVA in net income. Realized DVA amounts will be recycled from AOCI to Trading revenues. DVA amounts from periods prior to adoption remain in

Trading revenues as previously reported. A cumulative catch up adjustment, net of noncontrolling interests and tax, of $312 million was recorded as of January 1, 2016 to move the cumulative DVA
loss amount from Retained earnings into AOCI.       Other provisions of this rule may not be early adopted
and will be effective January 1, 2018, and are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.      

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.      In February 2015, the FASB
issued an accounting update that provides a new consolidation model for certain entities, such as investment funds and limited partnerships. The adoption on January 1, 2016, increased total assets by $131 million, reflecting consolidations of
$206 million net of deconsolidations of $75 million. The consolidations resulted primarily from certain funds in Investment Management where the Firm acts as a general partner.     
  Goodwill     The Firm completed its annual
goodwill impairment testing at July 1, 2016. The Firm s impairment testing did not indicate any goodwill impairment, as each of the Firm s reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying
value.

2. 
   For trading purposes, the Firm holds or sells short equity securities issued by entities in diverse industries and of
varying sizes.     

3. 
   For positions with the same counterparty that cross over the levels of the fair value hierarchy, both counterparty
netting and cash collateral netting are included in the column titled  Counterparty and Cash Collateral Netting.  For contracts with the same counterparty, counterparty netting among positions classified within the same level is included
within that shared level. For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 4.    

4. 
   Amounts exclude certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value ( NAV ) per
share, which are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. For additional disclosure about such investments, see  Fair Value of Investments Measured at Net Asset Value  herein.

For a description of the valuation techniques applied to the Firm s major categories of
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K. During the current quarter and current year period, there were no significant updates made to the
Firm s valuation techniques.     Changes in Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  
 The following tables present additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for all
periods presented. Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains (losses) for assets and liabilities within the Level 3
category presented in the following tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories.  
 Additionally, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Firm has
classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the following tables herein
may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.     Roll-forward of Level 3 Assets and

Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements   
 The following disclosures provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and their ranges and averages for
each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the
inventory. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm s inventory. The following disclosures also include qualitative
information on the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in the significant unobservable inputs.     Valuation Techniques and Sensitivity of

   Amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are provided when more
relevant.     

2. 
   Credit valuation adjustments ( CVA ) and funding valuation adjustments ( FVA ) are included in the
balance but excluded from the Valuation Technique(s) and Significant Unobservable Inputs in the previous table. CVA is a Level 3 input when the underlying counterparty credit curve is unobservable. FVA is a Level 3 input in its entirety given the
lack of observability of funding spreads in the principal market.     

3. 
   Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).     
  Sensitivity of the fair value to changes in the unobservable inputs:   

(A) 
   Significant increase (decrease) in the unobservable input in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement.     

(B) 
   Significant changes in credit correlation may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
Increasing (decreasing) correlation drives a redistribution of risk within the capital structure such that junior tranches become less (more) risky and senior tranches become more (less) risky.     

(C) 
   Significant increase (decrease) in the unobservable input in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher)
fair value measurement.     

(D) 
   There are no predictable relationships between the significant unobservable inputs.

For a description of the Firm s significant unobservable inputs for all major categories of
assets and liabilities, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K. Following are the updates to significant unobservable inputs disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K.  

Asset Coverage      the ratio of a borrower s underlying pledged assets less
applicable costs relative to their outstanding debt (while considering the loan s principal and the seniority and security of the loan commitment).     
  Fair Value of Investments Measured at Net Asset Value   
 For a description of the Firm s investments in private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds measured at fair value based on
NAV, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.        Investments in Certain Funds Measured at NAV per Share  
   
    Non-Redeemable Funds by Projected Distribution       

Restrictions    
 Investments in hedge funds may be subject to lock-up or gate provisions. A lock-up provision is a provision which provides that during a
certain initial period an investor may not make a withdrawal from the fund. A gate provision restricts the amount of redemption that an investor can demand on any redemption date.  
  Hedge Funds Fair Value by Redemption Frequency       

1. 
   The remaining restriction period for these investments was primarily over three years.     
 The redemption notice periods for hedge funds were primarily greater than six months. Hedge fund investments representing approximately 28% of
the fair value cannot be redeemed as of September 30, 2016 because a gate provision has been imposed by the hedge fund manager, primarily for indefinite periods.

Fair Value Option   
 The Firm elected the fair value option for certain eligible instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the elected instruments and their associated risk management transactions or to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models.  
  Earnings Impact of Instruments under the Fair Value Option       

1. 
   Gains (losses) are mainly attributable to changes in foreign currency rates or interest rates or movements in the
reference price or index for short-term and long-term borrowings before the impact of related hedges. In accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities , unrealized DVA gains (losses) of $(143) million and $405 million are recorded within OCI in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and not included in this table for the current quarter and current year
period, respectively. See Notes 2 and 14 for further information.     

2. 
   Gains (losses) recorded in Trading revenues for the prior year quarter and prior year period are attributable to DVA
and the respective remainder is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates or interest rates or movements in the reference price or index for primarily structured notes before the impact of related hedges.

The amounts in the previous table are included within Net revenues and do not reflect gains or
losses on related hedging instruments, if any. In addition to the amounts in the previous table, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K, instruments within Trading assets or Trading liabilities are
measured at fair value.     Gains (Losses) due to Changes in Instrument-Specific Credit Risk   

1. 
   In accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update,  Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , for the current quarter and current year period DVA gains (losses) are recorded in OCI when unrealized and in Trading revenues when realized. In the prior year quarter and prior year period, the
realized and unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded in Trading revenues. The cumulative impact of changes in the Firm s DVA and the pre-tax amount recognized in AOCI is a loss of $56 million at September 30, 2016. See Notes 2 and 14 for
further information.     

2. 
   Loans and other debt instrument-specific credit gains (losses) were determined by excluding the non-credit components
of gains and losses, such as those due to changes in interest rates.     

3. 
   Gains (losses) on lending commitments were generally determined based on the differential between estimated expected
client yields and contractual yields at each respective period-end.        Contractual Principal Amount In Excess of Fair Value   

1. 
   The majority of the difference between principal and fair value amounts for loans and other debt relates to distressed
debt positions purchased at amounts well below par.     

2. 
   Short-term and long-term borrowings do not include structured notes where the repayment of the initial principal amount
fluctuates based on changes in a reference price or index.

Short-Term and Long-Term Borrowings Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   

Loans carried at Fair Value which are in Nonaccrual Status   

The previous tables exclude non-recourse debt from consolidated VIEs, liabilities
related to failed sales of financial assets, pledged commodities and other liabilities that have specified assets attributable to them.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on
a Non-Recurring Basis       

1. 
   Carrying values included only those assets that had fair value adjustments during the current quarter and prior year
quarter.     

2. 
   Non-recurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments held for investment were calculated using the
value of the underlying collateral. Loans and lending commitments held for sale were calculated using recently executed transactions; market price quotations; valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as
comparable loan or debt prices and credit default swap spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments; or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.

3. 
   Losses related to Other assets Other investments and Intangible assets were determined primarily using discounted
cash flow models and methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies.     

4. 
   Losses related to Other assets Other investments included a loss of approximately $35 million for the current year
period in connection with the sale of solar investments and impairments of the remaining unsold solar investments accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of these investments was determined based on the sales price.

5. 
   Losses related to Other assets Premises, equipment and software costs were determined primarily using a default
recovery analysis.     

6. 
   Losses related to Other assets Premises, equipment and software costs and Intangible assets included an impairment
charge of approximately $25 million for the current quarter in connection with an oil terminal facility, to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notional amounts of approximately $92.1 billion and
$99.5 billion, respectively, of the Firm s lending commitments were held for investment and held for sale, which are not included in the previous table. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $1,410 million and
$2,172 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Had these commitments been accounted for at fair value, $1,073 million would have been categorized in Level 2 and $337 million in Level 3 at September 30, 2016, and
$1,791 million would have been categorized in Level 2 and $381 million in Level 3 at December 31, 2015.  

The carrying values of the remaining assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the
following tables approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The previous tables exclude certain financial instruments such as equity method investments and all non-financial assets and liabilities such as the value of the long-term
relationships with the Firm s deposit customers. For a further discussion of financial instruments not measured at fair value, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.

Credit Risk-Related Contingencies   
 In connection with certain OTC trading agreements, the Firm may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any
outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade of the Firm.    The following table
presents the aggregate fair value of certain derivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position for which the Firm has posted collateral in the normal course of business.  
  Net Derivative Liabilities and Collateral Posted       
   The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating
downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) and Standard   Poor s Global Ratings ( S P ). The following table shows the future
potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade
triggers.        Incremental Collateral or Termination Payments upon Potential Future Ratings Downgrade   

1. 
   Amounts include $1,758 million related to bilateral arrangements between the Firm and other parties where upon the
downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver collateral to the other party. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are used by the Firm to manage the risk of counterparty downgrades.

Credit Derivatives and Other Credit Contracts   
 The Firm enters into credit derivatives, principally through credit default swaps, under which it receives or provides protection against the
risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. A majority of the Firm s counterparties are banks, broker-dealers and insurance and other financial institutions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
  (Unaudited)   

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K, AFS and
HTM securities with a current fair value less than their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the Firm s ongoing assessment of temporary versus other-than-temporarily impaired at the individual security level.  
 The Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that are other-than-temporarily-impaired at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 for the reasons discussed herein.    For AFS debt securities, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not
likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of amortized cost basis. For AFS and HTM debt securities, the securities have not experienced credit losses as the net unrealized losses reported in the previous table are primarily due
to higher interest rates since those securities were purchased.    Additionally, the Firm does not expect to experience a credit loss based
on consideration of the relevant information (as

discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K), including for U.S. government and agency securities, the existence of an explicit and implicit guarantee
provided by the U.S. government. The risk of credit loss on securities in an unrealized loss position is considered minimal because all of the Firm s agency securities as well as asset-backed securities ( ABS ), commercial
mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) are highly rated and because corporate bonds are all investment grade.  
 For AFS equity securities, the Firm has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in market value.    See Note 12 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency
mortgage-backed securities, non-agency CMBS, auto loan ABS, CLO and FFELP student loan ABS.

Trading Assets Pledged   
 The Firm pledges its trading assets to collateralize securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other secured financings. Pledged
financial instruments that can be sold or repledged by the secured party are identified as Trading assets (pledged to various parties) in the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of Trading
assets that have been loaned or pledged to counterparties, where those counterparties do not have the right to sell or repledge the collateral, were $40.3 billion and $35.0 billion, respectively. 
  Collateral Received     The Firm receives
collateral in the form of securities in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed and derivative transactions, customer margin loans and securities-based lending. In many cases, the Firm is permitted to
sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use the securities to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to enter into securities lending and derivative transactions or for delivery to counterparties to cover short
positions. The Firm additionally receives securities as collateral in connection with certain securities-for-securities transactions in which it is the lender. In instances where the Firm is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, it reports
the fair value of the collateral received and the related obligation to return the collateral included in Trading assets and Trading liabilities, respectively, in its consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
total fair value of financial instruments received as collateral where the Firm is permitted to sell or repledge the securities was $551.8 billion and $522.6 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been sold or repledged
was $433.8 billion and $398.1 billion, respectively.     Other   
 The Firm engages in margin lending to clients that allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. Margin loans are
included within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. Under these agreements and transactions, the Firm receives collateral, including U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations,
corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. Customer receivables generated from margin lending activities are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the Firm. The Firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms
daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin

lending were approximately $28.0 billion and $25.3 billion, respectively.    For a
further discussion of the Firm s margin lending activities, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.  
 The Firm has additional secured liabilities. For a further discussion of other secured financings, see Note 10. 
  Cash and Securities Deposited with Clearing Organizations or Segregated       

1. 
   Securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements are
sourced from Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Trading assets in the consolidated balance sheets.         
 7. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses      Loans   
 The Firm s loans held for investment are recorded at amortized cost, and its loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value in the consolidated balance sheets. For a further description of these loans, refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K. See Note 3 for further information regarding Loans and lending commitments held at

1. 
   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no allowance was outstanding for these loans as the present value of the
expected future cash flows (or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral held) equaled or exceeded the carrying value.     

2. 
   The impaired loans unpaid principal balance differs from the aggregate amount of impaired loan balances with and

debt restructurings of $52.8 million and $44.0 million related to loans and $13.9 million and $34.8 million related to lending commitments, respectively, within corporate loans. At September 30, 2016 the Firm did not record an allowance related to
these troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2015, an allowance of $5.1 million was recorded. These restructurings typically include modifications of interest rates, collateral requirements, other loan covenants, and payment extensions.

Employee Loans   
 Employee loans are granted primarily in conjunction with a program established in the Wealth Management business segment to retain and recruit
certain employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are full recourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. The Firm
establishes an allowance for loan amounts it does not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense. At September 30, 2016, the Firm had $4,821 million of employee loans, net of an allowance of approximately $96
million. At December 31, 2015, the Firm had $4,923 million of employee loans, net of an allowance of approximately $108 million.

accounted for as Trading assets. See Note 12 for further information on Other secured financings related to VIEs and securitization activities.

For further information on derivative contracts, see Note 4.     

2. 
   These amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties totaling $0.8 billion due

or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another
entity s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.    For more information
on the nature of the obligation and related business activity for market value guarantees, liquidity facilities, whole loan sale guarantees and general partner guarantees related to certain investment management funds, as well as the other products
in the previous table, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.     Other Guarantees and Indemnities   
 In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally
are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to trust preferred securities, indemnities and exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees are described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in the
2015 Form 10-K.

     Legal .    In the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in
various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for
substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions have
included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and

credit crisis related matters. Over the last several years, the level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies has
increased materially in the financial services industry. As a result, the Firm expects that it may become the subject of increased claims for damages and other relief and, while the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the Firm
believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and
reasonably estimable losses.    The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where
available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to
income. The Firm s future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm.  
 In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to
estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably
estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.    For certain legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm cannot reasonably
estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or governmental entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or
penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other
relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or
investigation.    For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional
losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued, but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such

losses will have a material adverse effect on the Firm s consolidated financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.  
 On July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank ( CDIB ) filed a complaint against the Firm, styled  China Development
Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley       Co. Incorporated et al ., which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County ( Supreme Court of NY ). The complaint relates to a $275 million credit
default swap referencing the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that the Firm misrepresented the risks of the STACK 2006-1 CDO
to CDIB, and that the Firm knew that the assets backing the CDO were of poor quality when it entered into the credit default swap with CDIB. The complaint seeks compensatory damages related to the approximately $228 million that CDIB alleges it has
already lost under the credit default swap, rescission of CDIB s obligation to pay an additional $12 million, punitive damages, equitable relief, fees and costs. On February 28, 2011, the court denied the Firm s motion to dismiss the
complaint. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $240 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs.  
 On January 25, 2011, the Firm was named as a defendant in  The Bank of New York Mellon Trust, National Association v. Morgan Stanley

that the Firm breached certain representations and warranties with respect to an $81 million commercial mortgage loan that was originated and transferred to the trust by the Firm. The complaint seeks, among other things, to have the Firm repurchase
the loan and pay additional monetary damages. On June 16, 2014, the court granted the Firm s supplemental motion for summary judgment, which was appealed by plaintiff. On April 27, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
vacated the judgment of the SDNY and remanded the case to the SDNY for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. A trial has been set for February 13, 2017. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes it could incur a loss in
this action of up to approximately $81 million, plus pre-judgment interest, fees and costs.    On August 7, 2012, U.S. Bank, in its

complaint on behalf of Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-10SL and Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-10SL against the Firm styled  Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-10SL, et al. v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings

    12. Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities   
  Overview     For a discussion on the
Firm s VIEs, the determination and structure of VIEs and securitization activities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.  
 As a result of adopting the accounting update,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , on January 1, 2016, certain consolidated
entities are now considered VIEs and are included in the balances at September 30, 2016. See Note 2 for further information.     Consolidated VIEs
     Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity       

1. 
   Asset-backed securitizations include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and
other types of assets including consumer or commercial assets. The value of assets is determined based on the fair value of the liabilities of and the interests owned by the Firm in such VIEs, because the fair values for the liabilities and
interests owned are more observable.     

2. 
   Other primarily includes certain operating entities, investment funds and structured transactions.

Assets and Liabilities by Balance Sheet Caption   
   
   Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations.
The assets owned by many consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not generally available to the Firm. The related liabilities issued by many consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. In certain other consolidated
VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provide additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.  
 As part of the Institutional Securities business segment s securitization and related activities, the Firm has provided, or otherwise
agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm (see Note 11).  
 In general, the Firm s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE s net assets
recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements related to consolidated
VIEs were $204 million and $37 million, respectively. The Firm also had additional maximum exposure to losses of approximately $78 million and $72 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, primarily related to
certain derivatives, commitments, guarantees and other forms of involvement.

Non-consolidated VIEs   
 The following tables include all VIEs in which the Firm has determined that its maximum exposure to loss is greater than specific thresholds
or meets certain other criteria, and exclude exposure to loss from liabilities due to immateriality. Most of the VIEs included in the following tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; the Firm s involvement generally is the result of its
secondary market-making activities, securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 5), and certain investments in funds.     Non-Consolidated VIE
Assets, Maximum and Carrying Value of Exposure to Loss

Non-Consolidated VIE Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securitization Assets   
   
   The Firm s maximum exposure to loss often differs from the carrying value of the variable interests held
by the Firm. The maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the Firm s variable interest in the VIEs and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities, other credit support, total return swaps, written put
options, and the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIEs. Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the Firm. Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying maximum exposure related to
derivatives, such amounts do not reflect fair value write-downs already recorded by the Firm.    The Firm s maximum exposure to loss
does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that the Firm may utilize to hedge these risks associated with its variable interests. In addition, the Firm s maximum exposure to loss is not reduced by the amount of
collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss.  
 Securitization transactions generally involve VIEs. Primarily as a result of its secondary market-making activities, the Firm owned additional
VIE assets mainly issued by securitization SPEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds. These additional assets totaled $13.3 billion and $12.9 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These
assets were either retained in connection with transfers of assets by the Firm, acquired in connection with secondary market-making activities or held as AFS securities in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 5) or held as investments in
funds. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these assets consisted of securities backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans or other consumer loans, such as credit card receivables, automobile loans and student loans,
CDOs or CLOs, and investment funds. The Firm s primary risk exposure is to the securities issued by the SPE owned by the Firm, with the risk highest on the most subordinate class

of beneficial interests. These assets generally are included in Trading assets Corporate and other debt, Trading assets Investments or AFS securities within its Investment securities
portfolio and are measured at fair value (see Note 3). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, such as liquidity facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. The Firm s maximum
exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned.    Transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal,
transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment are shown below.    Transfers of Assets with Continuing Involvement  

1. 
   Amounts include CLO transactions managed by unrelated third parties.     

2. 
   Amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors.

Transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are
recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles. Investment banking underwriting net revenues are recognized in connection with these
transactions. The Firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of
such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income.     Proceeds from New Securitization Transactions and Retained Interests in
Securitization Transactions       
   Net gains on sale of assets in securitization transactions at the time of the sale were not material for all
periods presented.    The Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for representations and warranties regarding certain
assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm (see Note 11).

Proceeds from Sales to CLO Entities Sponsored by Non-Affiliates   
   
   Net gains on sale of corporate loans to CLO transactions at the time of sale were not material for all periods
presented.    The Firm also enters into transactions in which it sells equity securities and contemporaneously enters into bilateral OTC
equity derivatives with the purchasers of the securities, through which it retains the exposure to the securities as shown in the following table.     Carrying and
Fair Value of Assets Sold and Retained Interest Exposure       
    Failed Sales   
 For transfers that fail to meet the accounting criteria for a sale, the Firm continues to recognize the assets in Trading assets at fair
value, and the Firm recognizes the associated liabilities in Other secured financings at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10).  
 The assets transferred to certain unconsolidated VIEs in transactions accounted for as failed sales cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm
and are not generally available to the Firm. The related liabilities are also non-recourse to the Firm. In certain other failed sale transactions, the Firm has the right to remove assets or provide additional recourse through derivatives such as
total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.     Carrying Value of Assets and Liabilities Related to Failed Sales

13. Regulatory Requirements   
  Regulatory Capital Framework     For a
discussion of the Firm s regulatory capital framework, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.     Risk-Based
Capital Requirement    The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital
requirements. The Firm s binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk-weighted assets ( RWAs ) and market risk
RWAs (the  Standardized Approach ) and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the  Advanced Approach ).  
 In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, the Firm will be subject to:  

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;     

The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer, currently set by banking regulators at zero
(collectively, the  buffers ).       In 2016, the phase-in amount for each of the buffers is 25% of the fully
phased-in buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers will result in restrictions on the Firm s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to
executive officers.    The methods for calculating each of the Firm s risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as
aspects of the capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in the Firm s reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to its capital base, asset composition, off-balance
sheet exposures or risk profile.   For a further discussion of the Firm s calculation of risk-based capital ratios, see Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.

The Firm s Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Firm s binding ratios are based on the Advanced Approach transitional rules.  
  Regulatory Capital       
     
       N/A NotApplicable  

1. 
   Percentages represent minimum regulatory capital ratios under the transitional rules.     

2. 
   Tier 1 leverage ratios are calculated under Standardized Approach transitional rules.     

3. 
   Adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily
balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under U.S. GAAP during the calendar quarter, adjusted for disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of
unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.        U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  Regulatory Capital and Capital
Ratios     Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ( MSBNA ) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association ( MSPBNA )
(collectively,  U.S. Bank Subsidiaries ) are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements as the Firm. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Firm s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each of the Firm s U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.

      Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies, U.S. depository institutions, in
order to be considered well-capitalized, must maintain certain minimum capital ratios. Each U.S. depository institution subsidiary of the Firm must be well-capitalized in order for the Firm to continue to qualify as a financial
holding company and to continue to engage in the broadest range of financial activities permitted for financial holding companies. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Firm s U.S.

Bank Subsidiaries maintained capital at levels sufficiently in excess of the universally mandated well-capitalized requirements to address any additional capital needs and requirements
identified by the U.S. federal banking regulators.     Broker-Dealer Regulatory Capital Requirements   
 Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ) is a registered broker-dealer and registered futures commission merchant and,
accordingly, is subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ). MS Co. has consistently operated with capital
in excess of its regulatory capital requirements. MS Co. s net capital totaled $10,170 million and $10,254 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which exceeded the amount required by $8,093 million and $8,458
million, respectively. MS Co. is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of SEC Rule 15c3-1. In addition,
MS Co. is required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, MS Co. had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and the notification
requirements.    Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ( MSSB LLC ) is a registered broker-dealer and introducing broker for the futures
business and, accordingly, is subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC and the CFTC. MSSB LLC has consistently operated with capital in excess of its regulatory capital requirements. MSSB LLC s net capital totaled $3,858
million and $3,613 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which exceeded the amount required by $3,711 million and $3,459 million, respectively. 
 Morgan Stanley   Co. International plc ( MSIP ), a London-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements
of the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. ( MSMS ), a Tokyo-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Agency. MSIP and MSMS have consistently
operated with capital in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements.     Other Regulated Subsidiaries   
 Certain other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm are subject to various securities, commodities and banking regulations, and capital
adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated with capital in excess of their local capital adequacy requirements.

  Dividends and Share Repurchases     The
Firm repurchased approximately $1,250 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during the current quarter and $2,500 million during the current year period. The Firm repurchased approximately $625 million
during the prior year quarter and $1,500 million in the prior year period.    For a description of the 2015 capital plan, see Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.    In June 2016, the Firm received a conditional non-objection from the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve ) to its 2016 capital plan. The capital plan included a share repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of the Firm s outstanding common stock during the period beginning
July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. Additionally, the capital plan included an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.15 per share during the period beginning with the dividend declared on July 20, 2016 (see
Note 20). The Federal Reserve Board also asked the Firm to submit an additional capital plan by December 29, 2016 addressing weaknesses identified in the Firm s capital planning process.  
  Preferred Stock     For a description of
Series A through Series J preferred stock issuances, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K. Dividends declared on the Firm s outstanding preferred stock were $78 million during the current quarter and $78
million during the prior year quarter, and $312 million during the current year period and $297 million during the prior year period. On September 15, 2016, the Firm announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend for preferred stock
shareholders of record on September 30, 2016 that was paid on October 17, 2016. The Firm is authorized to issue 30 million shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock has a preference over the common stock upon liquidation. The Firm s
preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital in accordance with regulatory capital requirements (see Note 13).

   In accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities , a cumulative catch up adjustment was recorded as of January 1, 2016 to move the cumulative DVA amount, net of noncontrolling interest and tax, related to outstanding liabilities under the fair value option
election from Retained earnings into AOCI. See Note 2 for further information.     

2. 
   Amounts reclassified from AOCI related to realized gains and losses from sales of AFS securities are classified within
Other revenues in the consolidated statements of income. The tax impact in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes resulting from such reclassifications was $(17) million in the current quarter and $(47) million in the current year period, and
$(7) million in the prior year quarter and $(27) million in the prior year period.     

3. 
   Amounts reclassified from AOCI related to realization of DVA are classified within Trading revenues in the consolidated

       Noncontrolling Interests   
 Noncontrolling interests were $1,313 million and $1,002 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase in
noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the consolidation of certain investment management funds sponsored by the Firm. See Note 2 for further information on the adoption of the accounting update  Amendments to the Consolidation

   Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) that are considered participating securities are treated as a separate class of
securities in the computation of basic EPS, and, therefore, such RSUs are not included as incremental shares in the diluted EPS computations. The diluted EPS computations also do not include weighted average antidilutive RSUs and antidilutive stock
options of 14 million shares for the current quarter and 12 million shares for the prior year quarter, and 15 million shares for the current year period and 12 million shares for the prior year period.

  Interest Income and Interest Expense       

1. 
   Interest income and expense are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the
instrument and related market conventions. When interest is included as a component of the instrument s fair value, interest is included within Trading revenues or Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is included within Interest income or
Interest expense.     

2. 
   Interest expense on Trading liabilities is reported as a reduction to Interest income on Trading assets.

3. 
   Includes fees paid on Securities borrowed.     

4. 
   Includes interest from customer receivables and other interest earning assets.

   Includes fees received on Securities loaned.     

6. 
   Includes fees received from prime brokerage customers for stock loan transactions incurred to cover customers 
short positions.          17. Employee Benefit Plans  
 The Firm sponsors various retirement plans for the majority of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Firm provides certain other postretirement
benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, to eligible U.S. employees.          Components of Net Periodic Benefit Expense (Income) for Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans       

18. Income Taxes   
 The Firm is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ) and other tax authorities in certain countries,
such as Japan and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), and in states in which it has significant business operations, such as New York. The Firm is currently at various levels of field examination with respect to audits by the IRS, as well as New
York State and New York City, for tax years 2009-2012 and 2007-2009, respectively. The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax matters will not have a material effect in the consolidated balance sheets, although a resolution could have a
material impact in the consolidated statements of income for a particular future period and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.  
 In April 2016, the Firm received a notification from the IRS that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved the final report of
an Appeals Office review of matters from tax years 1999-2005, and the Revenue Agent s Report reflecting agreed closure of the 2006-2008 tax years. The Firm has reserved the right to contest certain items, associated with tax years 1999-2005,
the resolution of which is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or the consolidated financial statements.  
 During 2017, the Firm expects to reach a conclusion with the U.K. tax authorities on substantially all issues through tax year 2010, the
resolution of which is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or the consolidated financial statements.    The
Firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Firm adjusts liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits only when more
information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.    It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the
balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months related to certain tax authority examinations referred to herein. At this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm s effective tax rate over the next 12 months.    The Firm s effective tax
rate from continuing operations for the prior year period included a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million. This net discrete tax benefit was primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally
estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the Firm s legal entity organization in the U.K.

   Effective July 1, 2016, the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments entered into an agreement
whereby Institutional Securities assumed management of Wealth Management s fixed income client-driven trading activities and pays fees to Wealth Management based on distribution activity. Prior periods have not been recast for this new
inter-segment agreement due to immateriality.     

3. 
   In certain management fee arrangements, the Firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees (also referred to as
incentive fees and includes carried interest) when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. In such arrangements, performance fee revenues are accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on
measuring account/fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement. The Firm s portion of net unrealized cumulative performance-based fees (for which the Firm is not obligated to pay
compensation) at risk of reversing if fund performance falls below stated investment management agreement benchmarks was approximately $419 million and $422 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See Note 11 for
information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.     

4. 
   The Firm waives a portion of its fees from certain registered money market funds that comply with the requirements of
Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These fee waivers resulted in a reduction of fees of approximately $26 million for the current quarter and $52 million for the prior year quarter, and $61 million for the current year period and $152
million for the prior year period.     

5.

  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley:  
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of
September 30, 2016, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and
changes in total equity for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Company.  
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of
interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding

the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    We have previously
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 23, 2016, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated statement of financial condition from which it has been derived.

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

Overview of Financial Results   
   Consolidated Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2016    

The prior year quarter included positive revenues due to the impact of debt valuation adjustments
( DVA ) of $435 million or $0.14 per diluted common share. Excluding DVA, net revenues were $7,332 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $740 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter (see
 Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( Non-GAAP ) Financial Information  herein).         

Effective January 1, 2016, we early adopted a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  that requires unrealized gains and losses from debt-related credit spreads and other credit factors to be presented in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) as opposed to
Trading revenues. Results for 2015 are not restated pursuant to that guidance.         Consolidated Results for the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016        

The prior year period included a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million or $0.29 per diluted common share,
primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues associated with DVA of $742 million or $0.24 per diluted common share. For a further discussion of the net discrete tax
benefit, see  Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures Income Tax Matters  herein.         

Net revenues excluding DVA were $26,675 million in the prior year period, while net income applicable to
Morgan Stanley was $4,742 million excluding DVA, or $2.27 per

diluted common share excluding DVA, in the prior year period. Excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefit, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $4,178 million, or $1.98 per diluted
common share, in the prior year period (see  Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( Non-GAAP ) Financial Information  herein).     
   Business Segment Net Revenues for the Current Quarter and Current Year Period    

Institutional Securities net revenues were $4,553 million in the current quarter and $12,845 million in the
current year period, an increase of 17% from the prior year quarter and a decrease of 12% from the prior year period. The current quarter results reflected improved performance across sales and trading products, partially offset by lower Investment
banking advisory and underwriting revenues. The current year period results reflected lower revenues in sales and trading and underwriting, partially offset by higher results in M A advisory.     

Wealth Management net revenues of $3,881 million in the current quarter and $11,360 million in the current
year period increased 7% from the prior year quarter and were essentially flat compared with the prior year period. The current quarter results reflected higher revenues related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation
plans and growth in net interest income. The current year period results reflected growth in net interest income, partially offset by lower asset management, distribution and administration fees.     

Investment Management net revenues of $552 million in the current quarter increased from $274 million in the
prior year quarter and net revenues of $1,612 million in the current year period decreased from $1,694 million in the prior year period. Results reflected positive carried interest in the current quarter and significant reversal of previously
accrued carried interest associated with Asia private equity in the prior year quarter and prior year period. The current year period reflected weaker investment performance compared to the prior year period. Asset management fees were relatively
unchanged from the comparable prior year periods.         Consolidated Non-Interest Expenses for the Current Quarter and
Current Year Period        

Compensation and benefits expenses of $4,097 million in the current quarter and $11,795 million in the current
year period increased 19% and decreased 5% from $3,437 million in the prior year quarter and $12,366 million in the prior year period. The current quarter results primarily reflected an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain
deferred compensation plans are referenced, an increase in carried interest payable to employees, and an increase in discretionary incentive compensation driven

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

mainly by higher revenues. The current year period results reflected a decrease in discretionary incentive compensation driven mainly by lower revenue, and a decrease in salaries due to lower
headcount, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.         

Non-compensation expenses were $2,431 million in the current quarter and $7,213 million in the current year
period compared with $2,856 million in the prior year quarter and $7,995 million in the prior year period, representing a 15% and a 10% decrease, respectively, primarily due to lower litigation costs.     
   Return on Average Common Equity        

The annualized return on average common equity was 8.7% in the current quarter and 7.7% in the current year
period. For the prior year quarter, the annualized return on average common equity was 5.6%, or 3.9% excluding DVA. For the prior year period, the annualized return on average common equity was 9.8%, or 8.8% excluding DVA, and 7.7% excluding DVA and
the net discrete tax benefit (see  Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( Non-GAAP ) Financial Information  herein).     
  Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( Non-GAAP ) Financial Information   
 We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ).
From time to time, we may disclose certain  non-GAAP financial measures  in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. A  non-GAAP financial measure  excludes,
or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us are provided as additional information to investors and analysts in order to provide
them with further transparency about, or as an alternative method for assessing, our financial condition, operating results or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and
may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.

 DVA Debt valuation adjustments represent the change in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in our credit spreads and other credit factors
related to liabilities carried at fair value, primarily certain Long-term and Short-term borrowings.  

1. 
   Pre-tax profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and
analysts to assess operating performance and represents income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues, which are two U.S. GAAP reported amounts, without adjustment.     

2. 
   Average common equity and return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures we consider to be useful
measures to us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance. Average common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework, an
internal capital adequacy measure (see  Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Attribution of Average Common Equity according to the Required Capital Framework  herein). Each business segment s return on
average common equity equals annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity for that segment. Effective tax rates used in the computation are determined on a separate legal entity
basis. Consolidated return on average common equity equals annualized consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity.     

3. 
   In accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , unrealized DVA gains (losses) in the current quarter and current year period are recorded within OCI in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In the prior year quarter and prior year
period, the DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income. See Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further information.

   Net revenues, excluding DVA, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, excluding DVA, net income applicable to Morgan
Stanley, excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefit, earnings per diluted common share, excluding DVA, earnings per diluted common share, excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefit and effective income tax rate from continuing operations, excluding

performance. For a discussion of tangible common equity, see  Liquidity and Capital Resources Tangible Equity  herein.     

2. 
   Return on average common equity equals annualized consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred
dividends as a percentage of average common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculation of the return on average common equity excluding DVA
to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average common equity, excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted to exclude those items.

3. 
   The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(62) million and
$(550) million in the current quarter and prior year quarter, respectively. The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(118) million and $(684) million in the current year period and prior year
period, respectively. The impact of the net discrete tax benefit on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $395 million in the prior year period.     

4. 
   Return on average tangible common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a
percentage of average tangible common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculation of return on average tangible common equity excluding DVA
to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average tangible common equity, excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and the denominator were adjusted to exclude
the impact of DVA and the impact of net discrete tax benefits. The impact of DVA was 2.0% and 1.2% in the prior year quarter and prior year period, respectively. The impact of the net discrete tax benefit was 1.3% in the prior year period.

Return on Equity Target   
 We are aiming to improve our return to shareholders, and accordingly have established a target return on average common equity, excluding DVA,
( Return on Equity ) to be achieved by 2017, subject to the successful execution of our strategic objectives. For further information on our Return on Equity target and related assumptions, see  Management s Discussion and

    Business Segments  
 Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to the business segments. Certain revenues and
expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.  
 As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminations
category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.      Net Revenues and Compensation Expense

Advisory revenues decreased in the current quarter and increased in the current year period reflecting lower
completed M A activity in the current quarter and higher completed M A activity in the current year period (see Investment Banking Volumes table).         

Equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of a shift in product mix in the current quarter and due to
lower equity related offerings in the current year period (see Investment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in the current quarter primarily due to lower loan fees, partially offset by higher bond fees. In the

   In accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , unrealized DVA gains (losses) in the current quarter and current year period are recorded within OCI in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In the prior year quarter and prior year
period, the DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income. See Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further information.     
   Sales and Trading Net Revenues during the Current Quarter    
   Equity        

Equity sales and trading net revenues were $1,883 million, an increase from the comparable prior year period
reflecting improved performance in derivatives and cash products due to improved market conditions, and increased activity in some derivative products.     
   Fixed Income        

Excluding the $335 million positive impact of DVA on prior year quarter results, fixed income net revenues of
$1,479 million in the current quarter were higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to credit products, which benefited from an improved credit market environment, and improved market conditions for interest rate products. The increase was
partially offset by the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. For more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations Business Segments Institutional Securities Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items 2015 Compared with

Other        

Other sales and trading net losses of $192 million in the current quarter increased from the comparable prior
year period primarily reflecting losses in the current quarter associated with corporate loan hedging activity compared with gains in the prior year quarter.     
   Sales and Trading Net Revenues during the Current Year Period    
   Equity        

Equity sales and trading net revenues were $6,084 million, a decrease from the comparable prior year period,
primarily reflecting lower revenues in cash products due to reduced volumes in international markets, partially offset by improved performance in prime brokerage across regions.     
   Fixed Income        

Excluding the $545 million positive impact of DVA on the prior year period, fixed income net revenues of
$3,649 million in the current year period were lower than the prior year period primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, as discussed herein, and lower results in foreign exchange driven mainly by lower
volumes, partially offset by an improved credit market environment.         Other    

Other sales and trading net losses of $619 million in the current year increased from the comparable prior
year period primarily reflecting losses in the current year period associated with corporate loan hedging activity compared with gains in the prior year period.     
  Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses and Other Items   
   Investments        

Net investment gains of $36 million in the current quarter decreased from the prior year quarter as a result
of lower gains on real estate and business related investments and losses on investments associated with our compensations plans compared to gains in the prior year quarter. Net investment gains of $144 million in the current year period decreased
from the comparable prior year period primarily reflecting losses on investments associated with our compensations plans compared to gains in the prior year period and lower gains on real estate investments, partially offset by higher gains on
business related investments.

Other        

Other revenues of $243 million were recognized in the current quarter compared with negative revenues of $112
million in the prior year quarter. Other revenues were $385 million in the current year period and $190 million in the prior year period. Results in both current quarter and current year period reflected mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale
compared with mark-to-market losses in the comparable prior year periods, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1
for further information). In the current year period, results also reflected an increase in the allowance for losses on loans held for investment.     
   Non-interest Expenses    
 Non-interest expenses of $3,170 million in the current quarter and $9,048 million in the current year period decreased from the comparable
prior year periods. Results reflected a 20% reduction in Non-compensation expenses, partially offset by a 26% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses in the current quarter. In the current year period, results reflected an 11% reduction in
Compensation and benefits expenses and a 15% reduction in Non-compensation expenses.      

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to an increase in the fair
value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced and an increase in discretionary incentive compensation driven mainly by higher revenues. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year period
primarily due to a decrease in discretionary incentive compensation driven mainly by lower revenues and a decrease in salaries due to lower headcount, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred
compensation plans are referenced.         

Non-compensation expenses decreased in the current quarter and current year period primarily due to lower
litigation costs. In the prior year quarter and prior year period, Non-compensation expenses included a reserve for the settlement of a credit default swap ( CDS ) antitrust litigation. For more information on the CDS antitrust litigation,
see  Legal Proceedings  in Part I, Item 3 of the 2015 Form 10-K.         Noncontrolling Interests

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

Transactional revenues of $791 million in the current quarter increased 21% from the prior year quarter
primarily reflecting higher revenues related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans partially offset by lower commission revenues.  
 Transactional revenues of $2,316 million in the current year period decreased 6% from the prior year period due to lower revenues in
Investment banking and Commissions and fees, partially offset by higher revenues in Trading.      

Investment banking revenues decreased in the current quarter due to lower fixed income revenues as a result of
the Fixed Income Integration. The decrease in the current year period was due to lower revenues from unit investments trusts, equity and structured products, partially offset by increased levels of preferred underwriting activity.

Trading revenues increased in the current quarter and the current year period primarily due to gains related
to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and higher revenues from fixed income products, partially offset by decreases from the Fixed Income Integration.     

Commissions and fees decreased in the current quarter and current year period reflected lower daily average
commissions primarily due to reduced client activity in equity and annuity products. The decrease in the current quarter was partially offset by increases from the Fixed Income Integration.     
   Asset Management        

Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,133 million in the current quarter decreased 2%
from the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower average fee rates reflecting larger client account balances with lower tiered rates, as well as shifts in the mix of investment types and strategies in fee-based accounts, partially offset
by positive flows. Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $6,269 million in the current year period decreased 3% from the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower fees from mutual funds reflecting the impact of lower
average asset levels and lower average fee rates related to fee-based accounts, partially offset by positive flows. See  Fee-Based Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type 
herein.    
 
    Net Interest        

Net interest of $885 million in the current quarter and $2,545 million in the current year period increased
18% and 17%, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods primarily due to higher loan and investment securities balances which were funded by higher average deposits.     
   Other        

Other revenues of $72 million in the current quarter and $232 million in the current year period increased 38%
and 11%, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods, due to higher realized gains from the available for sale ( AFS ) securities portfolio. The increase in Other revenues in the current year period was also due to higher referral
fees.        Non-interest Expenses  
 Non-interest expenses of $2,980 million in the current quarter increased 6% from the comparable prior year period. Non-interest expense in the
current year period was relatively unchanged from the comparable prior year period.      

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to the increase in the fair
value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced. Compensation and benefits expenses in the current year period were relatively unchanged from the prior year period.     

Non-compensation expenses decreased in the current quarter due to lower professional service costs partially
offset by higher litigation costs. Non-compensation expenses in the current year period were relatively unchanged.        Other Items
      U.S. Department of Labor Conflict of Interest Rule    
 In April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor adopted a conflict of interest rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that
broadens the circumstances under which a firm is considered a fiduciary when transacting with retail investment accounts and sets forth requirements to ensure that advice given by broker-dealers acting as investment advice fiduciaries is impartial.
The new fiduciary standard for investment advice will apply on April 10, 2017 and full compliance is required by January 1, 2018. Given the breadth and scale of our platform and continued investment in technology and infrastructure, we believe that
we will be able to provide compliant solutions to meet our clients  investment needs (see also  Business Supervision and Regulation Institutional Securities and Wealth Management Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser

Investments gains of $51 million in the current quarter and gains of $37 million in the current year period
compared with losses of $235 million and gains of $149 million in the comparable prior year periods. The current quarter reflected positive carried interest in the current quarter and current year period. The losses in the prior year quarter were
due to a reversal of previously accrued carried interest associated with Asia private equity. The current year period reflected weaker investment performance compared to the prior year period.     
   Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees       

Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $508 million in the current quarter and $1,551
million in the current year period were relatively unchanged from the comparable prior year periods, as increases in management fees, driven by higher assets under management or supervision ( AUM ) and average fee rates, were offset by
lower performance fees (see  AUM and Average Fee Rate by Asset Class  herein).        Non-interest Expenses  
 Non-interest expenses of $455 million in the current quarter and $1,353 million in the current year period increased 46% and 2% from the
comparable prior year periods primarily due to higher Compensation and benefit expenses.      

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter mainly attributed to reversal of
previously accrued carried interest in the prior year quarter. Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period primarily due to an increase in deferred compensation associated with carried interest and an increase in
amortization of the prior year compensation awards partially offset by a decrease in discretionary incentive compensation driven by lower revenues.         

Non-compensation expenses in the current quarter and current year period were relatively unchanged from the
comparable prior year periods.        Assets Under Management or Supervision   
 Effective in the second quarter of 2016, the presentation of AUM for Investment Management has been revised to better align asset classes with
its present organizational structure. With this change, the Alternative / Other products asset class now includes products in fund of funds, real estate, private equity and credit strategies, as well as multi-asset portfolios. All prior period

  Income Tax Matters     The effective tax

The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 28.7% and 24.1% for the prior year quarter
and prior year period, respectively. The results for prior year period included a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal
restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the U.K. Excluding this net discrete tax benefit, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the prior year period would have been 32.1%.  
    Accounting Development Updates   
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued the following accounting updates which apply to us. 
 The Firm considers the applicability and impact of all accounting updates. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to
be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    The following accounting
updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:      

Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This accounting update aims to clarify the principles of revenue
recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements. The core principle of this
guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
This update is effective as of January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017.         

Statement of Cash Flows. This accounting update standardizes the cash flow classification of certain cash flow
matters. This update is effective as of January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.         

Financial Instruments   Credit Losses. This accounting update impacts the impairment model for
certain financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and held to maturity debt securities. The amendments in this update will accelerate the recognition of credit losses by replacing the incurred loss impairment
methodology with a current expected credit loss ( CECL ) methodology that requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset. Additionally, although the CECL methodology will not apply to AFS debt
securities, the update will require establishment of an

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

allowance to reflect impairment of these securities, thereby eliminating the concept of a permanent write-down. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of
January 1, 2019.         

Leases. This accounting update requires lessees to recognize all leases with terms exceeding one year on the
balance sheet which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases which we currently classify as operating leases. The right of use asset and lease liability will initially be
measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.     
    Critical Accounting Policies   
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in
Item 1), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business
performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury Department, Firm Risk
Committee, Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our consolidated balance sheets, liquidity and capital
structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Board s Risk Committee.     The Balance Sheet   
 We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes
quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.  
 We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and
review variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also
monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.     Total Assets by Business Segment   

1. 
   Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits with banks.

2. 
   Other assets primarily includes Cash deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements; Other investments; Premises, equipment and software costs; Goodwill; Intangible assets and deferred tax assets.     
 A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and
trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Total assets increased to $814 billion at September 30,
2016 from $787 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in Trading assets including higher balances for U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations and corporate equities. 
   Securities Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending    
 Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase
are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1).     Collateralized Financing Transactions

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

At September 30, 2016 differences between period end balances and average balances during the
current quarter in the previous table were not significant. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned period-end balances at December 31, 2015
were lower than the average balance during 2015. The balances moved in line with client financing activity and with general movements of inventory. Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal
market, credit and/or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. Additionally, included within securities financing transactions were $13
billion and $11 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to fully collateralized securities-for-securities lending transactions represented in Trading assets.  
   Customer Securities Financing    
 The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized by
customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. Our risk exposure on
these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.  
  Liquidity Risk Management Framework     The
primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and
support the execution of our business strategies.    The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:  

Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent
outflows;         

Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;

Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and     

Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity
Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the Global Liquidity Reserve, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about our Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Risk Management Framework  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as
modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.      Global Liquidity Reserve    
 We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity
Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. For a further discussion of our Global Liquidity Reserve, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity
Risk Management Framework Global Liquidity Reserve  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K.     Global Liquidity Reserve by Type of Investment

Global Liquidity Reserve Managed by Bank and Non-Bank Legal Entities   
   
    Regulatory Liquidity Framework   
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the  Basel Committee ) has developed two standards intended for use in liquidity risk
supervision: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( LCR ) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ( NSFR ).      Liquidity Coverage
Ratio     The LCR was developed to ensure banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows
arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. This standard s objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.  
 The final rule to implement the LCR in the U.S. ( U.S. LCR ) applies to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and each is required to
calculate its respective U.S. LCR on each business day. As of January 1, 2016, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum U.S. LCR of 90%, and this minimum standard will reach the fully phased-in level of 100% beginning on
January 1, 2017. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve ) has proposed rules that would require large banking organizations, including us, to publicly disclose certain qualitative and
quantitative information about their U.S. LCR. We are compliant with the minimum required U.S. LCR based on current interpretation and we continue to evaluate its impact on our liquidity and funding requirements.  
   Net Stable Funding Ratio     The
objective of the NSFR is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress. The Basel

Committee finalized the NSFR framework in 2014. In the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered
company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which
is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures, and certain other off-balance sheet exposures based on their liquidity characteristics. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S.
Bank Subsidiaries from January 1, 2018. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that steps
will be necessary to meet the requirement, which we expect to accomplish by the effective date of the final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ
materially from estimates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Funding Management     We manage our
funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities
equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.    We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse
sources. These sources may include our equity capital, long-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements ), securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit.
We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.      Secured Financing
     For a discussion of our secured financing activities, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Management Secured Financing  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K. 
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing against less liquid assets was greater
than 120 days.      Unsecured Financing

tion and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Management Unsecured Financing  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K. When appropriate, we may use
derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1).  
  Deposits     Available funding sources to
our bank subsidiaries include demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, time deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are
sourced from our retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 deposits were $151,843 million and $156,034 million, respectively (see Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 1).     Short-Term Borrowings   
 Our unsecured short-term borrowings may consist of bank loans, bank notes, commercial paper and structured notes with maturities of 12 months
or less at issuance. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $914 million and $2,173 million, respectively, in Short-term borrowings.  
  Long-Term Borrowings    We believe that
accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of long-term borrowings allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments.
Long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product
types. Availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.  
 We may engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that we believe are in our best
interests and our investors.  
 
   Long-term Borrowings by Maturity Profile   
   
   Maturities of long-term borrowings outstanding over the next 12 months were $27,255 million and $22,396
million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.      Trust Preferred Securities    
 During the current quarter, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust III, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IV, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust V and Morgan
Stanley Capital Trust VIII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding Capital Securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. In the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. We concurrently
redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.    For further information on Long-term borrowings, see Notes 10 and 20 to
the consolidated financial statements in Item 1.     Credit Ratings   
 We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally
are impacted by, among other things, our credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as
over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes; the macroeconomic
environment; and perceived levels of government support, among other things.    Our credit ratings no longer incorporate uplift from
perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of the U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating
uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

  Positive Watch   
   In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity
provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge
additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. 
 The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can
be based on ratings by either or both of Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) and Standard   Poor s Global Ratings ( S P ). The following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and
termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of Moody s or S P ratings, based on the relevant
contractual downgrade triggers.     Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments upon Potential Future Rating Downgrade   
   
   While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions,
the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative
to peers, the

rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is
included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.     Capital Management   
 Senior management views capital as an important source of financial strength. We actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon,
among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our
capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses. We attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries  required equity.  
 We repurchased approximately $1,250 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during the current quarter
and $2,500 million during the current year period. We repurchased approximately $625 million during the prior year quarter and $1,500 million in the prior year period (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1).  
 For a description of our share repurchase program, see  Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  in Part II, Item 5 of the 2015 Form 10-K.   The Board determines the declaration and payment of
dividends on a quarterly basis. On October 19, 2016, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.20. The dividend is payable on November 15, 2016 to common shareholders of record on October 31, 2016 (see Note 20
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1).    On September 15, 2016, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend for
preferred stock shareholders of record on September 30, 2016 that was paid on October 17, 2016.

  Tangible Equity Measures Period End and Average       

1. 
   Tangible Morgan Stanley shareholders  equity and tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures that we
and investors consider to be a useful measure to assess capital adequacy.        Regulatory Requirements   
   Regulatory Capital Framework      We
are a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the  BHC Act ), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us,
including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.
The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank
Act ).    The Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the Basel III framework that, if adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, could
result in substantial changes to our capital requirements. In particular, the Basel Committee has finalized a new standardized approach methodology for calculating counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, and revised
frameworks for market risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and securitization capital requirements. In addition, the Basel Committee has proposed revisions to various regulatory capital standards, the impact of which is uncertain and
depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.

Regulatory Capital Requirements    
 We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the
calculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets ( RWAs ) and transition provisions follows. For a further discussion of these calculations, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Implementation of U.S. Basel III  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Regulatory Capital.  Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total
capital. Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as deductions for goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income and
investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. Certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.  
 In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, we will be subject to:  

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;     

The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank ( G-SIB ) capital surcharge, currently
at 3%; and         

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer ( CCyB ), currently set by banking
regulators at zero (collectively, the  buffers ).       In 2016, the phase-in amount for each of the buffers is 25%
of the fully phased-in buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to
executive officers. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory
Requirements G-SIB Capital Surcharge  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K.     Risk-Weighted Assets.  RWAs reflect both
our on- and off-balance sheet risk as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:      

Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligation to us;

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rate, indices, implied volatilities,
correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and         

Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or external events ( e.g. , fraud,
theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).       Our binding risk-based capital ratios
for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk RWAs and market risk RWAs (the  Standardized Approach ) and (ii) the

applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the  Advanced Approach ). At September 30, 2016, our binding ratios are based on the
Advanced Approach transitional rules.    The methods for calculating each of our risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1,
2022 as aspects of the capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to our capital base, asset composition, off-balance
sheet exposures or risk profile.

from the Federal Reserve and as the interpretation of the regulation evolves over time. These fully phased-in pro forma estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that we consider to be useful
measures for us, investors and analysts in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that were not yet effective at September 30, 2016. These preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially and should not be taken as a projection of what our capital ratios, RWAs, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see
 Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K.     Well-Capitalized Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios for U.S. Bank Subsidiaries   
   
   For us to remain a financial holding company, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized by
maintaining the minimum ratio requirements set forth in the previous table. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards required for us under the
capital rules. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of our risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at September 30, 2016 would have
exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require us to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial
holding company s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

 We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratios, which will become effective as a
capital standard on January 1, 2018. By January 1, 2018, we must also maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in order to avoid
limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and
discre- 

tionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition, beginning in 2018, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.

protection; (ii) reflect the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; (iii) add the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures; and (iv) apply other adjustments to Tier 1 capital, including disallowed goodwill,
transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.     
 Based on our current understanding of the rules and other factors, we estimate our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio to
be approximately 6.2% and 5.8% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. This estimate utilizes a fully phased-in Tier 1 capital numerator and a fully phased-in denominator of approximately $1,064.3 billion and $1,095.6 billion at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which takes into consideration the Tier 1 capital deductions that would be applicable in 2018 after the phase-in period has ended.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt Requirements    
 The Federal Reserve has proposed a rule for top-tier bank holding companies of U.S. G-SIBs ( covered BHCs ), including the Parent,
that establishes external total loss-absorbing capacity ( TLAC ) and long-term debt ( LTD ) requirements. The proposal contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be unsecured, have a
remaining maturity of one year or more, and not have derivative-linked features, such as structured notes. The proposal would also impose restrictions on certain liabilities that covered BHCs may incur or have outstanding, including structured
notes, as well as require all U.S. banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve with assets of at least $1 billion to make certain deductions from capital for their investments in unsecured debt issued by covered BHCs. For a further
discussion of TLAC and LTD requirements, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and

   Capital Plans and Stress Tests   
 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding
companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) framework.  
 On April 5, 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan, and summary results of the Dodd-Frank Act and CCAR supervisory stress tests were
published by the Federal Reserve in June. We exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the Federal Reserve severely adverse scenario, and our quantitative capital results improved from our prior year submission. In June
2016, we received a conditional non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 capital plan (see  Capital Management  herein). As required, we disclosed a summary of the result of our company-run stress tests on June 23, 2016. The
Federal Reserve Board also asked us to submit an additional capital plan by December 29, 2016 addressing weaknesses identified in our capital planning process. Future capital distributions may be restricted if these identified weaknesses are
not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan. Pursuant to the conditional
non- 

objection, we are able to execute the capital actions set forth in our 2016 capital plan, which included increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share beginning in the third quarter of
2016 and executing share repurchases of $3.5 billion during the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. In addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve on October 5, 2016 and we disclosed a
summary of the results on October 31, 2016.    In September 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the capital plan and stress
test rules that would, among other things, reduce the  de minimis  threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserve s prior approval. The proposal would
also establish a one-quarter  blackout period  while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR during which firms would not be permitted to submit  de minimis  exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital
distributions. The Federal Reserve is currently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements, which may increase minimum capital requirements for the Firm.  
 The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2016
annual company-run stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2016 and published a summary of their stress test results on June 23, 2016.    For a
further discussion of our capital plans and stress tests, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Capital Plans and
Stress Tests  in Part II, Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K.      Attribution of Average Common Equity according to the Required Capital Framework
     Our required capital ( Required Capital ) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital
adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. Required
Capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted
basis.    The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital
to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the difference between our total average common equity and the

Table of Contents  

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent equity. We generally hold Parent equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions
and other capital needs.    Effective January 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on
our fully phased-in regulatory capital, including supplementary leverage and stress losses (which results in more capital being attributed to the business segments), whereas prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital
provisions. Also, beginning in 2016, the amount of capital allocated to the business segments will be set at the beginning of each year, and will remain fixed throughout the year, until the next annual reset. Differences between available and
Required Capital will be reflected in Parent equity during the year. Periods prior to 2016 have not been recast under the new methodology.  
 The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to
incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.  
  Average Common Equity by Business Segment and Parent Equity

   Amounts are calculated on a monthly basis. Average common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be a
useful measure for us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy.        Regulatory Developments   
   Resolution and Recovery Planning    
 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) an annual resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set
out in our 2015 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. On September 30, 2016, we submitted a status report to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in respect of certain shortcomings identified in our 2015 resolution plan. Pursuant to the status report,
we indicated that the parent holding company will amend and restate

its support agreement with its material subsidiaries that are designed to ensure such subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity as and when needed throughout a resolution scenario. Under
the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the parent holding company will be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the
parent holding company and certain intercompany payables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material subsidiaries. The obligations of the parent holding company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured
on a senior basis by the assets of the parent holding company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent holding company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the parent holding company (other than shares in
subsidiaries of the parent holding company) will be effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent holding company. Our next full resolution plan submission will be on July 1, 2017. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were, at a
later time, to jointly determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any deficiencies at that later time, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subjected to
more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities, or operations, or, after a two-year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.  
 In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national banks and certain
other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines are effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be in compliance by January 1, 2018.  
 In May 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that would impose contractual requirements on certain  qualified financial
contracts  ( covered QFCs ) to which U.S. G-SIBs, including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. In August 2016, the OCC proposed a rule that would subject national banks that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, including our U.S.
Bank Subsidiaries, as well as certain other institutions (collectively with U.S. G-SIBs and their other subsidiaries,  covered entities ), to substantively identical requirements. Under the proposals, covered QFCs must expressly provide
that transfer restrictions and default rights against a covered entity are limited to the same extent as provided under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, covered
QFCs may not permit the exercise of cross-default rights against a covered entity based on an affiliate s entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of

Management s Discussion and Analysis   

the first calendar quarter that begins at least one year after the final rules are issued. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposals, which are subject to public comment and
further rulemaking procedures.    For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these
areas, see  Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company Resolution and Recovery Planning  in Part I, Item 1 of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
   Single-Counterparty Credit Limits    
 In March 2016, the Federal Reserve re-proposed rules that would establish single-counterparty credit limits for large banking organizations
( covered companies ), with more stringent limits for the largest covered companies. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, would be subject to a limit of 15% of Tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any  major counterparty  (defined as
other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and nonbank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve) and to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. We continue to
evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules.      Compensation Practices    
 In the second quarter of 2016, the federal regulatory agencies required under the Dodd-Frank Act to issue regulations relating to the
compensation practices of covered financial institutions, including us, re-proposed rules that if implemented would require, among other things, the deferral of a percentage of certain incentive-based compensation for senior executives and certain
other employees and, under certain circumstances,  clawback  of incentive-based compensation. We continue to evaluate the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures. 
   Legacy Covered Funds under the Volcker Rule    
 The Volcker Rule prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities, such as us, with  covered funds,  with a
number of exemptions and exclusions. The Federal Reserve has extended the conformance period until July 21, 2017 for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place before December 31, 2013, referred to as  legacy
covered funds.  On July 7, 2016, the Federal Reserve stated that it will continue to consider whether to take action regarding the additional extended five-year transition period for certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds and
that it expects to provide more information in the near term as to how it will address applications by banking entities seeking the statutory extension for this limited category of legacy covered funds. We currently have approximately $2.2 billion
of non-conforming investments in,

and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of the investments, we also continue to
consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule, including sales, redemptions, and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these investments may be less than their current carrying values.  
   U.S. Department of the Treasury Regulations    
 On October 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final and temporary regulations under Section 385 of the U.S. tax code
addressing, among other things, the treatment of certain related-party indebtedness as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The regulations include multiple effective dates, the earliest of which is effective from January 19, 2017 and
applies to certain financial instruments issued after April 4, 2016. Although we are continuing to evaluate the regulations, we do not expect them to have a material effective tax rate impact.  
   Commodities and Merchant Banking Activities    
 In September 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rulemaking that would increase risk-based capital requirements for certain
commodities-related activities and commodities-related merchant banking investments of U.S. financial holding companies ( FHCs ), including us; impose new limitations on the physical commodity trading activities of certain U.S. FHCs; and
enhance reporting requirements with respect to U.S. FHCs  commodities-related activities and investments. If adopted in its current form, the proposed rulemaking would result in increases in our RWAs with respect to certain commodities-related
investments and physical commodity holdings. However, we expect that the proposed rule, if finalized in its proposed form, would not have a significant impact on our aggregate RWAs or risk-based capital ratios.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We enter
into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purpose entities ( SPEs ) and lending-related financial instruments ( e.g. , guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the
Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.    We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization
activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1.    For

 On June 23, 2016, the U.K. electorate voted to leave the European Union (the  EU ). It is difficult to predict the future of the
U.K. s relationship with the EU, which uncertainty may increase the volatility in the global financial markets in the short- and medium-term. There are several alternative models of relationship that the U.K. might seek to negotiate with the
EU, the timeframe for which is uncertain but could take two years or more. The regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions with significant operations in Europe, such as us, is expected to evolve and specific and meaningful information
regarding the long-term consequences of the vote is expected to become clearer over time. We will continue to evaluate various courses of action in the context of the development of the U.K. s withdrawal from the EU and the referendum s
potential impact on our operations. For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk Country Risk Exposure  in Part

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
    
   Risk Management  
 Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. For a discussion of our risk management
functions, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Market Risk     Market risk refers to the
risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will
result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of
our Value-at-Risk ( VaR ) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur trading-related market risk within the Wealth Management business segment. The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments incur
non-trading interest rate risk primarily from lending and deposit taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from investments in private equity and real estate funds. For a further
discussion of market risk, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Market Risk  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
   VaR     We use the statistical
technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management.
    VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations.  For information regarding our VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Market Risk Sales and Trading and Related Activities VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K.
   We utilize the same VaR model for risk management purposes as well as for regulatory capital calculations as approved by our regulators.

The portfolio of positions used for our VaR for risk management purposes ( Management
VaR ) differs from that used for regulatory capital requirements ( Regulatory VaR ). Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR. Examples include counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustments
( CVA ) and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.    The following table presents
the Management VaR for the Trading portfolio, on a period-end, quarterly average and quarterly high and low basis. To further enhance the transparency of the traded market risk, the Credit Portfolio VaR has been disclosed as a separate category from
the Primary Risk Categories.     Trading Risks      95%/One-Day
Management VaR       
     
   N/A Not Applicable  

1. 
   Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This
benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.     

2. 
   The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different
days during the quarter, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.

Risk Disclosures   

The average Total Management VaR for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 ( current
quarter ) was $42 million, which was reduced from $46 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 ( last quarter ).    The
average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories for the current quarter was $32 million compared with $38 million for the last quarter. The decrease was driven by an overall reduction in risk exposures across the Sales and Trading
businesses.     Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for the Current Quarter.     One method of
evaluating the reasonableness of our VaR model as a measure of our potential volatility of net revenues is to compare VaR with actual trading revenues. Assuming no intraday trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR, the expected number of times that trading
losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model would be questioned. We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the
potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the
VaR model s accuracy relative to realized trading results.    The distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues is presented in the
following histograms for the Total Trading populations.     Total Trading.     As shown in the 95%/One-Day
Management VaR table, the average 95%/one-day Total Management VaR for the current quarter was $42 million. The following histogram presents the distribution of the daily 95%/one-day Total Management VaR for the current quarter, which was in a range
between $35 million and $45 million for approximately 95% of trading days during the quarter.          

The following histogram shows the distribution for the current quarter of daily net trading
revenues, including profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities, for our Trading businesses. Daily net trading revenues
also include intraday trading activities but exclude certain items not captured in the VaR model, such as fees, commissions and net interest income. Daily net trading revenues differ from the definition of revenues required for Regulatory VaR
backtesting, which further excludes intraday trading. During the current quarter, we experienced net trading losses on 1 day, which was not in excess of the 95%/one-day Total Management VaR.  

Non-trading Risks    
 We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. Reflected below is this analysis covering
substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.     Counterparty Exposure Related to Our Own Credit
Spread.     The credit spread risk sensitivity of the counterparty exposure related to our own credit spread corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $7 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread
level at both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.     Funding Liabilities.     The credit spread risk sensitivity
of our mark-to-market funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $17 million and $15 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
  Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity.     The following table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and
downward parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our U.S. Bank

Table of Contents  

Risk Disclosures   

Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity, including our deposit deployment strategy and asset-liability management hedges.  
  U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis       
   At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, large instantaneous interest rates shocks had a negative impact to
our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  projected net interest income over the following 12 months due to composition of the banks  assets as well as expected deposit pricing behavior at higher levels of interest rates. We do not manage to any single
rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios and does not assume any change
in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates.     Investments.     We have
exposure to public and private companies through direct investments as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which are for business
facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance fees.  
  Investments Sensitivity, Including Related Performance Fees       
    Equity Market Sensitivity.     In the Wealth Management and Investment Management
business segments, certain fee-based revenue streams are driven by the value of clients  equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the
level and duration of the equity market decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and

redemptions, and the impact of such market decline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets.  
  Credit Risk     Credit risk refers to the
risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We primarily incur credit risk exposure to institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business
segments. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K. Also, see Notes 7 and 11 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information about our loans and lending commitments, respectively.      Lending Activities
     We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net
worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. In the consolidated balance sheets, these loans and lending commitments are carried at either fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings; held for investment,
which are recorded at amortized cost; or held for sale, which are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Loans held for investment and loans held for sale are classified in Loans, and loans held at fair value are classified in Trading assets in
the consolidated balance sheets. See Notes 3, 7 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further information.

   Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for all
lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.     

3. 
   For syndications led by us, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts
agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. For syndications that we participate in and do not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that we expect will be allocated
from the lead, syndicate bank. Due to the nature of our obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.

Our credit exposure from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our
internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower s financial strength, seniority of the loan, collateral type, volatility of collateral value,
debt cushion, loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio, covenants and counterparty type. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms and volume and severity of
past due loans may also be considered. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses related to loans that were accounted for as held for investment was $287 million and $225 million, respectively, and the allowance for
commitment losses related to lending commitments that were accounted for as held for investment was $187 million and $185 million, respectively. The aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses increased over the nine months ended September
30, 2016 primarily due to specific reserves on exposures to counterparties in the energy sector and other select downgrades. See  Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy Industry  herein and Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further information.     Institutional Securities Lending
Activities   .              In connection with certain of our Institutional Securities business segment activities, we provide loans and lending commitments to a diverse group of corporate and
other institutional clients. These activities include corporate lending, commercial and residential mortgage lending, asset-backed lending, corporate loans purchased in the secondary market, financing extended to equities and commodities customers,
and loans to municipalities. These loans and lending commitments may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to
the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by us.    Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments are mainly related to
relationship-based and event-driven lending to select corporate clients. Relationship-based loans and lending commitments are used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity purposes by our Investment Banking clients and typically
consist of revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and term loans. In connection with the relationship-based lending activities, we had hedges (which included single-name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $18.0
billion and $12.0 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization
and project finance activities. Event-driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans.

are accounted for as either held for sale or at fair value. Additionally, approximately 56% of the total energy industry loans and lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. At September 30, 2016, the energy industry portfolio
included $1.6 billion in loans and $2.0 billion in lending commitments to Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ( E P ) companies. The E P lending commitments were primarily to investment grade counterparties. The E P loans
were to non-investment grade counterparties, which are generally subject to periodic borrowing base reassessments based on the value of

Risk Disclosures   

the underlying oil and gas reserves pledged as collateral. In limited situations, we may extend the period related to borrowing base reassessments typically in conjunction with taking certain
risk mitigating actions with the borrower. Over the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased the allowance for loan and commitment losses on held for investment energy exposures and incurred mark-to-market losses on fair value energy
loans. See  Credit Risk Lending Activities  herein for further information. To the extent commodities prices, or oil prices, remain at quarter-end levels, or deteriorate further, we may incur additional lending losses.  
 At December 31, 2015, Institutional Securities  loans and lending commitments related to the energy industry were $15.9 billion.
Approximately 60% of these energy industry loans and lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. At December 31, 2015, the energy industry portfolio included $1.7 billion in loans and $2.7 billion in lending commitments to E P
companies. The E P loans were substantially all to non-investment grade counterparties which are subject to semi-annual borrowing base reassessments based on the value of the underlying oil and gas reserves pledged as collateral. The E P
lending commitments were primarily to investment grade counterparties.     Institutional Securities Margin
Lending.     In addition to the activities noted above, Institutional Securities provides margin lending, which allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin lending were $15.2 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.  
  Wealth Management Lending Activities.     The principal Wealth Management lending activities include
securities-based lending and residential real estate loans.    Securities-based lending provided to our retail clients is primarily
conducted through our Portfolio Loan Account ( PLA ) and Liquidity Access Line ( LAL ) platforms which had an outstanding loan balance of $29.1 billion and $24.9 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
For more information about our securities-based lending and residential real estate loans, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk Lending Activities  in Part II, Item 7A
of the 2015 Form 10-K.    For the current quarter, loans and lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment
lending activities increased by approximately 7.5%, mainly due to growth in LAL and residential real estate loans.

Wealth Management Lending Activities by Remaining Contractual Maturity   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 99.9% of the Wealth Management business segment
loans held for investment were current, while approximately 0.1% were on nonaccrual status because the loans were past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest was in doubt.  
 The Wealth Management business segment also provides margin lending to clients and had an outstanding balance of $12.8 billion and $14.7
billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.  
 In addition, the Wealth Management business segment has employee loans that are granted primarily in conjunction with programs established by
us to retain and recruit certain employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are full recourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to
12 years. We establish an allowance for loan amounts we do not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense.     Credit
Exposure Derivatives     We incur credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments
arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of  

Table of Contents  

Risk Disclosures   

the contract. In connection with our OTC derivative activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with
the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master netting agreement in the event of counterparty default. We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of
risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative
products ( e.g. , futures, forwards, swaps and options). For credit exposure information on our OTC derivative products, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1. For a discussion of our credit exposure to derivative
contracts, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk Credit Exposure Derivatives  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Credit Derivative Portfolio by Counterparty Type       

1. 
   Our credit default swaps ( CDS ) are classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Approximately 4% and 3% of receivable fair values and 9% and 6% of payable fair values represented Level 3 amounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1).

The fair values shown in the previous table are before the application of contractual netting or
collateral. For additional credit exposure information on our credit derivative portfolio, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1.     OTC
Derivative Products at Fair Value, Net of Collateral, by Industry       

1. 
   Industry categories are based on the Global Industry Classification Standard   .     

2. 
   Amounts include mutual funds, pension funds, private equity and real estate funds, exchanges and clearinghouses, and
diversified financial services.     

3. 
   For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in Item 1.        Other   
 In addition to the activities noted above, there are other credit risks managed by the Credit Risk Management Department and various business
areas within the Institutional Securities business segment. We participate in securitization activities whereby we extend short-term or long-term funding to clients through loans and lending commitments that are secured by the assets of the borrower
and generally provide for over-collateralization, including commercial real estate loans, loans secured by loan pools, commercial company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments
arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement or a decline in the underlying collateral value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for information about our securitization
activities. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the

Risk Disclosures   

collateral function. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information about our collateralized transactions.  
  Country Risk Exposure    Country risk
exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit
and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. Country risk exposure before and after hedging is monitored and managed. For a further discussion of our country risk exposure see,  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Country Risk Exposure  in Part II, Item 7A of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
 Our sovereign exposures consist of financial instruments entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures
consist of exposures to primarily corporations and financial institutions. The following table shows our 10 largest non-U.S. country risk net exposures at September 30, 2016. Index credit derivatives are included in the country risk exposure table.
Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the
index, adjusted for any fair value receivable/payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a
different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure column based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable/payable is reflected in
the Net Inventory column based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

Risk Disclosures   

Top Ten Country Exposures at September 30, 2016   

1. 
   Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions ( i.e. , bonds and
equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable). As a market maker, we may transact in these CDS positions to facilitate client trading. At September 30, 2016, gross
purchased protection, gross written protection, and net exposures related to single-name and index credit derivatives for those countries were $(117.0) billion, $115.0 billion and $(1.9) billion, respectively. For a further description of the
triggers for purchased credit protection and whether those triggers may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see  Credit Exposure Derivatives  herein.     

2. 
   Net counterparty exposure ( i.e ., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) takes into
consideration legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.     

3. 
   At September 30, 2016, the benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure was $13.6 billion in
Germany, with 99% of collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of France, Belgium and Germany, and $10.7 billion in the U.K. with 97% of collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.K., the U.S. and Italy. The
benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure in the other countries totaled approximately $19.6 billion, with collateral primarily consisting of cash and government obligations of Japan and France. These amounts do not include
collateral received on secured financing transactions.     

4. 
   Amounts represent CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks
responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures for us. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable.     

5. 
   In addition, at September 30, 2016, we had exposure to these countries for overnight deposits with banks of
approximately $9.1 billion.

Risk Disclosures   

Country Risk Exposure Related to the United Kingdom.     At September
30, 2016, our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $17,956 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits of $3,368 million. The $17,705 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were
diversified across both names and sectors. Of this exposure, $15,201 million is to investment grade counterparties, with the largest single component ($4,702 million) to exchanges and clearing houses. 
  Country Risk Exposure Related to Brazil .    At September 30, 2016, our country risk exposures in Brazil included
net exposures of $5,504 million (shown in the previous table). Our sovereign net exposures in Brazil were principally in the form of local currency government bonds held onshore to support client activity. The $654 million (shown in the previous
table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors.     Country Risk Exposure Related to
China.       At September 30, 2016, our country risk exposures in China included net exposures of $2,106 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits with international banks of $303 million. The $2,221
million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors and were primarily concentrated in high-quality positions with negligible direct exposure to onshore equities. 
  Operational Risk     Operational risk
refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical
assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities ( e.g ., sales and trading) and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and trade
processing). On March 4, 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision updated its proposal for calculating operational risk regulatory capital. Under the proposal, which would eliminate the use of an internal model-based approach, required
levels

of operational risk regulatory capital would generally be determined under a standardized approach based primarily on a financial statement-based measure of operational risk exposure and
adjustments based on the particular institution s historic operational loss record. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures. For a further discussion about our
operational risk, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Operational Risk  in Part II, Item 7A, of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Liquidity and Funding Risk     Liquidity
and funding risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating its assets. Liquidity and funding risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived
ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity and funding risk, see
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Liquidity and Funding Risk  in Part II, Item 7A, of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Legal and Compliance Risk     Legal and
compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws,
regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty s performance
obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules and regulations. For a further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk Risk Management Legal and Compliance Risk  in Part II, Item 7A, of the 2015 Form 10-K.
