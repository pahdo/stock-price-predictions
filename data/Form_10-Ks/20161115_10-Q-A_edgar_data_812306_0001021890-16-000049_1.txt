      disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                           our supervision, to ensure that material information
      relating to the registrant, including
         its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
      those entities, particularly
      during the period in which this report is being

principles;  

(c)  
      Evaluated the effectiveness of
                                     the registrant's disclosure controls and

likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and
