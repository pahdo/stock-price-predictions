  Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements  

  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1          NATURE
OF ORGANIZATION  

Rich Cigars, Inc. (the
 Company ) is a Florida Corporation incorporated on July 29, 2013,
and was established to manufacture and distribute high-quality, hand rolled,
premium cigars under the Rich Cigars brand name.  The Company has branded custom
cigars to be sold via the internet and through retail locations.  The Company's
primary operations are currently in the Ocala, Florida area, and management
intends to conduct our business principally in the U.S. through our own sales
and marketing team. 

NOTE 2          RECLASSIFICATION OF PRIOR YEAR
PRESENTATION   

 Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period
presentation. Additionally, certain expense items
have been broken out differently. 
Previously, the Company had netted its stock subscription receivables
against common stock. In the current period the Company concluded that it was
more appropriate to present these subscription receivables separately in the
Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Shareholders' Equity.  These
reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. This change in classification does not
materially affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from
financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows, and had no effect on the
previously reported Statement of Operations for any period.    

  NOTE 3         GOING
CONCERN  

These financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the
foreseeable future.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred
net losses of $436,117 since inception. This raises substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management's plans include raising capital
through the equity markets to fund operations and eventually, the generating of
revenue through its business; however, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in such activities.  These financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets
or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.    

  NOTE 4          SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                  

   Basis of Presentation   

 The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying unaudited
interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and with the rules
and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission set
forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion
of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim
periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of
the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Condensed Financial Statements  

  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

   (Unaudited)  

Use of Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make
estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. 
The significant accounting policies, estimates and related judgments underlying
the Company's financial statements are summarized below.  In applying
these policies, management makes subjective judgments that frequently require
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. 

Earnings per
Share   

 The Company has adopted ASC
260-10-50,  Earnings per Share,  which provides for the
calculation of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income
or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential
dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.  Basic
and diluted losses per share were the same at the reporting dates as no common
stock equivalents were issued or outstanding during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

  NOTE 5          EQUITY  

In August 2016, the
Company issued approximately 125,080 shares of the Company's common stock for $12,508.  Additionally, in September 2016 the
company issued 20,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $2,000.  In
September 2016, the Company issued approximately 112,500 shares of common stock
in exchange for consulting services performed.  The company recorded Professional
Fees expense associated with the stock issuance of approximately $11,250. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company's CEO contributed
$201,391 in the business to be used in the Company's regular activities.  As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has used these proceeds on the Company's
operations and purchases 

NOTE 6          COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

During the normal course of business, the
Company may be exposed to litigation.  When the Company becomes aware of
potential litigation, it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance with
ASC 450-20-50,  Contingencies.   The Company evaluates its
exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome.  If the Company determines that an
unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes
the necessary accruals.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company is not
aware of any contingent liabilities that should be reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. 

NOTE 7          SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

The Company has evaluated
subsequent events that occurred through the date of the filing of the Company's
third quarter of fiscal year 2016 Form 10-Q. As of October 5, 2016, the
Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares
authorized for issuance to one billion shares (1,000,000,000).  Additionally,
the Board declared a five for one stock split of the Company's outstanding
common stock.  After the stock split is effective, the total number of shares
issued and outstanding is approximately 2,612,980. This transaction has been
retroactively applied to all periods presented in the financial statements. 
Other than this transaction, no significant event occurred subsequent to the
balance sheet date and prior to the filing date of this report that would have
a material impact on the Financial Statements.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.  

   Forward-Looking
Statements and Associated Risks.   

  This form 10-Q contains certain statements that are
forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. For this purpose any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that
are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking
statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as  may ,
 will ,  expect ,  believe ,
 anticipate ,  estimate, or  continue  or comparable
terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and
actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of
which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to
economic conditions generally and in the industries in which we may
participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from
much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully
develop business relationships.  

   Going Concern   

 Based on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2016,
we had an accumulated deficit totaling $(436,117). This raises substantial
doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

   Plan of Operation   

 The Company was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 29, 2013. The
Company was established to manufacture and distribute high-quality, hand rolled, premium
cigars under the Rich Cigars brand name. The Company has branded custom cigars
to be sold via the internet and through retail locations. The Company's primary
operations are currently in the Ocala, Florida area, and management intends to
conduct our business principally in the U.S. through our own sales and
marketing team. 

Results of Operations   

  Three Months  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had $1,213 in revenues
and $507 in cost of goods sold compared to $Nil for the same period one year
earlier. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating
expenses were $64,930 as compared to $17,474 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Some of the categories with larger differences in expenses are
discussed here. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred
expenses of $35,067 for professional fees compared to $6,305 for the same
period in 2015. The increase in professional fees is largely due to our effort
to become listed on the OTC Pink Market, and the fact that we are now a
reporting public company. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we
incurred expenses of $15,191 for officers' compensation compared to $0 for the
same period in 2015. The increase is due to additional compensation to the
Company's CEO for attending events and marketing the business.  For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred travel expenses in the amount of $9,137
compared to $3,015 for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in travel is
due to Company sponsoring events to increase brand awareness and market product.
For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $2,009 for other general and
administrative expenses, which was down from $4,406 for the same period in
2015. The decrease is due to a decrease in marketing expense for the business. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred meals and entertainment expenses
of $2,053 compared to $3,262 for the corresponding period in 2015.  The
decrease in this category is due to reduced spending on meals and entertainment
during sponsoring events.   

  Nine Months  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had
$4,184 in revenues and $1,428 in cost of goods sold compared to $Nil for the
same period one year earlier. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, our
total operating expenses were $130,465 as compared to $57,351 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Some of the categories with larger differences
in expenses are discussed here. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
incurred expenses of $43,899 for officers' compensation compared to $0 for the
same period in 2015. The increase is due to additional compensation to the
Company's CEO for attending events and marketing the business.   For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred professional fees in the amount
of $45,739 compared to $16,269 for the corresponding period in 2015.  The
increase in this category is due to additional fees incurred after the company's
public offering. These increased  
 -9-  

expenses were partially offset by lower expenses in
the following categories. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
incurred $21,237 for travel expenses compared to $28,235 for the same period in
2015 which is due to a decrease in travel for events and conferences. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred meals and entertainment
expenses of $2,695 compared to $5,516 for the corresponding period in 2015 which
is due to reduced spend on meals during travel and sponsorship events.  

 Our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to whether we will be able
to continue to operate as a  going concern  due to the fact that the Company
has an accumulated deficit of $(436,117) as of September 30, 2016, compared to
an accumulated deficit of $(308,408) at December 31, 2015, and has not yet
established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating
costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining the
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease
operations. 

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 As at September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $6,753 as compared to $7,056
at December 31, 2015. Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the
next twelve months is through the sale of shares of our common stock, third
party financing, and/or traditional bank financing. We do not anticipate
generating sufficient amounts of revenues to meet our working capital
requirements. Consequently, we intend to make appropriate plans to insure
sources of additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion
through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities. 

 The Company must raise additional funds in order to fund our continued
operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds
or achieve profitable operations. Even if we are able to raise additional funds
through the sale of our securities or through the issuance of debt securities,
or loans from our directors or financial institutions our cash needs could be
greater than anticipated in which case we could be forced to raise additional
capital. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional
financing, and there can be no assurance that, if needed, additional capital
will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. These
conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital
when needed. If we cannot get the needed capital, we may not be able to become
profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations. 

  Operating Activities  

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company used cash in the amount of $112,391 in operating activities, which
is an increase of $54,753 over the same period in 2015. The increase in the
operating expenses of $73,114 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over
the corresponding period in 2015, is the main factor in the increased cash
used; however, there were positive adjustments made in the depreciation and
amortization, and shares issued for services categories, and there was a
positive change in the accounts payable and accrued expenses categories, which
help to offset the increased spending. The increased operating expenses are due
to the Company's effort to produce and sell its product, and its effort to
publicly list the Company. 

  Financing Activities  

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the Company received $14,508
from subscription agreements or private placement offerings. The Company also
received shareholder contributions in the amount of $97,580 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

 We intend to seek additional funding through public or private financings
to fund our operations through fiscal 2017 and beyond. However, if we are
unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, or
achieve cash flow positive operations, we may have to significantly delay
product development and scale back operations both of which may affect our
ability to continue as a going concern. 

  Investing Activities  

 The Company had no investing activities for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under
this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the
SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Management has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our company's disclosure controls and procedures. Due
to the lack of personnel and outside directors, management acknowledges that
there are deficiencies in these controls and procedures.    

   Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting   

  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Additionally, the Board declared a five-for-one stock split of the Company's outstanding common stock.  After the stock split became effective, the total number of shares issued and outstanding was approximately 2,612,980. This transaction has been retroactively applied to all periods presented in the financial statements herein.  The stock split and corresponding amendments to its articles of incorporation were filed as a current report on Form 8-K on September 19, 2016.
