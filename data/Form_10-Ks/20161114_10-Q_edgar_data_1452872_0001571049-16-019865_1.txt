 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Note 1. Description of Business  

ARC
Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation  (the  Company ) , was incorporated in April 2000.
 The Company s business is focused on the development of the   Dick s Wings     
franchise and the acquisition of financial interests in other restaurant brands. The Dick s Wings concept is currently comprised
of traditional restaurants like its   Dick s Wings   Grill      restaurants
and non-traditional units like the Dick s Wings concession stands that the Company has at EverBank Field .
The Company establishes restaurants by entering into franchise agreements with qualified parties and  generates revenue by
granting franchisees the right to use the name  Dick s Wings  and offer the Dick s Wings product line in
exchange for royalty payments, franchise fees and area development fees. 

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had 24 restaurants  and two Dick s Wings concession stands. Of the 24 restaurants,
18 are located in Florida and six are located in Georgia. The Company s concession stands at EverBank Field are also located
in Florida. All of the Company s restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees, and the Company s concession stands
at EverBank Field is licensed to a third-party operator.  

Note 2. Basis of Presentation  

Interim Financial Information  

The accompanying unaudited
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X and the related rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the
opinion of management, the disclosures included in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. 

The unaudited financial
statements included in this report have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in management s
opinion, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that the Company will have for any subsequent quarter or full fiscal year. 

Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

ARC Group, Inc.  

 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Reclassifications  

Certain amounts in the
Company s financial statements for 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications
did not result in any change to the previously reported total assets, net income or stockholders  equity. 

Going Concern    

As
shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had working capital deficits of $852,870 and $975,117 at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the Company s accumulated deficit was $4,053,680. During
the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014, the Company generated negative cash flows from operating activities. Those
facts create an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon it successfully executing its plans to generate positive
cash flows during fiscal year 2016. The Company's financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if
it were unable to continue as a going concern.  

Significant Accounting Policies  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s significant accounting policies and estimates, and applicable recent accounting pronouncements,
which are detailed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, had not changed materially.  

Note 3. Net Income Per Share  

The Company calculates
basic and diluted net income per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic net income per share
is based on the weighted-average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the applicable period,
and is calculated by dividing the reported net income for the applicable period by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing the reported net income
for the applicable period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable period, as
adjusted to give effect to the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding at the end of the applicable
period. 

The Company did not have
any exercisable or convertible securities outstanding at September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. As a result, basic net income
per share was equal to diluted net income per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively.

Note 4. Investment in Paradise on Wings  

On January 20, 2014, the
Company entered into a contribution agreement with Paradise on Wings. In connection with the execution of the contribution agreement,
on January 20, 2014, the Company and the incumbent members of Paradise on Wings entered into an amended and restated operating
agreement of Paradise on Wings to reflect the terms of the contribution agreement. The transactions contemplated by the contribution
agreement and operating agreement were completed on January 20, 2014. 

Under the terms of the
contribution agreement, the Company (sometimes referred to herein as the  Class B Member ) acquired 117.65 Class B
membership interests in Paradise on Wings, representing all of the outstanding Class B membership interests and a 50% ownership
interest in Paradise on Wings (the  Class B Membership Interests ). The incumbent members of Paradise on Wings (the
 Class A Members ) converted their existing membership interests into a total of 117.65 Class A membership interests
in Paradise on Wings, representing all of the outstanding Class A membership interests and a 50% ownership interest in Paradise
on Wings (the  Class A Membership Interests ). 

The Company agreed to pay
$400,000 in cash, of which $350,000 was paid prior to closing and $50,000 was due upon closing, and $400,000 in shares of the Company s
common stock to Paradise on Wings in consideration for the Class B Membership Interests (the  Capital Contribution ).
The shares of common stock (the  ARC Shares ) were valued based upon the opening bid price of the common stock on the
OTCmarkets.com on the morning of the closing date, which was $1.70 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued 235,295 shares of
common stock to Paradise on Wings on the closing date. 

Under the operating agreement,
the power to manage the business and affairs of Paradise on Wings has been vested in the managers of Paradise on Wings. The Class
A Members may appoint up to two managers, which manager(s) have a total of 50% of the vote of all managers. The Company, as the
owner of all of the Class B Membership Interests, may appoint one manager who has a total of 50% of the vote of all managers. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Contributed Capital may not be used to pay salaries or bonuses to any of the Class A Members or Class B Members,
and the vote of 60% of the total outstanding Class A Membership Interests and Class B Membership Interests is required in the event
Paradise on Wings wishes to use the Contributed Capital for any permitted purpose. 

The Class A Membership
Interests are identical to the Class B Membership Interests in all respects except that the Class A Membership Interests have a
preferred right to distributions from Paradise on Wings with respect to the ARC Shares. The Class A Members, through their ownership
of the Class A Membership Interests, are entitled to receive a total of 50% of all items of income, gain, losses, deductions and
expenses (including 100% of any such items associated with the ARC Shares), and the Company, through its ownership of the Class
B Membership Interests, is entitled to receive 50% of all items of income, gain, losses, deductions and expenses (with the exception
of any such items associated with the ARC Shares). 

ARC Group, Inc.  

 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The
Company accounts for its 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings using the equity method of accounting because the
Company has the ability to exert significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of Paradise
on Wings.   The investment was initially recorded  at the fair value amount of the Company s initial investment
 and subsequently adjusted for the Company s share of the net income and loss, and cash
contributions and distributions, to or from Paradise on Wings.  The Company reported its income from Paradise on Wings as
income from investment in Paradise on Wings in its statements of operations, and reported its investment in Paradise on Wings as
equity investment in Paradise on Wings in its balance sheets.  

Set
forth below is a summary of the unaudited income statement of Paradise on Wings for the three- and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 provided to the Company by Paradise on Wings.  

Set
forth below is a summary of the unaudited balance sheet of Paradise on Wings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 provided
to the Company by Paradise on Wings.  

Note 5. Fair Value Measurements  

On
January 20, 2014, the Company purchased a 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings. A description of the investment in Paradise
on Wings is set forth herein under  Note 4. Investment in Paradise on Wings . 

The
following table presents the Company s equity investment in Paradise on Wings within the fair value hierarchy utilized to
measure fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

ARC Group, Inc.  

 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The
Company s other financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable. The estimated fair values of the cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
 accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other short-term liabilities  approximates their respective
carrying amounts due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair values of the notes receivable and
notes payable also approximates their respective carrying amounts since their terms are similar to those in the lending market
for comparable loans with comparable risks.  The fair value of related-party transactions is not determinable due to their
related-party nature.  None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.  

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies  

Employment   Consulting Agreements  

On
January 22, 2013, the Company appointed Richard W. Akam to serve as its Chief Operating Officer. In connection therewith, the Company
entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Akam pursuant to which it agreed to pay him an annual base salary of $150,000, subject
to annual adjustment and discretionary bonuses, plus certain standard and customary fringe benefits.  The initial term
of the employment agreement is for one year and automatically renews for additional one year terms until terminated by Mr. Akam
or the Company.  

The
employment agreement provides that, on July 22, 2013, the Company would grant Mr. Akam shares of its common stock equal in value
to $50,000 if Mr. Akam is continuously employed by the Company through that date. The number of shares of common stock that the
Company would issue to Mr. Akam would be calculated based on the last sales price of the Company s common stock as reported
on the OTC Bulletin Board on July 22, 2013.  The employment agreement also provides that the Company will grant Mr. Akam
additional shares of its common stock equal in value to $50,000 on January 1st of each year thereafter if Mr. Akam is continuously
employed by the Company through January 1st of the applicable year. The number of shares of common stock that the Company will
issue to Mr. Akam for each applicable year will be calculated based on the average of the last sales price of shares of the Company s
common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board for the month of January of the applicable year.   

Notwithstanding
the above, and in connection therewith, Mr. Akam agreed that the number of shares that may be earned by him under his employment
agreement in connection with any particular grant would be equal to the lesser of: (i) 71,429 shares of common stock, or (ii) the
number of shares of common stock calculated by dividing $50,000 by the closing price of the Company s common stock on the
day immediately preceding the date the Company s obligation to issue the shares to him fully accrues. Mr. Akam also agreed
that in the event the Company is unable to fulfill its obligation to issue all of the shares earned by him with respect to any
particular grant because it does not have enough shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance, (i) Mr. Akam will
not require the Company to issue more shares of common stock than are then authorized and available for issuance by the Company,
and (i) the Company may settle any liability to Mr. Akam created as a result thereof in cash. 

ARC Group, Inc.  

 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In
the event the Company terminates Mr. Akam s employment without  cause  (as such term is defined in the employment
agreement), Mr. Akam will be entitled to receive the following severance compensation from the Company: (i) if the Company terminates
Mr. Akam s employment during the first year of his employment with the Company, that amount of compensation equal to the
salary payable to Mr. Akam during that year, (ii) if the Company terminates Mr. Akam s employment during the second year
of his employment with the Company, that amount of compensation equal to nine months of the salary payable to Mr. Akam during that
year, (iii) if the Company terminates Mr. Akam s employment during the third year of his employment with the Company, that
amount of compensation equal to six months of the salary payable to Mr. Akam during that year, and (iv) if the Company terminates
Mr. Akam s employment after the third year of his employment with the Company, that amount of compensation equal to three
months of the salary payable to Mr. Akam during the year that such termination occurs. Mr. Akam will not be entitled to receive
any severance compensation from the Company if the Company terminates his employment for  cause  or as a result of
his disability, or if Mr. Akam resigns from his employment with the Company.  

The
employment agreement also contains customary provisions that provide that, during the term of Mr. Akam s employment with
the Company and for a period of one year thereafter, Mr. Akam is prohibited from disclosing confidential information of the Company,
soliciting Company employees and certain other persons, and competing with the Company. 

On July 31, 2013, the Company
appointed Richard Akam as its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. The Company and Mr. Akam did not
amend the employment agreement in connection with the above appointments, and Mr. Akam is not receiving any additional compensation
in connection with the above appointments. 

On August 19, 2013, the
Company appointed Daniel Slone as the Company s Chief Financial Officer. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Slone an annual base
salary of $1.00 in connection with his appointment. The Company did not enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Slone. In connection
therewith, on August 19, 2013, Richard Akam resigned as the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Akam retained his positions
as the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary. 

On each of January 1, 2015
and January 1, 2016, Mr. Akam earned 71,429 shares of common stock under the terms of his employment agreement with the Company.

of contract. In January 2010, the parties to each of the actions entered into a settlement agreement with respect to both actions
pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $250,000 in full settlement of the legal proceedings (the  2010 Settlement Agreement ).
In early 2010, Cala breached the terms of the 2010 Settlement Agreement, relieving the Company of any further obligations under
the agreement. The Company made total payments of $40,000 under the 2010 Settlement Agreement prior to the breach by Cala. Accordingly,
the remaining balance of $210,000 outstanding under the settlement agreement was reflected in settlement agreements payable at
December 31, 2015. 

In August 2016, the
Company entered into a full and final settlement and release agreement with Cala. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company and Cala agreed to release each other from all claims related to the ARC   Cala Proceedings, any and all other
lawsuits that may have been filed by one party against the other, the 2010 Settlement Agreement, and any other matters,
causes of action or claims either party may have had against the other. In consideration for the releases, the Company agreed
to pay $15,000 to Cala and issue 35,000 shares of its common stock to Cala. The Company recognized a non-cash gain on
settlement of liabilities of $175,449 in connection therewith during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016. The
remaining balance of $210,000 outstanding under the 2010 Settlement Agreement was debited to settlement agreements payable at
September 30, 2016.

beginning on page 1 of this report. 

Overview  

We were  formed
in April 2000 to develop  the  Dick s Wings  concept, and are the operator and franchisor
of the Dick s Wings brand of restaurants. We offer a variety of boldly-flavored menu items highlighted by our Buffalo, New
York-style chicken wings spun in our signature sauces and seasonings. We offer our customers a casual, family-fun restaurant environment
designed to appeal to both families and sports fans alike. At Dick s Wings, we strive to provide our customers with a unique
and enjoyable experience from first bite to last call. 

Our Dick s Wings
concept is comprised of traditional restaurants like our   Dick s Wings   Grill     
 restaurants , which are  full service restaurant s, and non-traditional
units like our two Dick s Wings concession stands that we have at EverBank Field .  We currently
have 24 full-service restaurants  and two Dick s Wings concession stands at EverBank Field. Of
our 24 restaurants, 18 are located in Florida and six are located in Georgia. Our concession stands at EverBank Field are also
located in Florida. All of our restaurants are owned by franchisees, and our concession stands at EverBank Field are licensed to
a third-party operator.   

Strategy  

Our plan is to grow our
company from a primarily Florida-based franchisor of Dick s Wings restaurants into a diversified restaurant company operating
a portfolio of premium restaurant brands. The first major component of our growth strategy is the continued improvement and expansion
of our legacy Dick s Wings brand. In furtherance of this, we plan to open franchised restaurants in both new and existing
markets in the U.S. In our existing markets, we plan to continue to open new franchise restaurants until a market is penetrated
to a point that will enable us to gain marketing, operational, cost and other efficiencies. In new markets, we plan to open several
restaurants at a time to quickly build our brand awareness. We currently plan to open several new Dick s Wings restaurants
in the U.S. during the next 12 months. 

The other major component
of our growth strategy is the acquisition of controlling and non-controlling financial interests in other restaurant brands offering
us product and geographic diversification. We plan to complete, and are actively seeking, potential mergers, acquisitions, joint
ventures and other strategic initiatives through which we can acquire or develop additional restaurant brands. In furtherance of
this strategy, in January 2014, we acquired a 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings Franchise Group, LLC, a Utah limited
liability company that is the franchisor of the Wing Nutz brand of restaurants ( Paradise on Wings ). A description
of our investment in Paradise on Wings is set forth herein under  Note 4   Investment in Paradise on Wings  in our financial
statements. 

Financial Results  

We
achieved  revenue of $791,407 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $717,369 for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of 10%. We generated net income of $245,939 for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $39,722 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Our
total assets increased $144,015 to $939,653 at September 30, 2016 from $795,638 at December 31, 2015, and our
stockholders  deficit decreased $302,922 to $93,157 at September 30, 2016 compared to $396,079 at December 31, 2015. We
generated cash flows from operating activities of $152,279 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to
cash used by operating activities of $21,050 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, an improvement of $173,329. 

Outlook  

We expect our revenue to
increase during the next 12 months as we continue to improve the operations of our existing Dick s Wings restaurants and
open new Dick s Wings restaurants, as we acquire interests in other restaurant brands, and as the economy continues to improve.
We expect net income to increase during the next 12 months as we generate additional revenue through our new and existing restaurants
and as we generate additional income through our 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event we complete additional acquisitions of controlling or non-controlling financial interests in other restaurant brands
through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, our financial results will include and reflect the
financial results of the target entities. Accordingly, the completion of any such transactions in the future may have a substantial
beneficial or negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Comparison of the Three-Month Periods Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

Revenue consists primarily
of royalty payments and franchise fees that we receive from our franchisees. Revenue decreased $65,772 to $183,591 for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016 from $249,363 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $65,722 was
due primarily to a decrease of $64,134 for royalties.  We expect our revenue to increase during the next
12 months as we continue to improve the operations of our existing Dick s Wings restaurants and open new Dick s Wings
restaurants, as we acquire additional interests in other restaurant brands, and as the economy continues to improve . 

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses consist
primarily of professional fees, employee compensation expense, and general and administrative expenses. 

Professional Fees .
Professional fees consist of fees paid to our independent accountants, lawyers, technology consultants and other professionals
and consultants. Professional fees increased $33,047 to $52,550 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $19,503
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $33,047 was due primarily to an increase of $29,305 for consulting
fees. We expect our professional fees to increase during the next 12 months as we incur increased legal, accounting, technology
and consulting fees in connection with the general expansion of our business and operations and our compliance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

Employee Compensation
Expense . Employee compensation expense consists of salaries, bonuses and other cash compensation, equity-based compensation
and employee benefits paid or granted to our executive officers and employees, and the related payroll taxes. Employee compensation
expense decreased $35,113 to $140,600 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $175,713 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $35,113 was due primarily to a decrease of $27,500 for bonuses. We expect employee compensation
expense to increase over the next 12 months as we hire additional executive officers and other employees in connection with the
growth and expansion of our business and operations. 

General and Administrative
Expenses .  General and administrative expenses consist of marketing and advertising expenses, bank
service charges, computer and internet expenses, dues and subscriptions, licenses and filing fees, insurance expenses, investor
relations expenses, shareholder meeting expenses, bad debt expense, office supplies, rent expense, repairs and maintenance expenses,
telephone expenses, travel expenses, utilities expenses and other miscellaneous general and administrative expenses.  General
and administrative expenses increased $235,769 to $268,559 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $32,790 for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $235,769 was due primarily to an increase of $273,763 for bad
debt expense, partially offset by decreases in other miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative
expenses to increase over the next 12 months as we incur increasing expenses for marketing and advertising, investor relations,
travel, rent, office supplies, insurance and other miscellaneous items associated with the general growth of our business and operations. 

Income From Investment in Paradise on Wings  

Income from investment
in Paradise on Wings consists of our share of the income from our 50% ownership interest in Paradise on Wings that we purchased
on January 20, 2014. We generated income on our investment of $101,056 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared
to income from our investment of $5,277 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $95,779 was due primarily
to an increase in the value of shares of our common stock held by Paradise on Wings associated with an increase in the trading
price of our shares of common stock on the  OTCQB m  arket
tier of the  pink sheets  maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc . (the  OTCQB ). A description
of our investment in Paradise on Wings is set forth under  Note 4. Investment in Paradise on Wings  in our financial statements.
We expect to recognize additional income, and may incur losses, from our investment in Paradise on Wings during the next 12 months.
The amount of such income and losses will fluctuate based on the financial results of Paradise on Wings. 

Gain on Settlement of Liabilities  

Gain on settlement of liabilities
consists of the gain that we realized upon entering into a settlement agreement with Guiseppe Cala with respect to several legal
proceedings that had been initiated between us and Mr. Cala and breaches of a settlement agreement entered into between us and
Mr. Cala in 2010. We recognized a gain on the settlement of liabilities of $175,449 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2016. We did not recognize any gain on the settlement of liabilities for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. A
description of the current settlement agreement, the 2010 settlement agreement and the legal proceedings is set forth under   Note
13. Judgments in Legal Proceedings   in our financial statements. We do not expect to generate any additional gain on
settlement of liabilities during the next 12 months. 

Net Income / (Loss)  

We generated a net loss
of $4,235 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $23,688 during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. The difference of $27,923 was due primarily to a decrease of $65,772 for revenue, and increases of $33,047
for professional fees and $235,769 for general and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by increases of $95,779 for
income from investment in Paradise on Wings and $175,449 for gain on the settlement of liabilities, and a decrease of $35,113 for
employee compensation expense. We expect net income to increase during the next 12 months as we continue to generate additional
revenue through our new and existing restaurants and as our operating expenses continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event we complete additional acquisitions of controlling or non-controlling financial interests
in other restaurant brands through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, our financial results
will include and reflect the financial results of the target entities. Accordingly, the completion of any such transactions in
the future may have a substantial beneficial or negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

September 30, 2015. The increase of $206,217 was due primarily to increases of $74,038 for revenue, $79,697 for income from investment
in Paradise on Wings, and $175,449 for gain on the settlement of liabilities, and decreases of $47,933 for professional fees and
$45,784 for employee compensation expense. This was partially offset by an increase of $228,305 for general and administrative
expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Since our inception, we
have funded our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities and the use of short- and long-term debt. 

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $152,279 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used by operating activities
of $21,050 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The difference of $173,329 was due primarily to increases of
$206,217 for net income, $271,590 for bad debt expense and $85,075 for settlement agreements payable. This was partially offset
by an increases of $175,449 for gain on the settlement of liabilities, $77,511 for notes receivable and $79,697 for equity investment
in Paradise on Wings. 

Net cash used by investing
activities was $149,952 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $131,880 during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $18,072 was due to an increase of $439,438 for issuance of notes receivable to related
parties, partially offset by an increase of $421,366 for repayments of notes receivable issued to related parties. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities was $162,580 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. We did not have any net cash flows from financing
activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The decrease of $162,580 was due primarily to decreases of $395,206
for proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to related parties and $170,000 for proceeds from stock subscriptions receivable,
partially offset by an increase of $398,626 for repayments of notes payable issued to related parties. 

Our primary sources of
capital since December 29, 2014 are set forth below. 

Between
December 29, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we borrowed $1,987,953 under our credit facility from Blue Victory Holdings. During the
year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid $1,991,373 under the credit facility. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, we did not
have any principal outstanding under the credit facility . A summary of the terms of our credit facility with Blue Victory
Holdings is set forth under  Note 8. Debt Obligations  in our financial statements. 

Between January 1, 2016
and June 30, 2016, we borrowed an additional $783,323 from Blue Victory Holdings under the credit facility, all of which was repaid
by us during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016,
we did not have any principal outstanding under the credit facility.  

To date, our capital needs
have been met primarily through  cash
generated by our operations, sales of our equity securities and the use of short- and long-term debt to fund our operations. More
recently, we have relied upon the $1 million revolving credit facility that we obtained through Blue Victory Holdings in September
2013 and the proceeds from the promissory note issued to us by Seenu G. Kasturi in connection with the $340,000 financing transaction
that we entered into with him in February 2014 to fund our operations and recent expansion efforts.  We have used the proceeds
from the sale of our equity securities and the issuance of short-and long-term debt to pay virtually all of the costs and expenses
that we have incurred to date. These costs and expenses have been comprised primarily of the professional fees, employee compensation
expenses, and general and administrative expenses discussed above. 

We
intend to rely primarily on cash generated by our operations and proceeds from our credit facility with Blue Victory Holdings to
fund our operations and expansion efforts, including  additional acquisitions of controlling and non-controlling financial
interests in other restaurant brands ,
during the next 12 months.  A summary of the material terms of our credit facility with Blue Victory Holdings is set forth
under  Note 8. Debt Obligations  in our financial statements. 

We
can provide no assurance that these sources of capital will be adequate to fund our operations and expansion efforts during the
next 12 months. If these sources of capital are not adequate, we will need to obtain additional capital through alternative sources
of financing. We may attempt to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities or the issuance of short- and long-term
debt.   If we raise additional funds by issuing shares of our common stock, our stockholders will
experience dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing securities exercisable or convertible into shares of our common stock,
our stockholders will experience dilution in the event the securities are exercised or converted, as the case may be, into shares
of our common stock.  Debt financing may involve
agreements containing covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt,
issuing equity securities, making capital expenditures for certain purposes or above a certain amount, or declaring dividends.
 In addition, any equity or debt securities that we issue may  have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those
of the shares of common stock held by our stockholders. 

We
have not made arrangements to obtain additional capital and can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available
in an amount or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our ability to obtain additional capital will be subject to a number of factors,
including market conditions and our operating performance. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any
proposed future financing transactions unattractive to us.  If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or if such
capital cannot be obtained on acceptable terms, we may not be able to pay our costs and expenses as they are incurred, take advantage
of future acquisition opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events, or otherwise execute upon our business
plan. This may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in the extreme case, cause us
to discontinue our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016,
we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, that had been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market
or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

As of September 30, 2016,
we carried out the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September
30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required
to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during our fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

In October 2009, we initiated
a legal proceeding entitled  American Restaurant Concepts, Inc. vs. Cala, et al  that was filed in in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division, in Duval County (the  ARC Proceeding ). In the complaint,
we alleged damages for trademark infringement. Also on that date, a legal proceeding entitled  Cala v. Rosenberger et al. 
was filed with the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Duval County, Florida (the  Cala Proceeding  together
with the ARC Proceeding, the  ARC   Cala Proceedings ). In the complaint, Guiseppe Cala ( Cala ) alleged
damages for breach of contract. In January 2010, the parties to each of the actions entered into a settlement agreement with respect
to both actions pursuant to which we agreed to pay $250,000 in full settlement of the legal proceedings (the  2010 Settlement
Agreement ). In early 2010, Cala breached the terms of the 2010 Settlement Agreement, relieving us of any further obligations
under the agreement. 

In August 2016, we entered
into a full and final settlement and release agreement with Cala. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed to release
each other from all claims related to the ARC   Cala Proceedings, any and all other lawsuits that may have been filed by one
party against the other, the 2010 Settlement Agreement, and any other matters, causes of action or claims either party may have
had against the other. In consideration for the releases, we agreed to pay $15,000 to Cala and issue 35,000 shares of our common
stock to Cala. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.  

In August 2016, we issued
35,000 shares of our common stock to Cala pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement that we entered into with Cala. The securities
were issued to an accredited investor in a private placement transaction that was exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act directly by us without engaging in any advertising
or general solicitation of any kind and without payment of underwriting discounts or commissions to any person. The terms of the
settlement agreement are described herein under  Part II   Item 1. Legal Proceedings  and in  Note 13. Judgments in
Legal Proceedings  in our financial statements.
