  Note 1.  Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  American DG Energy Inc., or the Company, we, our or us, distributes, owns, operates and maintains clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat and cooling. The Company's business model is to own the equipment that it installs at customers' facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to its customers on a long-term contractual basis at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates. The Company calls this business the American DG Energy  On-Site Utility . 
    
  The Company has experienced total net losses since inception of approximately   $39 million  . For the foreseeable future, the Company expects to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as its management executes the current business plan. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash and cash equivalents and future cash flow from operations, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future, including the next twelve months. However, as the Company continues to grow its business by adding more energy systems, cash requirements will increase, and the Company may need to raise additional capital through debt financings or equity offerings to meet its operating and capital needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in its fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  
    
  In 2015, the Company began executing the "Initiative". The Initiative is focused on effectively investing the Company s capital by increasing the performance of its existing sites. The goal of the Initiative is to make strategic capital improvements aimed at increasing productivity of the existing portfolio while optimizing the Company s margins and increasing cash flow. The Company expects that the Initiative will provide a strong foundation of high performing assets that may be used to fund future growth. 
    
  On May 4, 2016, the Company exchanged approximately   14.72 million   of its shares in EuroSite Power, or   46%   of its   48%   ownership in its former European subsidiary, for elimination of a portion of the outstanding   6%   convertible debentures due May 2018 (see Note 5 "Convertible Debentures"). This partial extinguishment of debt reduced the Company's convertible debt outstanding to   $8.6 million  , net of the associated discount. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company exchanged   15.2 million   of its shares in EuroSite Power, or   90%   of its   20.5%   ownership in its former European subsidiary, for a further elimination of a portion of the outstanding   6%   convertible debentures due May 2018 (see Note 5. "Convertible debentures"). This partial extinguishment of debt reduced the Company's convertible debt outstanding to   $3.0 million  , net of the associated discount.  
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in American DG Energy Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  There have been no significant changes in accounting principles, practices or methods for making estimates.  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Those entities include the Company's   51.0%   owned joint venture, American DG New York, LLC, or ADGNY.

     Table of Contents  
  AMERICAN DG ENERGY INC. 

Investments in partnerships and companies in which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest but where we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. 
    
  The Company s operations are comprised of   one   business segment. The Company s business is selling energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling to its customers under long-term sales agreements.     
    
  Reclassification 
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. 

Note 2.  Income (Loss) Per Common Share               
       
  The Company computes basic income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company computes diluted earnings per common share using the treasury stock method. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Company considers its shares issuable in connection with convertible debentures, stock options and warrants to be dilutive common stock equivalents when the exercise price is less than the average market price of its common stock for the period. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company excluded   7,029,498   potentially dilutive shares because such shares would be anti-dilutive. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company excluded   15,192,083   potentially dilutive shares because such shares would be anti-dilutive as a result of the reported net loss. 

Note 3.  Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   differ from that which would be expected by applying the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to losses and nontaxable income for which no benefit is recognized. 

Note 4. Investment in EuroSite Power and Discontinued Operations 
  During the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company settled approximately   $16 million   of the   $19.4 million   of its   6%   convertible debentures due May 2018 (see Note 5 Convertible Debentures) by transferring ownership of shares it owned of EuroSite Power Inc to the holders of the debt. As a result, the Company's ownership in EuroSite decreased from   48.04%   to   2.03%  . Prior to the foregoing exchanges, the Company consolidated the results of EuroSite under the variable interest model as it was determined to be the primary beneficiary of EuroSite. 
  The exchanges were undertaken primarily as a plan to reduce future debt service requirements of the Company, however they also resulted in a disposition of all foreign operations of the Company, representing a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, amounts related to this component have been reported in discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  As of June 30, 2016, the Company owned a   20.5%   interest in the common stock of EuroSite Power which it accounted for using the equity method. Prior to June 28, 2016, the Company accounted for its investment in EuroSite Power as a consolidated subsidiary as it determined it was the primary beneficiary of EuroSite under the variable interest model. That determination included consideration of an implicit variable interest held by the Company in the form of a guarantee of the long-term convertible indebtedness of EuroSite Power. On June 28, 2016, substantially all of that convertible indebtedness was converted by the holders into shares of EuroSite Power, rendering the Company s guarantee inconsequential in the determination. As a result, the Company concluded it no longer held a variable interest in EuroSite Power. The Company deconsolidated EuroSite Power in its consolidated financial statements. This required recording the remaining shares held at fair value as an equity method investment, which resulted in a gain of approximately   $3.9 million  . The Company utilized a market approach in determining the fair value of the shares retained which incorporated the quoted market price of the shares at the date of deconsolidation and a blockage discount. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned a   2.03%   interest in the common stock of EuroSite Power. As such, the equity method of accounting is no longer appropriate in that the ability to exercise significant influence over EuroSite no longer exists at this level of ownership. The investment, as of September 30, 2016 is accounted for as an available-for-sale security (see Note 8 Fair Value Measurements).

The following is a reconciliation of the major line items comprising loss from discontinued operations: 

The total operating and investing cash flows of the discontinued operation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Note 5. Convertible Debentures 
  On May 4, 2016, the Company settled   $9.3 million   of its   $19.4 million   outstanding   6%   convertible debentures due May 2018 ( convertible debentures  or  debt ) by transferring ownership of approximately   14.72 million   shares it owned of EuroSite Power to the holders of the debt.   
  As the shares used to extinguish the debt are considered nonmonetary assets, the overall gain realized of approximately   $7.2 million   is composed of two elements: (1) the gain resulting from the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the shares transferred, of approximately   $7.7 million   and (2) the loss from the debt extinguishment of approximately   $500,000  . 
  As the Company retained its controlling financial interest in EuroSite Power following the transaction,   no   gain was recognized on the transaction, rather the gain was credited to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC 810-10-45-23. 
  On September 30, 2016, the Company settled   $6.7 million   of its   $10.1 million   outstanding   6%   convertible debentures due May 2018 by transferring ownership of   15.2 million   shares it owned of EuroSite Power in exchange for the debt. A new note evidencing the remaining balance of the debt outstanding of   $3,418,681   was issued, replacing the previous note. Interest on the debt was previously prepaid through maturity and the prepayment is reflected as a discount against the debt which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. (see Note 4 Investment in EuroSite Power and Discontinued Operations) 
    
  As the shares used to extinguish the debt are considered nonmonetary assets, the overall gain realized of   $182,887   is composed of two elements: (1) the gain resulting from the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the shares transferred, of   $107,688   and, (2) the gain from the debt extinguishment of   $75,199  . The total gain is recorded as a gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations.

Note 6.  Stockholders  Equity 
    
  On May 12, 2016, EuroSite Power completed a private placement with related parties of   12,608,696   shares of its common stock for aggregate proceeds of   $7.25 million   at   $0.575   per share.  The shares sold in this placement are subject to a registration rights agreement where EuroSite Power has agreed to use its best efforts to register the shares issued at the request of the holder. EuroSite Power used a portion of the proceeds to pay off its debt to its former Chairman, of   $2,000,000  , with the balance being retained to fund operations and growth. 
    
  On   January 29, 2015  , the Company entered into an exchange agreement, (or the "Exchange Agreement"), with IN Holdings Corp., a holder of more than   5%   percent of the Company s common stock, (or "IN Holdings"). In connection with the Exchange Agreement, IN Holdings transferred to the Company   1,320,000   shares of the Company s common stock that it owned, and in exchange, the Company transferred to IN Holdings   1,320,000   shares of the common stock of EuroSite Power Inc. that it owned. The exchange was accounted for as an acquisition and retirement of treasury shares and a disposal of partial ownership of a consolidated subsidiary. As the Company retained a controlling financial interest following the exchange, no gain or loss was recognized on the disposal in accordance with ASC 810-10-45-23. In accordance with ASC 845-10-05-4, nonmonetary transactions, the fair value of the shares surrendered by the Company in the exchange were used to value the exchange. 
    
  On September 19, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a common stock repurchase program that shall not exceed   1,000,000   shares of common stock and shall not exceed   $1,100,000   of cost. The approval allows for purchases over a   24  -month period at prices not to exceed   $1.30   per share. During the   first nine months of 2016  , the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest joint venture partner in ADGNY, whereby, in exchange for   $100,000   cash and   100,000   shares of the Company s common stock, the noncontrolling interest partner relinquished certain economic interests in certain energy system projects in the joint venture sites owned and operated by ADGNY; and ownership of certain energy system projects owned by ADGNY was transferred to the Company; and ownership of certain energy system projects owned by ADGNY was transferred to the noncontrolling interest joint venture partner. Additionally, the interests in underlying energy system projects remaining in the joint venture following the transfers of ownership of those energy system projects described in the preceding sentence, were adjusted to   51%   and   49%   for the Company and the noncontrolling interest joint venture partner in ADGNY, respectively. Following the foregoing series of transactions, the Company retained a controlling   51%   legal interest and had a   51%   economic interest in ADGNY. 
    
  The relinquishment by the noncontrolling interest partner of certain economic interests in certain energy system projects in the joint venture sites owned and operated by ADGNY for the benefit of the Company and the adjustment of the respective interests in underlying energy system projects remaining in the joint venture were treated as changes in the Company s ownership interest in ADGNY while the Company retained a controlling financial interest, and accordingly, were accounted for as equity transactions in accordance with ASC 810-10-45-23. 
  The transfer of ownership of certain energy system projects owned by ADGNY to the noncontrolling interest joint venture partner was treated as a dividend of nonmonetary assets and was recognized at the fair value of the energy systems transferred in accordance with ASC 845-10-30-1, with a gain of   $157,870   recognized in interest and other income, which is attributed entirely to the noncontrolling interest in the accompanying financial statements.

Note 7.   Related Parties 
    
  EuroSite Power, Tecogen, Ilios Inc., or Ilios are affiliated companies by virtue of common ownership and common leadership. 
       
  The Company purchases the majority of its cogeneration units from Tecogen, an affiliate company sharing similar ownership. In addition, Tecogen pays certain operating expenses, including benefits and payroll, on behalf of the Company, and the Company leases office space from Tecogen. The Company's lease with Tecogen initially expired on July 31, 2016, however renews automatically until cancelled by one of the parties. These costs were reimbursed by the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owed Tecogen   $376,145  , and Tecogen owed the Company   $49,138  .  
    
  On May 12, 2016, EuroSite Power completed a private placement with related parties of   12,608,696   shares of its common stock for aggregate proceeds of   $7.25 million   at   $0.575   per share.   The shares sold in this placement are subject to a registration rights agreement where the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to register the shares issued at the request of the holder. EuroSite   used a portion of these proceeds to pay off its debt to its former Chairman, of   $2,000,000  , with the balance being retained to fund operations and growth.  
    
  On June 28, 2016,   $2.1 million   of Eurosite Power's   $2.4 million   of convertible debentures were converted into   3,909,260   shares of common stock of Eurosite Power at a price of   $0.54   per share. Additionally,   $11,000   of accrued interest was also converted at the same price. As the price used to convert the convertible debentures was less than the then contractual conversion price of   $0.60   per share of common stock, the fair value of the incremental shares issued to the holders of the convertible debentures over and above the contractually required amount of   $224,782   was expensed as debt conversion expense. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2015, EuroSite Power repaid   $1,000,000   of a related party   $3,000,000   note payable in accordance with the terms of the note. The balance of   $2,000,000   was repaid in connection with a private placement. 
    
  On July 7, 2015, EuroSite Power, one of the Company's previously consolidated subsidiaries, entered into a Revolving Line of Credit Agreement, (or the "Agreement"), with Elias Samaras, EuroSite Power's Chief Executive Officer and President and a member of the Company's Board of Directors. Under the terms of the Agreement, Dr. Samaras has agreed to lend EuroSite Power up to an aggregate of   $1,000,000  , upon written request. Any amounts borrowed by EuroSite Power pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest at   6%   per year. Interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears. Repayment of the principal amount borrowed pursuant to the Agreement will be due on June 30, 2017. Prepayment of any amounts due under the Agreement may be made at any time without penalty. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amounts have been drawn on this line.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, EuroSite Power owed the Company   $22,059   and   $13,638  , respectively.

Note 8.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The fair value topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
    
  Level 1   - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company currently does not have any Level 1 financial assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 2 -   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non-active markets, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. The Company considers its convertible debentures a level 2 liability and believes that its carrying value approximates fair value. 
    
  Level 3   - Unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions about the input used in pricing the asset or liability.  
    
  In connection with recognizing the distribution of energy systems to the noncontrolling interest in ADGNY (see Note 5. "Stockholders' Equity"), the Company utilized Level 3 category fair value measurements. Those measurements employed the use of discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of those energy systems. The estimated expected cash flows were discounted at a rate of   12%   per annum. 
       
  The Company utilizes a Level 3 category fair value measurement to value its investment in EuroSite Power as an available-for-sale security at period end (see Note 4 Investment in EuroSite Power and Discontinued Operations). That measurement is determined by management based on the lowest quoted closing sales price in a   31   day trading period within quarter end, which is discounted by   10%   in consideration of the significance of the shares held in relation to daily sales volume.  
    
  The following table summarizes changes in level 3 assets which are comprised of available-for-sale securities for the period: 

In connection with the valuation of the Company s remaining investment in EuroSite Power following deconsolidation (see Note 4. "Investment in EuroSite Power and Discontinued Operations"), the Company utilized a Level 3 category fair value measurement.     That measurement was determined by management based on a then proposed transaction which is disclosed as executed in Note 5 - Convertible debt, as it represents the best indication of fair value available. 

Note 9.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company has certain commitments under agreements with certain related parties (see Note 7. "Related Parties").  
  The Company, in the ordinary course of business is involved in various legal matters, the outcomes of which are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Forward-looking statements are made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   seeks,   estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our current and future cash requirements, our expectations regarding suppliers of cogeneration units, and statements regarding potential financing activities in the future. While the Company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the Company s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the Company s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report. There are a number of important factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report. 
    
  Overview 
    
  The Company distributes and operates on-site cogeneration systems that produce both electricity and heat. The Company s primary business is to own the equipment that it installs at customers  facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to its customers on a long-term contractual basis. The Company calls this business the American DG Energy  On-Site Utility . 
    
  The majority of our heating system sales are in the winter, and the majority of our chilling systems sales are in the summer. 
    
  The profitability of our business model is highly dependent on the functionality of our energy equipment, the price of electricity, the demand for electricity, and to a lesser extent, the price of natural gas. Generally, increase in demand for electricity tends to cause prices to rise. Higher electricity prices increase the Company s revenue and liquidity. Lower natural gas prices decrease operational cost. To mitigate the risk of low electrical rates, the Company pursues energy system projects in areas with higher electricity rates. 
    
  There is an ongoing consideration of how to access and lower the cost of capital. The Company regularly assesses the cost and availability of debt capital, preferred stock, convertible debentures, private equity financing, and public common stock offerings. The effect these fundraising efforts have on the business will depend on the type of fundraising. Generally, debt and convertible debenture financing will increase interest expense. Generally, convertible debentures, private equity, and public equity have the potential to dilute shareholder s earnings per share. To date, the Company has largely financed its growth through the private placements of convertible debt and equity. During the first quarter of 2016 the Company's subsidiary, EuroSite Power, signed two project financing agreements which will provide funding for projects going forward.  
    
  On May 4, 2016, the Company exchanged approximately 14.72 million of its shares in EuroSite Power, or 46% of its 48% ownership in its European subsidiary, for elimination of a portion of the outstanding 6% convertible debentures due May 2018. With this swap of EuroSite Power shares in exchange for partial extinguishment of the convertible debt, American DG Energy reduced the convertible debt outstanding to $8.6 million. The Company is pursuing a similar debt exchange transaction for the remaining convertible debt outstanding and expects to complete that subsequent transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Until June 28, 2016 the Company accounted for its investment in EuroSite Power as a consolidated subsidiary.  On June 28, 2016 substantially all of the long-term convertible indebtedness of EuroSite Power guaranteed by the Company was converted into shares of EuroSite Power.  As a result, the Company deconsolidated EuroSite Power in its consolidated financial statements and the remaining shares held by the Company were recorded at fair value which resulted in a $3.9 million gain.  (see Note 4. Investment in EuroSite Power) 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company settled $6.7 million of its $10.1 million outstanding 6% convertible debentures due May 2018 by transferring ownership of 15.2 million shares it owned of EuroSite Power in exchange for the debt. A new note evidencing the remaining balance of the debt outstanding of $3,418,681, including prepaid interest was issued, replacing the previous note. The effective interest rate on the remaining debt is identical to the previous rate prior to

the exchange. As a result, the Company has accounted for its ownership in EuroSite Power as discontinued operations as of September 30, 2016.

  Revenues 
    
  Revenues in the   third quarter of 2016   were   $1,580,863   compared to   $1,534,553   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $46,310   or   3.0%  . The increase is due to the capture and billing of demand revenue. On-Site Utility energy revenue in the   third quarter of 2016   was   $1,393,009   compared to   $1,340,627   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $52,382   or   3.9%  , due to the increase in demand billing. During the   third quarter of 2016  , in addition to our On-Site Utility energy revenue, the Company performed billable services and recorded revenue primarily from the sale of energy equipment and energy feasibility studies. The revenue from our turnkey projects can vary substantially from period to period. While the Company accepts turnkey installation projects, they are not considered our core business. Our turnkey and other revenue in the   third quarter of 2016   was   $187,854   compared to   $193,926   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $6,072   or   3.1%  . 
    
  During the   third quarter of 2016  , and 2015 the Company operated   92   energy systems, representing   5,445   kWh of installed electricity potential. The revenue per customer on a monthly basis is based on the sum of the amount of energy produced by the Company s energy systems and a contractually negotiated formula, which takes into account the monthly published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from its customers  local energy utility, less an applicable discount. The Company s revenues commence as new energy systems become operational. 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Cost of sales, including depreciation, in the   third quarter of 2016   was   $1,228,626   compared to   $1,255,983   for the same period in   2015  , a slight decrease of   $27,357   or   2.2%  .  The decrease in cost of sales is principally due to a decrease in fuel costs, offset by an increase in depreciation. The cost of fuel, maintenance and installation was   $774,161   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $837,192   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $63,031   or   7.5%  .

First Nine Months of 2016   Compared to   First Nine Months of 2015   from Continuing Operations 
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenues in the   first nine months of 2016   were   $4,567,023   compared to   $5,038,393   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $471,370   or   9.4%  . The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a lower number of sites operating in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period in   2015  . The first half of 2015, which was prior to the asset transfer of seven of LLC sites, earned revenues from more sites than the same period in 2016. Our On-Site Utility energy revenue in the   first nine months of 2016   was   $4,090,657   compared to   $4,538,832   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $448,175  , or   9.9%  .

  Based on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal co-executive officers and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our co-principal executive officers and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the  Exchange Act ) are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
    
  Remediation steps were taken in the first nine months of 2016 regarding the impairment assessment process providing a step by step approach in identifying events or changes in circumstances that would require an impairment test of its long-lived assets, estimating the future cash flows related to those long-lived assets and estimating the fair value of those long-lived assets, as required.
