  September 30, 2016      Note 1.
Organization     CM Finance Inc ( CMFN,  the  Company ), a Maryland corporation formed in May 2013, is a closed-end, externally
managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ), and has elected to be
treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment
company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946 Financial Services   Investment Companies.  
 On February 5, 2014, CM Finance Inc priced its initial public offering (the  Offering ), selling 7,666,666 shares of its common stock, par
value $0.001, including the underwriters  over-allotment, at a price of $15.00 per share with net proceeds of approximately $111.5 million.    CM
Finance LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, commenced operations in March 2012. Immediately prior to the Offering, CM Finance LLC was merged with and into CM Finance Inc (the  Merger ). In connection with the Merger, CM Finance Inc
issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock and $39.8 million in debt to the pre-existing CM Finance LLC investors, consisting of funds managed by Cyrus Capital Partners, L.P. (the  Original Investors  or the  Cyrus Funds ). CM
Finance Inc had no assets or operations prior to completion of the Merger and, as a result, the books and records of CM Finance LLC became the books and records of CM Finance Inc, as the surviving entity. Immediately after the Merger, CM Finance Inc
issued 2,181,818 shares of its common stock to Stifel Venture Corp. in exchange for $32.7 million in cash. CM Finance Inc used all of the proceeds of the sale of shares to Stifel Venture Corp., to repurchase 2,181,818 shares of common stock from the
Original Investors. Immediately after the completion of the Offering, the Company had 13,666,666 shares outstanding. The Company also used a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay 100% of the debt issued to the Original Investors in
connection with the Merger.    Upon its election to be regulated as a BDC on February 5, 2014, the Company entered into an investment advisory
agreement (the  Advisory Agreement ) and an administrative agreement with CM Investment Partners LLC (the  Adviser ) as its investment adviser and administrator, respectively.  
 The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize total return to shareholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by
investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held lower middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. The Company invests primarily in lower middle-market companies in the form of unitranche
loans, standalone first and second lien and mezzanine loans. The Company may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments.  
 As a BDC, the Company is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, the Company must not acquire any assets other than
 qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Under the
relevant SEC rules, the term  eligible portfolio company  includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have
listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States.  
 The Company consolidates the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary, CM Finance SPV, Ltd. ( SPV ), a special purpose vehicle used to finance
certain investments.    On September 23, 2014, the Company formed CM Portfolio Companies LLC, a wholly owned and consolidated taxable subsidiary.  
 The Company may form certain additional taxable subsidiaries (collectively, with CM Portfolio Companies LLC, the  Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are
taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the
Code.

   Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies   
 The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company.  
  a. Basis of Presentation     The accompanying consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and all values are stated in U.S. dollars, unless noted otherwise. The financial statements reflect all adjustments that are,
in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods included herein as required by U.S. GAAP. These adjustments are normal and recurring in nature.  
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the fair
value of investments and other amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements are reasonable and
prudent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.     b.
Revenue Recognition, Security Transactions, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses     Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and
accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis.    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.  
 Origination, closing, commitment, and amendment fees, purchase and original issue discounts associated with loans to portfolio companies are accreted into
interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Accretion of discounts or premiums is calculated by the effective interest or straight-line method, as applicable, as of the purchase date and adjusted only for material amendments
or prepayments. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized fees and discounts are recorded as interest income and are non-recurring in nature. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015, $288,951 and $756,691 of prepayment penalties and unamortized discounts upon prepayment were recorded as interest income, respectively.  
 Structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned, usually when received. Structuring fees, excess deal deposits, net profits interests and
overriding royalty interests are included in other fee income.    Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses
on investments are determined by calculating the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investments, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. Realized gains or losses
on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. The Company reports changes in fair value of investments as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Unaudited
Consolidated Statements of Operations.    Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is
reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are
likely to remain current, although management may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.  
 The Company may hold debt investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest provision. PIK interest, which represents
contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. PIK interest is not accrued if the Company does not
expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. The Company earned PIK interest of $0 and $239,239 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

   c. Paid In Capital   
 The Company records the proceeds from the sale of its common stock to common stock and additional paid-in capital, after all commissions and marketing support
fees.     d. Earnings per Share     Earnings per share is
calculated based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period.     e. Distributions   
 Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined
by the board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for
investment.    The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on
behalf of the Company s shareholders, unless a shareholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company s board of directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash distribution, then the Company s shareholders who have
not  opted out  of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.  
  f. Cash and Restricted Cash     Cash and restricted cash
consists of bank demand deposits. The Company deposits its cash in a financial institution and, at times, such balance may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. All of the Company s cash deposits are held
at large established high credit quality financial institutions and management believes that the risk of loss associated with any uninsured balances is remote. The Company has restrictions on the uses of the cash held by SPV based on the terms of
the Notes Payable. For more information on the Notes Payable, see Note 5.     g. Deferred Offering Costs   
 Deferred offering costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offer and sale of the Company s common stock and bonds, including
legal, accounting, printing fees and other related expenses, as well as costs incurred in connection with the filing of a shelf registration statement. These costs are capitalized when incurred and recognized as a reduction of offering proceeds when
the offering becomes effective.     h. Investment Transactions and Expenses   
 Purchases of loans, including revolving credit agreements, are recorded on a fully committed basis until the funded and unfunded portions are known or
estimable, which in many cases may not be until settlement.    Expenses are accrued as incurred.  
 Deferred debt issuance costs, incurred in connection with the Company s Notes Payable, are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the
notes.    Offering costs were charged to paid-in capital upon sale of shares in the Offering.  
  i. Investment Valuation     The Company applies fair value
accounting to all of its financial instruments in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and
requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized its investments and financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair
value

hierarchy as discussed in Note 4. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific
measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.
   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (a) are independent of us, (b) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all
available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (c) are able to transact for the asset, and (d) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is,
they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so).    Securities that are traded on securities exchanges (including such securities traded
in the afterhours market) are valued on the basis of the closing price on the valuation date (if such prices are available). Securities that are traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the closing price on the primary securities
exchange on which such securities are traded on the valuation date (or if reported on the consolidated tape, then their last sales price on the consolidated tape). Listed options for which the last sales price falls between the last  bid 
and  ask  prices for such options, are valued at their last sales price on the date of the valuation on the primary securities exchange on which such options are traded. Options for which the last sales price on the valuation date does not
fall between the last  bid  and  ask  prices are valued at the average of the last  bid  and  ask  prices for such options on that date. To the extent these securities are actively traded, and valuation
adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company did not hold any Level 1 investments as of September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016.  
 Investments that are not traded on securities exchanges but are traded on the over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets (such as term loans, notes and
warrants) are valued using various techniques, which may consider recently executed transactions in securities of the issuer or comparable issuers, market price quotations (when observable) and fundamental data relating to the issuer. These
investments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or in instances when lower relative weight is placed on transaction prices, quotations, or similar observable inputs, they are categorized in Level 3.  
 The embedded derivatives in the Term Notes payable (defined below) from SPV to UBS, AG ( UBS ) and the Total Return Swaps (the  TRS )
referencing the terms of the Notes Payable are valued based on the change in fair value and the underlying accrued interest of the portfolio of assets held in SPV less the accrued interest payable on the financing due to the TRS counterparty, UBS.
Consideration has been given to counterparty risk. The Company has assessed the unsecured risk of the counterparty, UBS, in the form of credit ratings and the trading levels of that risk and has determined that the counterparty risk is minimal. The
Company also notes that counterparty risk is further mitigated by the monthly settlement of both the interest portion of the embedded derivatives referencing the Notes Payable and the TRS. If the Company were to determine that counterparty risk were
material, an adjustment to the fair value of the TRS would be made. The embedded derivatives in the Notes Payable and the TRS have been categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 4 and Note 5 for more detail.  
 Investments for which market quotations are not readily available or may be considered unreliable are fair valued, in good faith, using a method determined to
be appropriate in the given circumstances. The valuation methods used include the Cost Approach, the Market Approach and the Income Approach. Inputs used in these approaches may include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, credit
spreads, recovery rates, comparable company transactions, trading multiples, and volatilities. The valuation method of the Company may change as changes in the underlying company dictates, such as moving from the Cost Approach to Market Approach
when underlying conditions change at the company. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation in these circumstances, the fair values for the aforementioned investments may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready
and liquid market for such investments existed or from the amounts that might ultimately be realized, and such differences could be material.    The
Company s valuation policies and procedures are developed by the Adviser, which is also responsible for ensuring that the valuation policies and procedures are consistently applied across all investments of the Company, and approved by the
Company s board of directors. The valuations are continuously monitored and the valuation process for Level 3 investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level 3 investments to an appropriate level
of consistency, oversight and review. The valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment. These investment
professionals prepare the preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable securities from the same company or that of comparable companies as well as
any other relevant factors including recent purchases and sales that may have occurred preceding month-end.

  Valuation models are typically calibrated upon initial funding, and are re-calibrated as necessary upon
subsequent material events (including, but not limited to additional financing activity, changes in comparable companies, and recent trades). The preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the
Adviser. On a periodic basis and at least once annually, independent valuation firm(s) engaged by the Company conduct independent appraisals and review the Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment. The
Valuation Committee of the Company s board of directors then reviews the preliminary valuations of the Adviser and that of the independent valuation firms. The Valuation Committee discusses the valuations and makes a recommendation to the
Company s board of directors regarding the fair value of each investment in good faith based on the input of the Adviser and the independent valuation firms. Upon recommendation by the Valuation Committee and a review of the valuation materials
of the Adviser and the third party independent valuation firms, the board of directors of the Company determines, in good faith, the fair value of each investment.  
 For more information on the classification of the Company s investments by major categories, see Note 4.  
 The fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP approximates the carrying amounts presented
in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.     j. Income Taxes   
 The Company has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To qualify and maintain qualification as
a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of the Company s  investment company taxable
income,   which is generally the Company s net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. If the Company continues to qualify as a RIC and continues to
satisfy the annual distribution requirement, the Company will not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income that the Company distributes to its shareholders. The Company intends to make distributions in an amount sufficient to
maintain RIC status each year and to avoid any federal income taxes on income. The Company will also be subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if the Company does not distribute to its shareholders at least 98% of net ordinary income, 98.2%
of capital gains, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior year for which it paid no federal income taxes.    Book and tax basis
differences that are permanent differences are reclassified among the Company s capital accounts, as appropriate at year-end. Additionally, the tax character of distributions is determined in accordance with the Code, which differs from U.S.
GAAP. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company recorded distributions of $4.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The tax character of a portion of these distributions may be return of
capital.    U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to
determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year.
The Company s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.    The
Company has analyzed such tax positions and has concluded that no unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded for uncertain tax positions for any tax year since inception. Each of the tax years since inception remain subject to examination by
taxing authorities. This conclusion may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors, including but not limited to, ongoing analysis and changes to laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof.  
  k. Capital Gains Incentive Fee     Under U.S. GAAP, the
Company calculates the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser as if the Company had realized all investments at their fair values as of the reporting date. Accordingly, the Company accrues a provisional capital gains incentive fee taking
into account any unrealized gains or losses. As the provisional capital gains incentive fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of provisional capital gains incentive fee accrued at a reporting
date may vary from the incentive fee that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material.    The cost basis used to compute gains and losses
for the purpose of determining incentive fees is the fair value of the Company s investment on February 5, 2014, at the time the Company priced its Offering.

Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)       
  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there was no capital gains incentive fee payable to the
Adviser under the Advisory Agreement.     Note 3. New Accounting Pronouncements   
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified
effective date. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption.  
  Note 4. Investments     The Company s investments at
any time may include securities and other financial instruments, including, without limitation, corporate and government bonds, convertible securities, collateralized loan obligations, term loans, trade claims, equity securities, privately
negotiated securities, direct placements, working interests, warrants and investment derivatives (such as credit default swaps, recovery swaps, total return swaps, options, forward contracts, and futures) (all of the foregoing collectively referred
to in these financial statements as  investments. )     a. Certain Risk Factors   
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company manages a variety of risks including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company identifies,
measures and monitors risk through various control mechanisms, including trading limits and diversifying exposures and activities across a variety of instruments, markets and counterparties.  
 Market risk is the risk of potential adverse changes to the value of financial instruments because of changes in market conditions, including as a result of
changes in the credit quality of a particular issuer, credit spreads, interest rates, and other movements and volatility in security prices or commodities. In particular, the Company may invest in issuers that are experiencing or have experienced
financial or business difficulties (including difficulties resulting from the initiation or prospect of significant litigation or bankruptcy proceedings), which involves significant risks. The Company manages its exposure to market risk through the
use of risk management strategies and various analytical monitoring techniques.    The Company s assets may, at any time, include securities and other
financial instruments or obligations that are illiquid or thinly traded, making purchase or sale of such securities and financial instruments at desired prices or in desired quantities difficult. Furthermore, the sale of any such investments may be
possible only at substantial discounts, and it may be extremely difficult to value any such investments accurately.    Credit risk is the potential loss the
Company may incur from a failure of an issuer to make payments according to the terms of a contract. The Company is subject to credit risk because of its strategy of investing in the debt of leveraged companies and its involvement in derivative
instruments. The Company s exposure to credit risk on its investments is limited to the fair value of the investments. The Company s TRS contracts are executed pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association
( ISDA ) master agreement (the  ISDA Agreement ) that the Company currently has in place with UBS. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had all of its counterparty credit risk associated with
non-performance for swaps with UBS. With regard to derivatives, the Company attempts to limit its credit risk by considering its counterparty s (or its guarantor s) credit rating. The Company s policy is to not hold counterparty
collateral on ISDA Agreements, but would do so if the exposure were material.     b. Investments   
 Investment purchases, sales and principal payments/paydowns are summarized below for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, respectively. These purchase and sale amounts exclude derivative instruments.

Investments (Continued)       
  The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize total return to shareholders in the form of
current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held lower middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company made investments in new and existing portfolio companies of approximately $19.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide financial support. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not make investments in companies to which it was previously committed to provide financial support. The details of the Company s investments have been disclosed on the Unaudited
Consolidated Schedule of Investments.     c. Derivatives   
 Derivative contracts include total return swaps and embedded derivatives in Notes Payable. The Company enters into derivative contracts as part of its
investment strategies.    The Company and UBS entered into two TRS transactions whereby the Company will receive the total return of the Term Notes and the
Revolving Notes (as defined in Note 5) purchased by UBS and pay the Financing Rate and the Revolver Financing Rate (both as defined in Note 5). Therefore, amounts required for the future satisfaction of the swaps may be greater or less than the
amount recorded. Realized and change in unrealized gains and losses on total return swaps, if any, are included in the net realized gain or loss on derivatives, and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on derivatives in the Unaudited
Consolidated Statements of Operations.    In connection with the TRS transactions the Company entered into an ISDA Agreement with UBS. The ISDA Agreement
includes provisions for general obligations, representations, collateral and events of default or termination. Under an ISDA Agreement, the Company typically may offset with the counterparty certain derivative payable and/or receivable with
collateral held and/or posted and create one single net payment (close-out netting) in the event of default or termination.    The Company s ISDA
Agreement may contain provisions for early termination of OTC derivative transactions in the event the net assets of the Company decline below specific levels ( net asset contingent features ). If these levels are triggered, the
Company s counterparty has the right to terminate such transaction and require the Company to pay or receive a settlement amount in connection with the terminated transaction.  
 The Company has determined that each of the Term Notes payable from SPV to UBS (discussed further in Note 5) contain an embedded derivative. SPV is obligated
to pay UBS the net appreciation (depreciation) of the SPV Assets, as defined below, as well as pay any income generated by the SPV Assets until maturity. Therefore, amounts required for the future satisfaction of the note may be greater or less than
the amount recorded. Realized and change in unrealized gains and losses on the embedded derivatives are included in the net realized gain or loss on derivatives, and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on derivatives in the
Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.    The following table reflects the fair value and notional amount or number of contracts of the
Company s derivative contracts, none of which were designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP, which are presented on a gross basis, at September 30, 2016.

    d. Fair Value Measurements   
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability based upon their transparency. The valuation
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value have been classified in the following three categories:  
 Level 1   valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
at the measurement date.    Level 2   valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets
in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; (c) inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (d) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  
 Level 3   valuation is based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that
observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, an
exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available under the circumstances, which might include the Company s own data. The Company s own data used to develop
unobservable inputs is adjusted if information is reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants would use different assumptions.  
 The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of
security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of the market and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.

  Estimates of fair value for cash and restricted cash are measured using observable, quoted market prices, or
Level 1 inputs. All other fair value significant estimates are measured using unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs.    The following table summarizes the
classifications within the fair value hierarchy of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016:

   Transfers into Level 3 during or at the end of the reporting period are reported under Level 1 or Level 2 as of the beginning
of the period. Transfers out of Level 3 during or at the end of the reporting period are reported under Level 3 as of the beginning of the period. Changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 instruments are included in net change in
unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments and derivatives on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.    During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company did not transfer any investments among Levels 1 and 2 and 3.    The following tables
present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company s Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the
valuation of each type of investment. These inputs are not representative of the inputs that could have been used in the valuation of any one investment. For example, the highest market yield presented in the table for senior secured notes is
appropriate for valuing a specific investment but may not be appropriate for valuing any other investment. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the
Company s Level 3 investments.

  Fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology
used to determine fair value and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value. Significant increases in illiquidity discounts, PIK discounts and market yields would result in significantly lower fair value
measurements.     Note 5. Notes Payable     On May 23,
2013, as amended on June 6, 2013, December 4, 2013 and September 26, 2014, July 20, 2015 and August 14, 2015, the Company, through SPV, entered into a $102.0 million financing transaction (the  Term
Facility ) due December 5, 2018 with UBS. The Term Facility is collateralized by the portion of the Company s assets held by SPV (the  SPV Assets ) and pledged as collateral as noted in the Consolidated Schedule of
Investments. The Company will pay interest on the face amount of the Term Facility at a rate of one month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.75% per annum (the  Financing Rate ). Prior to September 26, 2014, the Company paid interest on
the Term Facility at a rate of one month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.85% per annum.    On December 4, 2013, as amended on September 26, 2014 and
July 17, 2015, the Company, through SPV, entered into a $50.0 million revolving financing (the  Revolving Financing  and together with the Term Facility, the  Financing Facility ), which expires on December 5, 2016. The
Revolving Financing bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum on drawn amounts and 0.50% per annum on any undrawn portion. Prior to September 26, 2014, the rate on drawn amounts was 2.10% per annum through
December 4, 2014, and 1.60% thereafter. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, $14.5 and $30.5 million was outstanding on the Revolving Financing, respectively.  
 This financing transaction was initially executed in four steps:  
 First, the Company organized SPV, a consolidated wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle in the Cayman Islands to purchase the SPV Assets
through (i) the issuance and sale of notes secured by the SPV Assets (the  Term Notes ) to UBS and the Company and (ii) the transfer of cash to the Company. UBS purchased Term Notes with a face value of $76.5 million, which
represent 51% of the Term Notes issued and outstanding, for $76.5 million in cash. The Company purchased Term Notes with a face value of $73.5 million (which are eliminated in consolidation), which represent 49% of the Term Notes issued and
outstanding. Under the terms of the indenture under which the Term Notes were issued (the  Indenture ), the holders of the Term Notes are entitled to (i) periodic interest payments equal to their pro rata portion of the interest
collected on the assets held by SPV and (ii) their pro-rata portion of the net appreciation (depreciation) on the SPV Assets at maturity (the  Total Return of the Term Notes ). This represents the embedded derivative in the Term Notes
payable from SPV to UBS. On September 26, 2014, the Company increased the size of the Term Facility to $102.0 million. In connection with the upsize, UBS purchased additional Term Notes with a face value of $25.5 million for $25.5 million in
cash. The Company also purchased additional Term Notes with a face value of $24.5 million.    Second, the Company and UBS entered into a TRS transaction
whereby the Company will receive the Total Return of the Term Notes purchased by UBS and pay the Financing Rate.    Third, SPV issued and sold an additional
$50.0 million notes (the  Revolving Notes ) together with the Term Notes, the  Notes , secured by the SPV Assets to UBS. Cash is only exchanged when the Revolving Notes are drawn. Under the terms of the Indenture under which the
Revolving Notes were issued (the  Revolver Indenture ), the holders of the Revolving Notes are entitled to (i) periodic interest payments equal to their pro rata portion of the interest collected on the SPV Assets and (ii) their
pro-rata portion of the net appreciation (depreciation) on the SPV Assets at maturity (the  Total Return of the Revolving Notes ). This represents the embedded derivative in the Revolving Notes payable from SPV to UBS.  
 Fourth, the Company and UBS entered into another TRS transaction whereby the Company will receive the Total Return of the Revolving Notes purchased by UBS and
pay the Revolver Financing Rate.    The fair value of the Company s Notes Payable is estimated based on the rate at which similar facilities would be
priced. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the fair value of the Notes Payable was estimated at $116.5 million and $132.5 million, respectively, which the Company concluded was a Level 3 fair value.  
 Cash, restricted (as shown on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities) is held by the trustee of the Financing Facility and is
restricted to purchases of investments by SPV that must meet certain eligibility criteria identified by the Indenture. As of September 30, 2016, SPV had assets of $216.4 million, which included $210.1 million of the Company s portfolio
investments at fair value, $2.2 million of accrued interest receivable and $4.1 million in cash held by the trustee of the Financing Facility. As of June 30, 2016,

SPV had assets of $248.2 million, which included $241.8 million of the Company s portfolio investments at fair value, $1.9 million of accrued interest receivable and $4.5 million in cash
held by the trustee of the Financing Facility. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average outstanding debt balance and the weighted average stated interest rate under the Financing Facility was $123.6 million and 3.18%,
respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the weighted average outstanding debt balance and the weighted average stated interest rate under the Financing Facility was $142.2 million and 2.76%, respectively.  
  Note 6. Indemnification, Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies   
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of representations and warranties and general indemnifications. Such
contracts include those with certain service providers, brokers and trading counterparties. Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements is unknown as it would involve future claims that may be made against the Company; however, based on the
Company s experience, the risk of loss is remote and no such claims are expected to occur. As such, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.  
 The Company s Board of Directors declared the following quarterly distributions:  
   
   Loans purchased by the Company may include revolving credit agreements or other financing commitments obligating the Company
to advance additional amounts on demand. The Company generally sets aside sufficient liquid assets to cover its unfunded commitments, if any.    The
following table details the unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016:      
   As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any unfunded commitments.  
  Note 7. Agreements and Related Party Transactions   
  Related Party Transactions     As of September 30, 2016,
Mr. Michael C. Mauer, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Christopher E. Jansen, the Company s President and Secretary and members of the Company s board of directors together owned approximately 1.60%
of the Company s outstanding common stock, and Messrs. Mauer and Jansen also hold a 42.0% interest in the Adviser.    As of September 30, 2016,
Stifel Venture Corp. ( Stifel ) owned approximately 16.0% of the Company s outstanding common stock, and also holds a 20.0% interest in the Adviser.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Cyrus Funds ( Cyrus ) owned approximately 27.9% of the Company s outstanding common stock and a 38.0%
economic interest in the Adviser.    In connection with the Offering, the Adviser, paid $3.45 million or 50.0% of the total underwriting costs, and offering
costs in excess of the $1.2 million paid by Company.

Agreements and Related Party Transactions (Continued)       
   Investment Advisory Agreement   
 Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to the Adviser a base management fee of 1.75% of gross assets, as adjusted, including assets
purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents and  fair value of derivatives associated with the Company s financing , and an incentive fee consisting of two parts.  
 The first part of the incentive fee, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the  pre-incentive fee net investment
income  (as defined in the agreement) for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized), and is subject to a  catch-up  feature. The incentive fee is subject to a total return
requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the
then current and 12 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 12 preceding quarters. The net pre-incentive fee investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the
amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee.    The second part of the incentive fee is calculated and payable
in arrears as of the end of each calendar year and equals 20.0% of the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate
cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.  
 The Adviser has agreed to permanently waive: (i) all or portions of base management fees through December 31, 2014, to the extent required to
support an annualized dividend yield of 9.0% per annum based on the price per share of the Company s common stock in the Offering of $15.00, and (ii) all or portions of the incentive fee for 2014, 2015 and 2016, to the extent required
to support an annualized dividend yield of 9.0%, 9.25% and 9.375% per annum, respectively, based on the price per share of the Company s common stock in of the Offering of $15.00. Fees permanently waived by the Adviser are not subject to
future repayment or recoupment by the Company.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, $1,211,535 in base management fees were earned by the
Adviser, of which $1,211,535 was payable at September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, $1,452,157 in base management fees were earned by the Adviser, of which $1,452,157 was payable at September 30, 2015.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $0 of incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income. As of
September 30, 2016, $7,388 of such incentive fees are currently payable to the Adviser and $268,152 of pre-incentive fees incurred by the Company were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK and certain discount accretion) and are not
payable until such amounts are received in cash. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $1,229,032 of incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income, of which $0 was waived. As of
September 30, 2015, $1,101,891 of such incentive fees were payable to the Adviser and $401,807 of pre-incentive fees incurred by the Company were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK and certain discount accretion) and are not payable
until such amounts are received in cash.    The capital gains incentive fee consists of fees related to both realized gains and unrealized gains. As of
September 30, 2016, there was no capital gains incentive fee earned or payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, there was no capital gains incentive fee earned or payable to the Adviser under the Advisory
Agreement.    With respect to the incentive fee expense accrual relating to the capital gains incentive fee, U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains
incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized appreciation is not
permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement.    The Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees,
controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and amounts reasonably
paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Adviser.

Agreements and Related Party Transactions (Continued)       
  Prior to the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC on February 5, 2014, no base management or
incentive fees were due and payable.     Administration Agreement   
 The Company entered into an administration agreement with the Adviser pursuant to which the Adviser furnishes the Company with office facilities and equipment
and will provide the Company with the clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations. Under this administration agreement, the Adviser will perform, or oversee the performance of,
its required administrative services, which includes, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which it is required to maintain and preparing reports to its shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. Under an administration
agreement with the Adviser, the Adviser provides the Company with the Company s other accounting and back-office professionals, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services. The Investment Adviser has
also retained the services of accounting and back office professionals on an as needed basis through a services agreement with the Cyrus Funds to assist the Adviser in fulfilling certain of its obligations to the Company under the administration
agreement. The Company incurred costs of $268,242 under the administration agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company incurred costs of $276,951 under the administration agreement for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.    As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $106,741 and $120,000, respectively, in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on its Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities for reimbursement of expenses owed to the Adviser under the administration agreement.  
  License Agreement     The Company has entered into a license
agreement with the Adviser under which the Adviser has agreed to grant the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  CM Finance.  Under this agreement, the Company has a right to use the  CM Finance  name for
so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains the Adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company has no legal right to the  CM Finance  name.  
  Stifel Arrangement     In December 2013, the Company entered
into an arrangement pursuant to which Stifel made a capital contribution to the Company on February 5, 2014 and the Company granted Stifel certain rights, such as a right to nominate for election a member of the Company s board of
directors. Stifel has not exercised its right to nominate for election a member of the Company s board of directors. Stifel does not have any rights to exercise a controlling influence over the Company s day-to-day operations or the
investment management function of the Adviser.    Five of the investment professionals employed by the Adviser as part of the investment team are also
employees of Stifel. Although these investment professionals dedicate substantially all of their time to the business and activities of the Adviser, they are dual employees of both Stifel and the Adviser, and as a result, may continue to engage in
investment advisory activities for Stifel.     Note 8. Directors Fees   
 Each of the Company s four independent directors receive (i) an annual fee of $75,000, and (ii) $2,500 plus reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending in person or telephonically each regular board of directors meeting and each special telephonic meeting. The Company s independent directors also receive $1,000 plus reimbursement of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with each committee meeting attended in person and each telephonic committee meeting. The chairman of the audit committee receives an annual fee of $7,500. The chairperson of the valuation
committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation committee receives an annual fee of $2,500, $2,500 and $2,500, respectively. The Company has obtained directors  and officers  liability insurance on behalf
of the Company s directors and officers. Independent directors have the option of having their directors  fees paid in shares of the Company s common stock issued at a price per share equal to the greater of net asset value or the
market price at the time of payment. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company recorded directors  fees of $100,000 and $114,750, respectively, of which $0 and $0 were payable at
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

 In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 260   Earnings per Share ( ASC 260 ), basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted
basis.    The following table sets forth the computation of the weighted average basic and diluted net increase in net assets per share from operations:

    Note 15. Subsequent Events   
 The Company has evaluated the need for disclosures and/or adjustments resulting from subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements
were issued.    On November 9, 2016, the Company entered into a 2.5 year, $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  New Revolving
Financing ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citibank ), which is secured by collateral consisting primarily of commercial loans and corporate bonds. The New Revolving Financing will expire on May 1, 2019.  
 Borrowings under the New Revolving Financing will generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.85%. Default interest rate will be equal
to the interest rate then in effect plus 2.00%. The New Revolving Financing requires the payment of an unused fee of 2.85% annually for any undrawn amounts below 75% of the New Revolving Financing, and 0.75% annually for any undrawn amounts above
75% of the New Revolving Financing. Borrowings under the New Revolving Financing are based on a borrowing base. The New Revolving Financing generally requires payment of interest on a quarterly basis. All outstanding principal is due upon maturity.
The New Revolving Financing also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events.    Subsequent to the three months ended
September 30, 2016 through November 9, 2016, the Company invested $14.5 million in new and existing portfolio companies and received repayment or sales proceeds of $23.0 million.

 CM Finance Inc ( CMFN,  the  Company ,  us ,  we  or  our ), a Maryland corporation formed in
May 2013, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
 1940 Act ), and intends to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, (the  Code ), for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  
 Our primary investment objective is to maximize total return to stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by
investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held lower middle market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. We invest primarily in lower middle-market companies in the form of unitranche loans,
standalone first and second lien and mezzanine loans. We may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments.

  On February 5, 2014, we priced our initial public offering, selling 7,666,666 shares of our
common stock, par value $0.001, including the underwriters  over-allotment, at a price of $15.00 per share with net proceeds of approximately $111.5 million.  
 CM Finance LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, commenced operations in March 2012. Immediately prior to our initial public offering,
the merger was consummated, whereby CM Finance LLC merged with and into us (the  Merger ). In connection with the Merger, we issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock and $39.8 million in debt to the pre-existing CM Finance LLC investors,
consisting of certain funds (the  Cyrus Funds ) managed by Cyrus Capital. CM Finance Inc had no assets or operations prior to completion of the Merger and, as a result, the books and records of CM Finance LLC became our books and records,
as the surviving entity. Immediately after the Merger, we issued 2,181,818 shares of our common stock to Stifel in exchange for $32.7 million in cash. We used all of the proceeds of the sale of shares to Stifel, to repurchase 2,181,818 shares of
common stock from the Cyrus Funds. Immediately after the completion of the initial public offering, we had 13,666,666 shares outstanding. We also used a portion of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to repay 100% of the debt issued to
the Cyrus Funds in connection with the Merger.    Upon our election to be regulated as a BDC on February 5, 2014, we entered into the
investment advisory agreement (the  Advisory Agreement ) and the administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement ) with the Adviser as our investment adviser and administrator, respectively.  
 We consolidate the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, CM Finance SPV Ltd. ( CM SPV ), a special purpose vehicle used to
finance certain investments, and CM Portfolio Companies LLC, a taxable subsidiary formed to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements for a RIC under the Code.  
   Critical accounting policies      Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation of
these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in
determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting
policies are further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.     Valuation of portfolio investments   
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies adopted by our board
of directors. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most
advantageous) market for the asset that (a) are independent of us, (b) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due
diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (c) are able to transact for the asset, and (d) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so).  
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to
represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker dealers or market makers.  
 Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent
fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Because a readily available market value for many of the investments in our portfolio is often not available, we value many of our portfolio investments at
fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors. Due to the inherent
uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available
market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value
some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may also be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and
circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a  
      32  

Table of Contents  

particular security causes current market quotations not to reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently, causing a
quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a  forced  sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the
bid ask spread.    With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a
multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:      

our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the members of the Adviser s investment team responsible for the portfolio investment;    

preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed by our senior management and the Adviser;        

on a periodic basis, at least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors;    

the valuation committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes a recommendation to our board of directors regarding the fair value of each investment; and    

the board of directors then reviews and discusses these preliminary valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser, the independent
valuation firm and the valuation committee.      Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for
which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The
measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as
relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information
rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of
peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values.  
 When valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs
refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances.    Our investments are categorized based on the types
of inputs used in their valuation. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Investments are classified by GAAP
into the three broad levels as follows:      

Level I 
    
 Investments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  

Level II 
    
 Investments valued using other unadjusted observable market inputs, e.g. quoted prices in markets that are not active or quotes for comparable instruments.  

Level III 
    
 Investments that are valued using quotes and other observable market data to the extent available, but which also take into consideration one or more unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation taken as a
whole.  
   As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, all of our investments were classified as Level 3
investments, determined based on valuations by our board of directors.    Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and
estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.

   Revenue recognition   
 Our revenue recognition policies are as follows:  
  Net realized gains (losses) on investments:  Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification
method.     Interest Income:  Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an
accrual basis. Origination, closing, commitment, and amendment fees, purchase and original issue discounts associated with loans to portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Accretion of
discounts or premiums is calculated by the effective interest or straight-line method, as applicable, as of the purchase date and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment
penalties and unamortized fees and discounts are recorded as interest income and are non-recurring in nature.    Structuring fees and
similar fees are recognized as income as earned, usually when received. Structuring fees, excess deal deposits, net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other fee income.  
 We may hold debt investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest provision. The PIK interest, which
represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected.  
  Non-accrual:  Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is
reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal
depending upon management s judgment about ultimate collectability of principal. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. PIK
interest is not accrued if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. As of September 30, 2016, we had two investments on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 4.5% of our portfolio at fair
value. As of June 30, 2016, we had two investments on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 6.2% of our portfolio at fair value.  
   Financing Facility      On
May 23, 2013, as amended on June 6, 2013, December 4, 2013, September 26, 2014, July 17, 2015, July 20, 2015 and August 14, 2015, we, through CM SPV, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a
financing facility (the  Financing Facility ) with UBS AG, London Branch (together with its affiliates,  UBS ). The Financing Facility includes a $102.0 million term securitized financing facility (the  Term
Financing ), which expires on December 5, 2018 and a $50.0 million revolving financing (the  Revolving Financing ), which expires on December 5, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Term Financing bears interest at LIBOR
plus 2.75% and the Revolving Financing at a fixed rate of 2.00% on the drawn portion and at 0.50% per annum on the undrawn portion. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we had $102.0 million and $102.0 million outstanding under
the Term Financing, respectively, and $14.5 million and $30.5 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility, respectively.      Investments
     Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the
amount we have available to invest as well as the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of
investments we make.    As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we may not acquire
any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include
investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Under the relevant SEC rules, the term  eligible portfolio company  includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and
certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million. In each case, the company must be organized in the United States. As of September 30, 2016,
approximately 9.9% of our total assets were non-qualifying assets.    To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain
source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.

    Revenues    
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from royalty income, dividends on our
equity interests and capital gains on the sale of warrants and other debt or equity interests that we acquire. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper
constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due
entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest
will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees
and other investment related income.      Expenses    
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and, depending on our operating results, incentive fees, expenses
reimbursable by us under the Advisory Agreement, and administration fees and our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement. The base management fee and incentive compensation remunerates the Adviser for work in identifying,
evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to:  

our organization, the formation transactions and our initial public offering;        

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm(s));        

fees and expenses payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our
prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;        

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;    

offerings of our common stock and other securities;        

administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including our allocable portion of the Adviser s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement,
including rent, equipment and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs  compensation and compensation-related expenses);    

transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;        

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), and other applicable federal and state securities laws, and stock
exchange listing fees;        

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;        

federal, state and local taxes;        

independent directors  fees and expenses;        

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to or communications and meetings with stockholders;        

costs associated with investor relations;        

costs and fees associated with any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;    

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff; and    

all other expenses incurred by us or the Adviser in connection with administering our business.       Portfolio
and investment activity       Portfolio composition    
 We invest primarily in lower middle-market companies in the form of unitranche loans, standalone first and second lien and mezzanine loans. We
may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments.    At
September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio of $264.2 million (at fair value) consisted of investments in 22 portfolio companies, of which 63.1% were first lien investments, 36.8% were second lien investments, and 0.1% were in equity and
warrant positions. At September 30, 2016, our average and largest portfolio company investment at fair value was $12.0 million and $28.9 million, respectively.

  At June 30, 2016, our investment portfolio of $272.1 million (at fair value) consisted of
investments in 22 portfolio companies, of which 57.7% were first lien investments, 42.2% were second lien investments, and 0.1% were in equity and warrant positions. At June 30, 2016, our average and largest portfolio company investment at fair
value was $12.4 million and $29.0 million, respectively.    As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, our weighted
average total yield of debt and income producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.02% and 9.80%, respectively.  
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, the industry composition of our portfolio at fair value was as follows:  
   
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we added five new investments totaling approximately
$24.3 million. Three of these investments were in new portfolio companies. Of the new investments, 100% consisted of first lien investments.  
 At September 30, 2016, 90.2% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates based on indices such as LIBOR (in certain
cases, subject to interest rate floors), and 9.8% bore interest at fixed rates. At June 30, 2016, 87.9% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates based on indices such as LIBOR (in certain cases, subject to interest rate
floors), and 11.6% bore interest at fixed rates.    Our investment portfolio may contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or
revolving credit facilities, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had one investment with an unfunded commitment
and as of June 30, 2016, we had no investments with unfunded commitments.      Asset Quality    
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use the Adviser s investment rating system to characterize and monitor the
credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:  

Investment Rating 1 
    
 Investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.  

Investment Rating 2 
    
 Investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans will initially be rated 2.  

Investment Rating 3 
    
 Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with their financial
covenants.  

Investment Rating 4 
    
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in workout. Investments with a rating of 4 will be those for
which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.  

Investment Rating 5 
    
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in workout. Investments with a rating of 5 will be
those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.  
 
      36  

Table of Contents  

  If the Adviser determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that
the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, the Adviser will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending
events and suggesting recommended actions. While the investment rating system identifies the relative risk for each investment, the rating alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that will be performed. The frequency of
the Adviser s monitoring of an investment will be determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing
the investment.    The following table shows the investment rankings of the debt investments in our portfolio:  
   
    Results of Operations   
   Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
  Investment income     Investment income,
attributable primarily to interest and fees on our debt investments, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $7.6 million from $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the repayment of
portfolio companies with higher yields the quarter ended September 30, 2016.     Expenses   
 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $3.6 million compared to $5.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in income based incentive fees.     Net investment income   
 Net investment income decreased to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.9 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in investment income primarily due to the repayment of portfolio companies with higher yields and two investments on non-accrual.  
  Net realized gain or loss     During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, a we had a realized loss of $8.0, primarily due to the restructuring of AAR Intermediate Holdings, LLC.  
 The net realized loss on investments totaled $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments   
 We recorded a net change in unrealized appreciation of $8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the
restructuring of AAR Intermediate Holdings, LLC and an increase in valuations of certain investments.  
      37  

Table of Contents  

  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net change in unrealized
depreciation of $4.9 million primarily due to a decline in fair value of our investments in AP NMT Acquisitions, AAR Intermediate Holdings, LLC., Caelus Energy, AM General and Trident.  
  Liquidity and capital resources      Cash flows   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our unrestricted cash balance decreased by $5.9 million. During that period, we
generated $14.9 million in cash from operating activities, primarily due to proceeds from repayment and sale of investments in portfolio companies of $33.2 million, offset by investments of $24.3 million in portfolio companies. During the same
period, we used $20.8 million towards financing activities, consisting primarily of distributions to our stockholders and repayments to our Revolving Facility.  
  Capital Resources     As of
September 30, 2016, we had $12.6 million of cash as well as $16.1 million in restricted cash and $35.5 million of capacity under the Revolving Financing. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities,
future borrowings under the Revolving Financing as well as cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies and, to a lesser extent, from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities
and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal repayments on our Financing Facility, our unfunded loan commitments (if any), investments in portfolio companies,
dividend distributions to our stockholders and operating expenses.    As discussed below in further detail, we have elected to be treated as
a RIC under the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends. Our net taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in
accordance with GAAP.     Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions   
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. If we qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company
taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders on a timely basis.  
 Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the
recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the
distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.  
 To qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90%
of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). We will also be subject to a federal excise tax, based on
distributive requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis.    We intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and
100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants contained in the Financing Facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our
ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such
amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our
stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal
taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.  
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of
these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in Financing Facility. We
cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.  
      38

  In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by
the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each shareholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a
limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each shareholder electing to receive cash must receive a
pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any shareholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are
met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in
accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings.     Investment Advisory Agreement   
 Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay to the Adviser a base management fee of 1.75% of gross assets, as adjusted, including
assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents and  fair value of derivatives associated with our financing , and an incentive fee consisting of two parts.  
 The first part of the incentive fee, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the  pre-incentive fee net
investment income  (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized), and is subject to a  catch-up  feature. The incentive fee is subject
to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from
operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. The net pre-incentive fee investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also
included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee.    The second part of the incentive fee is
calculated and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year and equals 20.0% of the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital
losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.  
 The Adviser has agreed to permanently waive: (i) all or portions of base management fees through December 31, 2014, to the extent
required to support an annualized dividend yield of 9.0% per annum based on the price per share of our common stock in the initial public offering of $15.00, and (ii) all or portions of the incentive fee for 2014, 2015 and 2016, to the
extent required to support an annualized dividend yield of 9.0%, 9.25% and 9.375% per annum, respectively, based on the price per share of the our common stock in the initial public offering of $15.00. Fees permanently waived by the Adviser are
not subject to future repayment or recoupment by the Adviser.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, $1,211,535 and $1,452,157 in base management fees were earned by the Adviser, respectively, of which $1,211,535 and $1,452,157 were payable at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $0 of incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income. As of
September 30, 2016, $7,388 of previous incentive fees are currently payable to the Adviser which consist of $268,152 of pre-incentive fees incurred by us that were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK and certain discount accretion) and
are not payable until such amounts are received in cash. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $1,229,032 of incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income, of which $0 was waived. As of
September 30, 2015, $1,101,891 of such incentive fees were currently payable to the Adviser of which $401,807 of pre-incentive fees incurred by us were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK and certain discount accretion) and are not
payable until such amounts are received in cash.    The realized gains incentive fee consists of fees related to both realized gains and
unrealized gains. As of September 30, 2016, there was no realized gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. As of September 30, 2015, there was no realized gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser under the
Advisory Agreement.    With respect to the incentive fee expense accrual relating to the unrealized gains incentive fee, GAAP requires that
the realized gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation in the calculation, as a realized gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized
appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement.

  The Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other
person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the
Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Adviser.    Prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC on
February 5, 2014, no base or incentive management fees were due and payable.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our
portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.     Recent Developments
    On November 9, 2016, we entered into a 2.5 year, $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  New Revolving
Financing ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citibank ), which is secured by collateral consisting primarily of commercial loans and corporate bonds. The New Revolving Financing will expire on May 1, 2019.  
 Borrowings under the New Revolving Financing will generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.85%. Default interest rate
will be equal to the interest rate then in effect plus 2.00%. The New Revolving Financing requires the payment of an unused fee of 2.85% annually for any undrawn amounts below 75% of the New Revolving Financing, and 0.75% annually for any
undrawn amounts above 75% of the New Revolving Financing. Borrowings under the New Revolving Financing are based on a borrowing base. The New Revolving Financing generally requires payment of interest on a quarterly basis. All outstanding
principal is due upon maturity. The New Revolving Financing also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events.  
      40  

Table of Contents  

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk   
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 90.2% of our debt investments bore
interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. Floating rate investments
subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor.  
 Generally, we believe higher yielding assets such as those in our investment portfolio do not necessarily follow a linear interest rate
relationship and are less sensitive in price to interest rate changes than many other debt investments. Our investments in fixed rate assets are generally exposed to changes in value due to interest rate fluctuations, and our floating rate assets
are generally exposed to cash flow variability from fluctuation in rates. Consequently, our net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is exposed to risks related to interest rate fluctuations. Based on our current portfolio with
certain interest rate floors and our financing at September 30, 2016, a 1.00% increase in interest rates would increase our net interest income by approximately 2.7% and a 2.00% increase in interest rates would increase our net interest income
by approximately 8.6%. Variable-rate instruments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor and, in the case of investments in our portfolio, quarterly to a floor based on LIBOR, only if the floor exceeds the index.
Under these loans, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor.  
 Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for
changes in the credit markets, the size, credit quality or composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing, that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It
also does not adjust for the effect of the time lag between a change in the relevant interest rate index and the rate adjustment under the applicable loan. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from
the statement above.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 As of September 30, 2016, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of material information about us required to be included in periodic SEC filings.  
   (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
 Management did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
    PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.
From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under Part I,
Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

  SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT   
 THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT is entered into as of November 7, 2016 (this   Agreement  ), by and
among CM Finance Inc, a Maryland corporation (the   Company  ), CM Investment Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the   Adviser  ), Stifel Venture Corp., a Missouri corporation

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending
to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:    Section 1.  Definitions . As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings

Section 2.  Board Nomination .  
 (a) For so long as Stifel holds ownership interests in the Adviser (the   Adviser Interests  ) equal to at least 15%
(except as provided in Section 2(h)) of the total ownership interests in the Adviser (such time period, the   Stifel Nomination Period  ), Stifel shall have the right to designate in writing (the   Stifel Nominee
Notice  ) a Person (the   Stifel Nominee  ) to serve as a member of the Board. Subject to Section 2(c) and Section 2(h), upon receipt of the Stifel Nominee Notice, the Board shall nominate the Stifel Nominee to serve as a
member of the Board as part of the Company s slate of directors at each annual or special meeting of the stockholders (the   Stockholders  ) in which the term of any Stifel Nominee will expire and of the Company (or, if
permitted, by any action by written consent of the Stockholders) at or by which directors of the Company are to be elected during the Stifel Nomination Period, and recommend that the Stockholders vote to elect the Stifel Nominee at each such meeting
or by such written consent.                    (b) Subject
to Section 2(f), vacancies arising through the death, resignation or removal of the Stifel Nominee who was elected or appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 2, may be filled by the Board only with a Stifel Nominee, and the director so
chosen shall hold office until the next election or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2, in the event that Stifel
does not designate a Stifel Nominee to fill any vacancy arising through the death, resignation or removal of the Stifel Nominee who was elected or appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 2, the Board may reduce the size of the Board pursuant
to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to eliminate any such vacancy.    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 2, Stifel shall not be entitled to designate a Person as a nominee to the Board if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company reasonably determines in writing (which determination shall set forth the reasonable grounds
for such determination) that such Person would not be qualified under any applicable law, rule or regulation to serve as a director of the Company; provided, that in such event, Stifel shall be entitled to designate another Person as the Stifel
Nominee and the provisions of Section 2 shall apply to such alternate Person. Only the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company shall have the right to object to any Stifel Nominee.  
 (d) During the Stifel Nomination Period, the Company shall notify Stifel in writing of the date on which proxy materials are expected to be
mailed by the Company in connection with an election of directors at an annual or special meeting of the Stockholders that includes the election of the Stifel Nominee at least 45 days prior to such expected mailing date. Following receipt of such
Company notice, Stifel shall deliver a Stifel Nominee Notice setting forth (i) the name and address of the Stifel Nominee and (ii) the information required for director nominees under Items 401, 403 and 404 of Regulation S-K under the federal
securities laws. The Company shall provide Stifel with a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on any portion of the proxy materials relating to the Stifel Nominee and the rights and obligations provided under this Agreement and
to discuss any such comments with the Company. The Company shall include Stifel s reasonable comments in the proxy materials relating to such matters. The  
      2  

Company shall notify Stifel of any opposition to a Stifel Nominee sufficiently in advance of the date on which such proxy materials are to be mailed by the Company in connection with such
election of directors so as to enable Stifel to propose a replacement Stifel Nominee, if necessary, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  
 (e) In the event the Stockholders fail to elect or consent to a Stifel Nominee in accordance with the preceding sentence, (i) Stifel shall
designate another Person as the Stifel Nominee and the provisions of Section 2 shall apply to such alternate Person and (ii) the Company shall promptly appoint the Stifel Nominee to any such vacancy on the Board created by the Stockholders failure
to elect or consent to a Stifel Nominee. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to nominate or appoint a Stifel Nominee to the Board of Directors of the Company if the Stockholders fail to elect or consent to such
Stifel Nominee.    (f) In the event that Stifel ceases to have the right to designate a Person to serve as a director pursuant to this
Section 2, Stifel shall use its best efforts to cause the applicable Stifel Nominee to resign immediately.    (g) The Company agrees that at
all times during the Stifel Nomination Period (i) subject to applicable legal requirements, the Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation shall accommodate, be subject to, and shall not in any way conflict with, Stifel s rights and obligations

on the Board pursuant to this Section 2, the Board may reduce the size of the Board to eliminate any vacancies on the Board as provided in Section 2(b). The Company further agrees that it shall not enter into any agreements or
understandings with any Stockholders (other than agreements or understandings equally applicable to all Stockholders) without prior notice to Stifel; provided, that the Company shall provide to Stifel (x) substantially final copies of all
documentation relating to such agreements or understandings no later than five (5) business days prior to the signing of such documentation and (y) fully executed copies of such documentation promptly following their execution.  
 (h) During the Stifel Nomination Period, in the event that (i) the Board has reduced the size of the Board to eliminate a vacancy arising
through the death, resignation or removal of the Stifel Nominee and/or the failure of Stifel to designate a Stifel Nominee in accordance with Section 2(b), and (ii) Stifel subsequently provides a Stifel Nominee Notice in accordance with Section
2(a), not later than the 90th day from the Company s receipt of a Stifel Nominee Notice in accordance with Section 2(a), the Board shall increase the size of the Board to create a vacancy for a Stifel Nominee to be nominated to fill and,
subject to Section 2(c), the Company shall appoint the Stifel Nominee to the Board to fill such vacancy.    (i) The Stifel Nomination
Period shall not terminate in the event Stifel s ownership of Adviser Interests falls below 15% as a result of a transfer of Adviser Interests made on a pro rata basis with all members of the Adviser. In the event of such a pro rata
transfer, the 15% threshold set forth the definition of  Stifel Nomination Period  shall be deemed reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage by which Stifel s ownership of Adviser Interests was reduced in such pro rata transfer
(by way of example only, if all existing members transfer 10% of their Adviser Interests to a third party, the 15% threshold shall become 13.5%).

  Manner of Payment       

3.6(a) 
 The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or otherwise) or under any Support Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on
the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10043, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
in any Support Document. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient through its Payment Account promptly following receipt thereof.    

(b) 
 If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon
shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments by the Borrower hereunder or under any Support Document shall be made in USD.    
      Page 19  

(c) 
 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.    

(d) 
 Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each payment or prepayment of principal of the Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective portions
of the unpaid principal amount of the Loan held by them; (ii) each payment of interest on any Loan by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on their respective portions of such
Loan then due and payable to the Lenders; and (iii) each commitment fee or commitment reduction fee payable by the Borrower under Section 3.2(b), 3.2(c) or 3.2(d) shall be made for account of the Initial Lender.    

(e) 
 Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from the Loans, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. The entries made in such
accounts maintained shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;  provided  that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not
in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans, and to pay interest thereon, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.        

(f) 
 Any Lender may request that the portion of the Loans owing to such Lender be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the
order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the portion of the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall
at all times (including after assignment pursuant hereto) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered
assigns).    
      Page 20  

(g) 
 If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any portion of the Loans owing to such Lender resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion thereof then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the amounts owing to the other
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with paragraph (d) above;  provided  that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed
to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any portion of the Loans to
any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.        

(h) 
 Any Lender may change the Payment Account for receiving payments under this Agreement by giving notice of the new Payment Account to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior to the
first scheduled date for the payment to which such change applies.       Collection Accounts; Application of Proceeds; Priorities of Payment

received by the Borrower that are not required hereunder to be deposited into the Principal Collection Account. The Borrower may from time to time (other than on a Payment Date) invest collected funds standing to the credit of the Interest

date of such investment.

on the next succeeding Payment Date as provided in this Section 3.7(e) or in Section 3.7(g).    (i) Subject to Section 3.7(f),

(other than paragraph (1) thereof) that such claims shall be subordinate and junior to the claims of each Person in accordance with any prior paragraph of Section 3.7(e) or 3.7(g), in each case, to the extent and in the manner set forth in
Section 3.7(e) or 3.7(g), as the case may be.       Taxes       

3.8(a) 
   All payments under this Agreement for account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender will be made without any
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature (a   Tax  ) unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If the Borrower is required to withhold or deduct for or on account of any Tax in respect of this Agreement for account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower
will: (1) promptly notify the affected payee of such requirement; (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted     
      Page 25  

or withheld promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed; (3) promptly forward to the
affected payee (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if it is not the affected payee) an official receipt (or a certified copy) evidencing such payment to such authorities; and (4) unless such Tax is an Excluded Tax pay to such payee such
additional amount (an   Additional Amount  ) as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by such payee (free and clear of all Taxes other than Excluded Taxes, whether assessed against the Borrower or such payee) will
equal the full amount such payee would have received in respect of this Agreement had no such deduction or withholding been required;  provided  that the Borrower will not be required to pay any Additional Amount with respect to any Tax that
is:        

(i) 
 imposed other than by withholding;        

(ii) 
 an estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax;        

(iii) 
 imposed by reason of the failure of such payee, or beneficial owner of an interest in this Agreement if not such payee (after reasonable notice by such payee), to provide the Borrower on a timely basis, with any forms,
certificates or other documentary evidence that is required to avoid the imposition of such Tax, including any such form, certificate or other documentary evidence as required pursuant to FATCA;    

(iv) 
 imposed by reason of any change in any Payment Account pursuant to Section 3.6 not agreed to by the Borrower at the time of such change; or    

(v) 
 imposed by reason of any combination of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv);    
  provided , however, that no Foreign Lender shall be entitled to receive an Additional Amount unless such Foreign Lender is entitled to an
exemption from Tax under either (x) the laws of the United States of America or (y) a tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement. Such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the
Borrower such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding.  

(b) 
 If a Change in Tax Law results, or would result upon the passage of time, in a payment of an Additional Amount to a Foreign Lender, then such Foreign Lender shall take such steps as may be reasonably available to
it to mitigate the effects of such Change in Tax Law (which shall include efforts to rebook this Agreement at another lending office or through another branch or an affiliate of the Foreign Lender),  provided  that such Foreign Lender
shall not be required to take any step that would be materially disadvantageous to its business or operations (as determined by the Foreign Lender in its reasonable discretion). If the Foreign Lender does not promptly take the steps necessary
to avoid the need for Additional Payments, the Borrower shall have the right to redomicile (in consultation with the Initial Lender) in a jurisdiction that would not give rise to a withholding obligation.    
      Page 26  

(c) 
 If the Borrower makes a payment of any Additional Amount and the affected payee receives a refund, credit or other tax benefit that is attributable to the Tax in respect of which the Additional Amount is paid, such
payee will promptly upon receipt of such refund, credit or benefit, pay to the Borrower such amount as will in such payee s sole determination, leave such payee no better or worse off than if no payment of the Additional Amounts had been
required;  provided  that nothing herein will limit the ability of such payee to prepare its tax returns in the manner it so determines in its sole discretion.    

(d) 
 The Borrower will pay any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the Borrower or in respect of its execution or performance of this Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organized, managed and controlled,
or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located (  Stamp Tax Jurisdiction  ) and will indemnify the affected payee (and, to the extent it has made any
payment on behalf of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent) against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon such payee or in respect of such payee s execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not also a
Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to such payee.       Alternate Rate of Interest   
 3.9 If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period:      

(a) 
 the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period; or    

(b) 
 the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that LIBOR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining their respective portions of the
Loans for such Interest Period;        then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as promptly
as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Effective Rate on each day plus 5.85%;  provided  that, for the purposes of determining whether LIBOR for such Interest Period will or will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining their respective
portions of the Loans for such Interest Period, no Lender shall give the advice referred to in clause (b) above unless such Lender is giving such advice generally under credit or other loan documentation having provisions similar to this
Section 3.9 with respect to borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower.    
      Page 27  

Increased Costs       

(i) 
 impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
reflected in LIBOR); or        

(ii) 
 impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or the portion of the Loans made or maintained by such Lender;    
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their respective portions of the
Loans or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise, but excluding increased costs or reductions in the amount of any sum received or receivable resulting from
(1) an Excluded Tax or (2) a Tax to the extent Additional Amounts are required to be paid under Section 3.8(a) (or would be but for clauses (iii) or (iv) of the first proviso to Section 3.8(a))), then the Borrower will
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.      

(b) 
 If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the portion of the Loans made or maintained by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered.        

(c) 
 A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. No Lender shall be entitled to require the payment of any compensation specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section unless such Lender is
generally seeking the payment of similar additional amounts from similarly situated borrowers in comparable credit facilities to the extent such Lender is entitled thereunder to do so. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.        

(d) 
   Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation;  provided  that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six
months prior to the date     
      Page 28  

that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor;  provided 
further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the  six-month  period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.        

(e) 
 If a Debt Obligation Bankruptcy Event or Debt Obligation Failure to Pay Event occurs with respect to any Debt Obligation, the Administrative Agent may, by notice to the Borrower, adjust the Advance Rate with respect to
such Debt Obligation. Such notice shall specify the adjusted Advance Rate and the date on which such adjustment is to become effective (which shall be not less than three Business Days after the date of such notice).    
  Break Funding Payments     3.11 In the event that
(a) the payment of any principal of the Loans is made on any date other than a Payment Date (including as a result of an Event of Default) or (b) the Borrower fails to borrow any Loan or a portion thereof on the related Borrowing Date
after giving notice of such borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a
deposit equal to the principal amount of its portion of the Loan(s) for the period from the date of such payment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan(s) (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, equal to its portion of
the amount of such borrowing for the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period over (b) the amount of interest that
such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other
banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. For purposes of determining compensation payable by the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 3.11, each Interest Period will be determined without giving effect to any adjustment to the length thereof that may be provided for in the Debt Obligation Agreement as a result of any unscheduled payment of principal.  
  Right of Set-Off     3.12 The Borrower agrees that, in
addition to (and without limitation of) any right of  set-off  that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled, at its option,
to offset amounts owing by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, to the Borrower, in USD or in any other currency (irrespective of the place of payment or booking office of the obligation and regardless of whether such amounts
are then due to the Borrower), against any amount payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Lender,  
      Page 29  

as the case may be, under this Agreement that is not paid when due. For this purpose, any amount owing by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the Borrower may be converted by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, into the currency in which the amount payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement is denominated at the rate of exchange at
which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.  
  Contractual Currency         3.13 To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the currency in which a payment is required by this Agreement is to be made by the Borrower (the   Contractual Currency  ) is rendered:  

(a) 
 for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement; or        

(b) 
 in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in the foregoing clause (a),    
 the recipient of such payment, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which the recipient of such payment is entitled pursuant to the judgment or
order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the Borrower the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by the recipient of such payment as a consequence of sums being paid in such other currency if such shortfall arises or
results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which the recipient of such
payment is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by
the recipient of such payment. The term  rate of exchange  includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.  
 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the indemnities in this Section constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement and any related document, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the recipient of such payment and will not be affected by judgment being
obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement or any related document. The Borrower hereby waives the right to invoke any defense of payment impossibility.

  A DMINISTRATIVE  A GENT      7.1
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the Support Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.    7.2 The Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  
 7.3 The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the Support Documents. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Potential Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the Support Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in
writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the Support Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice
thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any Support Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered  
      Page 41  

hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any Support Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Schedule I or
elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.    7.4 The
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed
or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel,
accountants or experts.    7.5 The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more
sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Each Lender by its execution and delivery of this Agreement agrees, as contemplated by the Security Agreement, that, in the event it shall hold any Eligible Investments referred to therein,
such Eligible Investments shall be held in the name and under the control of such Lender, and such Lender shall hold such Eligible Investments as a collateral sub agent for the Administrative Agent thereunder. The Borrower, by its execution and
delivery of this Agreement, hereby consents to the foregoing.    7.6 Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, after prior written consent from the Borrower (not to be
unreasonably withheld and not to be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and with the prior written consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld and not to be required
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York City or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
 
      Page 42  

from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section and Section 8.1 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.    7.7 Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any Support Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.    7.8 Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.4(a) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Support Documents, provided
that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Support Documents) release any collateral or otherwise terminate any Lien under any Support Document providing for collateral
security, agree to additional obligations being secured by such collateral security (unless the Lien for such additional obligations shall be junior to the Lien in favor of the other obligations secured by such Support Document, in which event the
Administrative Agent may consent to such junior Lien provided that it obtains the consent of the Required Lenders thereto), alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Agreement,
except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, to release any Lien covering property that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder.  
  M ISCELLANEOUS       Indemnification;
Expenses         8.1 The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons
and each of their respective officers, directors and employees (each such Person being called an   Indemnitee  ) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or under any other Transaction Document, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or any Support Document or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Document, (ii) the Loans or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) any actual or       
      Page 43  

prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  provided  that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.    The Borrower shall pay (i) all
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities
provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection
with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including in connection with any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iii) and all costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest
contemplated by the Security Agreement or any other document referred to therein.      To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under any of the two preceding paragraphs of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender s pro rata share (determined in accordance with
Section 3.6(d) with respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans as of the date of the request for such indemnification) of such unpaid amount;  provided  that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent Lender in its capacity as such.    
  Waiver; No Consequential Damages     8.2 No failure on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee,
on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any Support Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the  
      Page 44  

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the Support Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.  
  Notices     8.3 All notices and other communications
provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or the equivalent (return receipt requested) or sent by facsimile transmission, as
follows:      

(c) 
 if to a Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.      Any
party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto (or, in the case of any such change by a Lender, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent). All
notices and other communications given to any party hereto shall be deemed to be effective (i) if in writing and delivered by hand or overnight courier service, on the date it is delivered; (ii) if sent by facsimile transmission, on the
date that transmission is received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and will not be met by a transmission report generated by the sender s
facsimile machine); or (iii) if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is delivered or its delivery is attempted, unless the date of that delivery (or
attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Business Day or that communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed
given and effective on the first following day that is a Business Day.    Notices and other communications to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion,
agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such  
      Page 45  

procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall
be deemed received upon the sender s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the  return receipt requested  function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices
or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication
is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient.     Amendments; Successors and
Assigns; Transfers; Replacement       

8.4(a) 
 Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;  provided  that no such agreement shall (i) reduce the principal amount of the Loans or the rate of interest thereon without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (ii) postpone the Maturity Date or any other scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of the Loans or any interest thereon without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) alter the manner in which
payments or prepayments of principal, interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders without the written consent of each Lender, (iv) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of the term
 Required Lenders  or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent
of each Lender, or (v) release any Collateral without the written consent of each Lender; and  provided  further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.        

(b) 
 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Lender that is not in accordance with this Section shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and any indemnitees referred to herein) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.    
      Page 46  

(c) 
 Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement), subject to the requirements that:    

(i) 
 except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the amount of any partial assignment by an assigning Lender shall not be less than USD5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consent,  provided  that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;    

(ii) 
 each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement;    

(iii) 
 the assignee shall have certified to the Borrower that it is a  qualified purchaser  (within the meaning given to such term in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act);    

(iv) 
 the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;        

(v) 
 the Borrower shall have consented to such assignment if the assignee is not already a Lender or an Affiliate of the Lender; and        

(vi) 
 notwithstanding the foregoing, the Initial Lender shall not assign its commitment to make advances pursuant to Section 2.1.        

(d) 
 Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (e) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto, but shall
continue to be entitled to the rights referred to in Sections 3.8, 3.10 and 8.1). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) below.        

(e) 
   The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and respective principal amounts of the portions of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   Register  ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
    
      Page 47  

Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee s completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be
effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (e).        

(f) 
 Any Lender may, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a   Participant  ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement;  provided  that
(i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided  that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 8.4(a) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.8 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) above; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any
greater amount pursuant to Section 3.8 than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred. To the
extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.9 as though it were a Lender,  provided  such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.8 as though it were a Lender hereunder. Each
Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the   Participant Register  ); provided, however, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to
any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Support Document) except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan letter of credit or other obligation is in  registered form  under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
   
      Page 48  

(g) 
 Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve
Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;  provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute
any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.        

(h) 
 Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in the portion of the Loans held by it hereunder to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries
without the prior consent of each Lender.        

(i) 
 The Initial Lender hereby certifies (and agrees with) to the Borrower that the Initial Lender is a  qualified purchaser  (within the meaning given to such term in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment
Company Act).        

(j) 
 Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the Debt Obligation Agreement with respect to all information and documentation in relation to the Debt Obligation
or an Obligor thereon delivered hereunder to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that such information may include material non-public information concerning an
obligor on the Debt Obligation or its securities and agrees to use such information in accordance with applicable law, including Federal and State securities laws.

such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over the Borrower. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the
Administrative Agent or any Lender from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction, nor will the bringing of Proceedings by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings by the

      Page 49  

act as such, the Borrower will within 30 days appoint a substitute Process Agent located in the State of New York and give notice of such appointment to the Administrative Agent and each Lender.
The Borrower irrevocably consents to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner
permitted by law.

sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or
after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.       Limited Recourse; Non-Petition   

8.6(a) 
 The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement are limited recourse obligations of the Borrower payable solely from the Collateral and, following the enforcement and realization of the Collateral and the
application thereof in accordance with this Agreement and the Security Agreement, any claims of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be extinguished and shall not revive. None of the Borrower s shareholders, officers, members and
directors shall be liable for any of the obligations or agreements or breach thereof or any covenant, representation or warranty of the Borrower under this Agreement, and no recourse or action may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to
any of the obligations or agreements or breach thereof or any covenant, representation or warranty of the Borrower under this Agreement against any of the Borrower s shareholders, officers, members or directors, except that the foregoing will
not (i) prevent recourse to the Collateral for the sums due or to become due under any security, instrument or agreement which is part of the Collateral, (ii) relieve any Person from (A) any liability for any unpaid consideration for
stock, any unpaid capital contribution or any unpaid capital call or other similar obligation or (B) any obligation, agreement or liability under any agreement or instrument other than this Agreement or (iii) limit service of process on
the Borrower by delivery of notice on its behalf to the Borrower.

Exhibit 10.3   
  COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT   
 This Collateral Management Agreement (this   Agreement  ) is made as of November 9, 2016, by and between CM Finance SPV
LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the   Borrower  ), and CM Investment Partners, L.L.C. a Delaware limited liability company (the   Collateral Manager  ).  
 RECITALS:    The Borrower intends to purchase one
or more Term Loans and Bonds outstanding under the respective Debt Obligation Agreements referred to herein (the Term Loans and Bonds so acquired, collectively, the   Debt Obligations   and, together with the Eligible Investments, the
  Collateral  ).    The Borrower intends to borrow Loans pursuant to a Loan Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among the
Borrower, the financial institutions and other lenders from time to time party hereto as Lenders (the   Lenders  ) and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, together
with its successors in such capacity, the   Administrative Agent  ) (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the   Loan Agreement  ).  
 The Borrower wishes to use the proceeds of Loans hereunder to finance a portion of the cost of purchasing the Debt Obligations.  
 The Borrower has requested that Citibank, N.A., as Initial Lender (the   Initial Lender  ), make the Loans to the Borrower, and
the Initial Lender is willing to make the Loans to the Borrower, all on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  
 Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the Loan Agreement;  
 Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Borrower has pledged the Collateral to the Administrative Agent as security for the Loans;  
 The Borrower wishes to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which the Collateral Manager agrees to perform, on behalf of the Borrower,
certain duties with respect to the Collateral securing the Loans in the manner and on the terms set forth herein and to provide such additional services as are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Loan Agreement; and  
 The Collateral Manager has the capacity to provide the services required hereby and is prepared to perform such services upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows:      

1. 
  Definitions       In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any term defined
herein and any term defined in the Loan Agreement, the defined term as set forth in the Loan Agreement shall govern.  
      1  

Change-in-Control   means an event that will occur if any Person or
 group  acquires any  beneficial ownership  (as such terms are defined under Rule 13d-3 of, and Regulation 13D under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), either directly or indirectly, of any equity interests or any
interest convertible into any equity interests in the Collateral Manager having more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power for the election of managers or directors of the Collateral Manager under ordinary circumstances.  
   Collateral Management Fee   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 2(j).  

2. 
  General Duties of the Collateral Manager       Subject to and in accordance with the terms of
the Loan Agreement and this Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall provide services to the Borrower as follows:    (a) The Collateral
Manager agrees to supervise and direct the investment and reinvestment of the Collateral, and shall perform on behalf of the Borrower the duties that have been expressly delegated to the Collateral Manager in this Agreement and in the Loan Agreement
and Support Documents (and the Collateral Manager shall have no obligation to perform any other duties under the Loan Agreement or otherwise) and, to the extent necessary or appropriate to perform such duties, the Collateral Manager shall have the
power to execute and deliver all necessary and appropriate documents and instruments on behalf of the Borrower with respect thereto.    (b)
The Collateral Manager shall (i) select all the Debt Obligations satisfying all the applicable criteria set forth in the Loan Agreement and which shall be acquired by the Borrower and pledged to the Security Agent pursuant to the Security
Agreement and (ii) facilitate the acquisition, disposition and settlement of the Debt Obligations by the Borrower in accordance with the Loan Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Account Control Agreement, including the delivery of
Collateral in accordance with the Security Agreement.    (c) The Collateral Manager shall monitor the Collateral, on behalf of the Borrower,
on an ongoing basis and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Borrower all reports, schedules and other data which the Borrower are required to prepare, deliver or furnish under the Loan Agreement and the Support Documents, in
the form and containing all information required thereby and on or before the date required under the Loan Agreement or the Support Documents, as applicable, and to deliver them to the parties entitled thereto under the Loan Agreement or the Support
Documents, as applicable. The Collateral Manager shall, on behalf of the Borrower, be responsible for obtaining, to the extent practicable, any information concerning whether a Debt Obligation is a Bond, a Specified Debt Obligation, an Excess
Concentration Debt Obligation or a Debt Obligation as to which a Debt Obligation Event, Debt Obligation Bankruptcy Event and/or a Debt Obligation Failure to Pay Event has occurred.  
      2  

(d) The Collateral Manager shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish officer s
certificates, certificates relating to the Borrowing Base, and notices in each case, as may be required under the Loan Agreement, including providing any certifications, and the Collateral Manager shall have the power to execute and deliver all
necessary and appropriate documents and instruments on behalf of the Borrower with respect thereto.    (e) The Collateral Manager shall
direct the Collateral Administrator to: (i) make payments on behalf of the Borrower under the Loan Agreement and the Support Documents, and (ii) deposit into the Interest Collection Account and the Principal Collection Account, as
applicable, proceeds from the Debt Obligations, in each case, when required under the Loan Agreement.    (f) The Collateral Manager shall
maintain and cause to be maintained all the documentation evidencing the Debt Obligations held in the Custodial Account (as defined in the Account Control Agreement) for the benefit of the Security Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured
Parties (as defined in the Security Agreement).    (g) The Collateral Manager may, in its sole discretion, subject to and in accordance with
the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the Support Documents, and this Agreement and prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, direct the Security Agent in writing to take the following actions with respect to any Debt Obligations
(collectively, the   Managed Assets  ), as applicable:    (i) retain such Managed Asset;  
 (ii) sell or otherwise dispose of such Managed Asset in the open market or otherwise;  
 (iii) acquire, as security for the Loans in substitution for or in addition to any one or more Managed Assets included in the
Collateral, one or more additional Managed Assets;    (iv) if applicable, tender such Managed Asset if such Managed Asset is
subject to a tender offer, voluntary redemption, exchange offer, conversion or other similar action (each, an   Offer    
 (v) if applicable, consent to any proposed amendment, modification or waiver pursuant to an Offer;  
 (vi) retain or dispose of any securities or other property (other than Cash) received pursuant to an Offer;  
 (vii) waive any default with respect to any defaulted Debt Obligation;  
 (viii) vote to accelerate the maturity of any defaulted Debt Obligation;  
 (ix) amend, waive, consent, or vote with respect to any Managed Asset;  
      3  

(x) exercise any other rights or remedies with respect to any Managed Asset and
as provided in the related Debt Obligation Agreement including without limitation the negotiation of any workout or restructuring and the acceptance of any security or other consideration issued in a plan of reorganization, bankruptcy or other
proceeding involving any thereof, or take any other action consistent with the terms of the Loan Agreement which it reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Borrower; and  
 (xi) exercise any other rights or remedies with respect to such Managed Asset.  
 (h) Except as expressly otherwise permitted in Section 6(e) and by the Loan Agreement, the Collateral Manager shall cause any purchase or
sale of any Managed Asset to be effected on an arm s length basis.    (i) In connection with taking or omitting any action under the
Loan Agreement or this Agreement, the Collateral Manager may consult with counsel and may rely in good faith on the advice of such counsel or any opinion of counsel selected in good faith with reasonable care.  
 (j) The Borrower shall pay to the Collateral Manager, for services rendered under this Agreement, the Collateral Management Fee in an amount
equal to 0.15% per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) of the sum of aggregate outstanding amount of the Debt Obligations and Eligible Investments at the beginning of the Interest Period relating
to such Payment Date, payable in arrears on each Payment Date, to the extent of funds available for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.7(i)(3) of the Loan Agreement except that no such amount shall be payable to the Collateral Manager if
irrevocably waived by the Collateral Manager by written notice to the Borrower, the Collateral Administrator and the Administrative Agent.  
 The Collateral Manager is hereby granted, and shall have, full power to take all actions and execute and deliver all necessary and appropriate
documents and instruments on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with this Agreement. The Collateral Manager hereby accepts and agrees to perform all of the duties delegated to it under this Agreement.  

3. 
  No Joint Venture       Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a joint venture or
partnership between the parties with respect to the arrangements set forth in this Agreement. For all purposes herein, the Collateral Manager shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, unless otherwise provided herein or specifically
authorized by the Borrower, from time to time, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Borrower.      

4. 
  Brokerage       The Collateral Manager shall effect all purchases and sales of securities in
a manner consistent with the principles of best execution, taking into account net price (including commissions) and execution capability and other services which the broker may provide. In this regard, the Collateral Manager may effect transactions
which cause the Borrower to pay a commission in excess of a commission which another broker would have charged; provided,  
      4  

however, that the Collateral Manager shall have first determined that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage, research, performance measurement service and other
services performed by that broker.      
   The Collateral Manager shall be responsible for the ordinary expenses incurred
in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;  provided ,  however , that any extraordinary expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager in the performance of such obligations, including, but not limited to: (i) any
reasonable expenses incurred by it (whether for its own account or paid for or advanced by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower) to employ outside lawyers or consultants reasonably necessary in connection with the acquisition, holding,
monitoring, marking to market, enforcement, amendment, default, evaluation, transfer, workout, restructuring, bankruptcy or disposition of any Debt Obligation, (ii) any reasonable expenses incurred by it in obtaining advice from counsel with
respect to its obligations under this Agreement and the provisions of the Loan Agreement applicable to it, and (iii) any other commercially reasonable   out-of-pocket  
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, holding, monitoring, marking to market, enforcement, amendment, default, evaluation, transfer, workout, restructuring, bankruptcy or disposition of any Debt Obligation, including,
without limitation, any and all rating agency expenses, news and quotation subscription expenses, travel costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Manager or its officers (on a pro rata basis) in connection with the performance of the Collateral
Manager s obligations under this Agreement and of software and services costs for record keeping and fund administration, due diligence costs, legal, tax, accounting, appraisal, and any rating agency costs to the extent not paid directly by the
Borrower and any extraordinary expenses of any nature or other unusual matters, shall be reimbursed by the Borrower to the extent funds credited to the Collection Account are available therefor in accordance with and subject to the limitations
contained in the Loan Agreement. Other than as stated above, the Borrower will bear, and will pay directly in accordance with the Loan Agreement, all other costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the organization, operation or
liquidation of the Borrower.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, or any Support Document, the
Collateral Manager agrees for the benefit of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the Collateral Administrator that any obligations of the Borrower to pay any amounts to the Collateral Manager under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, this Section 5, Section 2(j) and Section 9 hereof) shall be subordinate and junior to the obligations of the Borrower to pay amounts to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the
Collateral Administrator when due under the Loan Agreement and the relevant Support Document(s) in accordance with Section 3.7 of the Loan Agreement, and all amounts due to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the
Collateral Administrator in accordance therewith shall be paid in full in cash or, to the extent the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent or the Collateral Administrator, as applicable, consents, other than in cash before any
payment or distribution is made to the Collateral Manager. The Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the Collateral Administrator shall constitute express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement for purposes of this
Section 5.  
      5  

6. 
  Services to Other Companies or Accounts; Conflicts of Interest       (a) The members,
Affiliates and associates of the Collateral Manager are in no way prohibited from, and intend to, spend substantial business time in connection with other businesses or activities, including, but not limited to, managing investments, advising or
managing entities other than the Borrower, whose investment objectives are the same as or overlap with those of the Borrower, participating in actual or potential investments of the Borrower providing consulting, merger and acquisition, structuring
or financial advisory services, including with respect to actual, contemplated or potential investments of the Borrower, or acting as a director, officer or creditors  committee member of, adviser to, or participant in, any corporation,
partnership, trust or other business entity. Such Affiliates or associates may, and expect to, receive fees or other compensation from third parties for any of these activities, which fees will be for the benefit of their own account and not the
Borrower. These fees can relate to actual, contemplated or potential investments of the Borrower and may be payable by entities in which the Borrower directly or indirectly, has invested or contemplates investing.  
 (b) In addition, the members, Affiliates and associates of the Collateral Manager may manage Affiliates of the Borrower (including, but not
limited to, other funds, investment vehicles, accounts or advisory clients of the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates, collectively the   Other CM Funds  )). The investment policies, fee arrangements and circumstances of the
Borrower may differ from such Other CM Funds. For example, the Borrower may desire to retain an asset at the same time that one or more Other CM Funds desire to sell it. Similarly, the Other CM Funds which are in a liquidation phase may take
priority as to sales of investments in which the Borrower is also an investor. These procedures could in certain circumstances adversely affect the price paid or received by the Borrower or the size of the position purchased or sold by the Borrower.
   (c) Although the Borrower intends to operate so that the Debt Obligations are not  plan assets  under ERISA, some of the Other
CM Funds may hold or will hold  plan assets  subject to ERISA. For those plan assets, certain members, Affiliates and/or associates of the Collateral Manager are classified as  fiduciaries  under ERISA. ERISA imposes certain
general and specific responsibilities and restrictions on fiduciaries with respect to plan assets. As a result, the Collateral Manager may adopt certain procedures to address other conflicts in order to satisfy ERISA requirements, if applicable. The
foregoing procedures could in certain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by the Borrower or the size of the position purchased or sold by the Borrower (including prohibiting the Borrower from purchasing a position) or may
limit the rights that the Borrower may exercise with respect to an investment.    (d) Members, Affiliates and associates of the Collateral
Manager may have the ability, under certain circumstances, to take certain actions that would be inconsistent with the objectives of the Borrower. In such circumstances, the Collateral Manager and its members, Affiliates and associates will act in
good faith and in a manner believed by them to be equitable,  provided  that the Collateral Manager and its members, Affiliates and associates may adopt certain procedures to address other conflicts in order to satisfy ERISA requirements, if
applicable. The foregoing procedures could in certain circumstances adversely affect the price  
      6  

paid or received by the Borrower or the size of the position purchased or sold by the Borrower (including prohibiting the Borrower from purchasing a position) or may limit the rights that the
Borrower may exercise with respect to an investment.    (e) The Collateral Manager shall not direct the Borrower to purchase any Debt
Obligation for inclusion in the Collateral directly from the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates as principal or any account or portfolio for which Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates serve as investment advisor, or direct the
Administrative Agent to sell directly any Debt Obligation to the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates as principal or any account or portfolio for which the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates serve as investment advisor, unless the
Collateral Manager shall have certified to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with respect to each such transaction that (i) such transaction will be consummated on terms prevailing in the market, (ii) the terms of such transaction
are substantially as advantageous to the Borrower as the terms the Borrower would obtain in a comparable arm s length transaction with a  non-Affiliate,  and (iii) such transaction complies with the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the   Advisers Act  ), to the extent applicable. In accordance with the foregoing, the Collateral Manager may, in one or more transactions, effect client cross-transactions where the
Collateral Manager causes a transaction to be effected between the Borrower and another collateralized debt obligation vehicle, collateralized loan obligation vehicle, fund or another investment vehicle or account managed or advised by it or one or
more of its Affiliates, but neither it nor the Affiliate will receive any commission or similar fee in connection with such cross-transaction. If consent of the Borrower to any such transaction is required under the Advisers Act, the Collateral
Manager will obtain the prior written, informed consent of the Borrower. In addition, with the prior authorization of the Borrower, which may be revoked at any time, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross-transactions where it or any of
its Affiliates acts as broker for the Borrower and for the other party to the transaction, to the extent permitted under applicable law.  
 (f) The Collateral Manager shall not direct the Borrower to purchase any Debt Obligation for inclusion in the Collateral if the obligor on
such Debt Obligation is the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates or any other fund or account managed by the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates.      

7. 
  Standard of Care       The Collateral Manager shall comply with all the terms and conditions
of the Loan Agreement specifically made applicable to the Collateral Manager as specified therein affecting the duties and functions that have been delegated to it thereunder and hereunder and, subject to Section 8 of this Agreement, shall
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder in good faith and with reasonable care, using a degree of skill and attention no less than that which the Collateral Manager exercises with respect to assets comparable to the Debt Obligations, if
any, that it manages for itself and exercises with respect to assets comparable to the Debt Obligations that it manages for others, and in a manner which the Collateral Manager reasonably believes to be consistent with practices and procedures
followed by prudent institutional managers of national standing relating to assets of the nature and character of the Debt Obligations, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement and/or the Loan Agreement. To the extent not
inconsistent with the foregoing, the Collateral Manager shall follow its customary standards, policies and procedures in performing its duties under the Loan Agreement and hereunder.  
      7  

8. 
  Limitation of Liability       None of the Collateral Manager, its Affiliates, any officer,
director, partner, member, employee, or stockholder of any of such Persons or any other Person that serves or provides advisory services and resources at the request of the Collateral Manager on behalf of the Borrower as an officer, director,
partner, member, employee or agent of any other entity (each, an   Indemnified Person  ) shall be liable to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower for damages arising from any action taken or omitted to be taken by such
Person or for damages arising from any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or other Person with respect to the Borrower; unless such damages are the result of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
by such Indemnified Person. The Collateral Manager shall indemnify and hold harmless the Borrower and its Affiliates in the case of any damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Manager, unless such actions
or the damages result from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (other than the Collateral Manager).      

9. 
  Indemnification       (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, whether or not matured or unmatured or whether or not asserted or brought due to contractual or other restrictions (including legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage or liability), joint or several (collectively,   Losses  ), to which an Indemnified Person may become subject by reason of any acts
or omissions or any alleged acts or omissions arising out of such Indemnified Person s or any other Indemnified Person s activities in connection with the conduct of the business or affairs of the Borrower and/or a Debt Obligation
(including in connection with this Agreement), or caused by or arising out of or in connection with, the incurrence of the Loans, unless such Loss results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9(a) are limited recourse obligations of the Borrower payable solely out of the amounts credited to the Collection Account in accordance with
Section 3.7(i) of the Loan Agreement. Any indemnification rights provided for in this Section 9(a) shall be retained by any resigned or replaced Collateral Manager and by all former Indemnified Persons.  
 (b) Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person in defense or settlement of any claim that may be subject to a right of indemnification
hereunder may be advanced by the Borrower prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be determined ultimately that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder. The right of any Indemnified Person to the indemnification provided herein shall be cumulative of, and in addition to, any and all rights to which such Indemnified Person may otherwise
be entitled by contract or as a matter of law or equity and shall extend to such Indemnified Person s successors, assigns and legal representatives.  
      8  

(c) The indemnification rights provided for in this Section 9 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else herein, nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed as relieving any person for any liability (including liability under applicable U.S. federal securities laws
which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith), to the extent that such liability may not be waived under, or such indemnification would be in violation of, applicable law.  

10. 
  Term of Agreement; Survival of Certain Terms       (a) This Agreement shall become effective
on the date hereof. This Agreement shall continue in force until the first of the following occurs (i) the payment in full or redemption in whole of the Loans and the termination of the Loan Agreement in accordance with its terms; (ii) the
liquidation of the Debt Obligations and the final distribution of proceeds of such liquidation to the Lenders; or (iii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 10. Sections 8, 9 and 11 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.    (b) This Agreement may be terminated, and the Collateral Manager may be removed for cause, on
the thirtieth day after the date on which the Administrative Agent, delivers written notice, setting forth the cause of such removal, to the Collateral Manager. For purposes of determining  Cause  with respect to termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11, such term shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following events (each, a   Collateral Manager Termination Event  ):  
 (i) the Collateral Manager willfully violates or willfully breaches any material provision of this Agreement, the Loan
Agreement, or any Support Document to which it is a party (including, without limitation, any breach of a material representation, warranty or certification of the Collateral Manager hereunder or thereunder);

3.3 
  Limitation on Liability         

(a) 
   Neither Collateral Party shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Collateral Party shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, and neither Collateral Party shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers.
None of the Intermediary, the Collateral Administrator, any Affiliate of the Intermediary or the Collateral Administrator, or any officer, agent, stockholder, partner, member, director or employee of the Intermediary or the Collateral Administrator
shall have any liability, whether direct or indirect and whether in contract, tort or otherwise, (i) for any     
      3  

action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them hereunder or in connection herewith unless (A) such party willfully fails to follow written directions delivered to the Collateral Parties
in accordance with this Agreement or (B) there has been a final judicial determination that such act or omission was performed or omitted in bad faith or constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such party at the express direction of the Debtor and the Security Agent (acting solely at the direction of the Administrative Agent), or (iii) for any action taken or omitted to be taken by such party at the express
written direction of any Person reasonably believed by it to be entitled to give such direction in accordance with this Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Support Document. In addition, the Intermediary shall have no liability for making any
investment or reinvestment of any cash balance in the Accounts pursuant to an investment instruction complying with the terms of this Agreement. With the exception of this Agreement and the Security Agreement (and the provisions of the Loan
Agreement referred to therein), the Collateral Parties are not responsible for or chargeable with knowledge of any terms or conditions contained in any agreement referred to herein.    

(b) 
 Neither the Intermediary nor the Collateral Administrator shall be required to take any action that is contrary to applicable law or this Agreement or that will require it to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur financial liability.        

(c) 
 To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an
account. When an account is opened, the Intermediary will ask for information that will allow the Intermediary to identify relevant parties.        

(d) 
 Should any controversy arise between the undersigned with respect to this Agreement or with respect to the right to receive the Financial Assets, the Collateral Parties shall have the right to consult with counsel
and/or to institute a bill of interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties. If the Collateral Parties receive written evidence that a dispute has arisen with respect to the Financial Assets, the
Collateral Parties may deliver the Financial Assets to any court of competent jurisdiction and request such court to adjudicate the entitlement to such Financial Assets by interpleader or other legal proceeding. In respect of this paragraph, should
such actions be necessary, or should the Collateral Parties become involved in litigation in any manner whatsoever on account of this Agreement or the Financial Assets, the Debtor hereby binds and obligates itself, its successors, assigns and legal
representatives to pay the Collateral Parties, in addition to any charge made hereunder for acting as the Intermediary or the Collateral Administrator, as applicable, reasonable attorney s fees incurred by it, and any other disbursements,
expenses, losses, costs and damages in connection with and resulting from such actions.        

(e) 
   Each order, instruction or direction of the Debtor or the Security Agent shall be executed by an individual
designated as an authorized representative of the Debtor or the Security Agent, as the case may be (an   Authorized Representative  ). Each Authorized Representative is authorized to give and receive notices, requests and instructions and
    
      4  

deliver certificates and documents in connection with this Agreement on behalf of the Debtor or the Security Agent, as the case may be, and the specimen signature for each such Authorized
Representative of the Debtor or the Security Agent initially authorized hereunder, is set forth on Exhibit A. From time to time, the Debtor and the Security Agent may deliver to each party hereto a revised exhibit or a specimen signature, but
each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the then current exhibit until receipt of a superseding exhibit.        

(f) 
 Neither Collateral Party shall be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by any of its officers, unless it shall be proven that such Collateral Party was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts.        

(g) 
 The Collateral Parties shall have no duty to determine or inquire into the happening or occurrence of any event or contingency except as expressly required herein. Neither Collateral Party shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct, in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized hereby, or for any action taken or omitted by it in accordance with the written advice of its counsel. In
case any bona fide question arises as to its duties hereunder, each Collateral Party may request instructions from the Security Agent and shall, upon making such request, be entitled at all times to refrain from taking any action unless it has
received written instructions from an Authorized Representative of the Security Agent. If either Collateral Party does not receive such instructions within five Business Days after its request, such Collateral Party may, but shall be under no duty
to, take or refrain from taking a course of action. Each of the Collateral Parties shall act in accordance with instructions received after such five Business Day period except to the extent that it has already taken, or committed itself to take,
action inconsistent with such instructions or acting in accordance with such instructions shall expose such Collateral Party to additional costs, obligations or liabilities, in each case, that are not contemplated in this Agreement or any other
Support Document. Nothing herein shall require either Collateral Party to expend or risk its own funds, or take any action which may, in its judgment, subject it to risk of liability for which it is not adequately indemnified. Neither Collateral
Party shall be responsible for the title, validity, value, marketability or collectability or genuineness of any Financial Asset received by or delivered to it pursuant to this Agreement. The Collateral Parties may exercise or carry out their duties
under this Agreement either directly or indirectly through agents or attorneys, and shall not be responsible for any act or omissions on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care. The Collateral Parties and any such agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of this Section 3 shall apply to any such agent and to the Affiliates of the Collateral Parties and any such
agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as Collateral Parties.        

(h) 
   The Intermediary shall, in accordance with Sections 3.7(a) and 3.7(b) of the Loan Agreement, invest collected
funds standing to the credit of an Account in Eligible Investments (as defined below) on any Business Day on which the Collateral Parties have received written instructions from an Authorized Representative of the Debtor prior to 11:00 a.m. New York
time (such instructions being referred to herein as   Proper        
      5  

Instructions  ). All Eligible Investments shall be held in the name of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties. In accordance with any Proper Instructions, the
Intermediary shall make such Eligible Investments of the type selected in the Proper Instructions, subject to the availability of the Eligible Investments selected, with the cash amount on deposit in the Accounts as of 11:00 a.m. New York time on
such day. If the Intermediary does not receive such Proper Instructions prior to 11:00 a.m. New York time, funds on deposit in the Accounts shall remain uninvested. Funds on deposit in the Accounts shall initially be uninvested.   Eligible
Investments   has the meaning given to such term in the Loan Agreement. An Eligible Investment may be made by the Intermediary with or through the Security Agent or any of its Affiliates.    
   
   The Collateral Parties shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any
liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing delivered to either Collateral Party under or in connection with this Agreement or the Security Agreement and believed by it to
be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Collateral Parties may consult with counsel, financial advisers or accountants which are employed by a law firm, financial services firm or accounting firm, as applicable, that is

liability or action as such expenses are incurred.

4.2

Party or the Security Agent or any officer, agent, stockholder, partner, member, director or employee of any of them for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of
liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and the Debtor hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such
damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.      

(a) 
 The Debtor shall be responsible for, and hereby agrees to pay, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Parties and the Security Agent in connection with the establishment and maintenance of the
Accounts, including the Collateral Parties  customary fees and expenses, any costs or expenses incurred by the Collateral Parties as a result of conflicting claims or notices involving the parties hereto, including the fees and expenses of its

it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.      
   A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in

are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.      
   If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
party or any circumstance, is held to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal (in whole or in part) for any reason (in any jurisdiction), the remaining terms of this Agreement, modified by the deletion of the unenforceable, invalid or illegal portion
(in any relevant jurisdiction), will continue in full force and effect, and such unenforceability, invalidity, or illegality will not otherwise affect the enforceability, validity or legality of the remaining terms of this Agreement so long as this
Agreement as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the deletion of such portion of this Agreement will not substantially impair the respective
expectations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties.

Either party hereto may change its address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other party hereto.  
 The Security Agent and the Intermediary agree to accept and act upon instructions or directions pursuant to this Agreement or any documents
executed in connection herewith sent by unsecured email or other similar unsecured electronic methods;  provided  that any person providing such instructions or directions (if such person is not listed in Exhibit A (Authorized Representatives
of Security Agent) hereto) shall provide to the Security Agent and the Intermediary an incumbency certificate listing persons designated to provide such instructions or directions (including the email addresses of such persons), which incumbency
certificate shall be amended whenever a person is added or deleted from the listing. If such person elects to give the Security Agent and the Intermediary email (of .pdf or similar files) (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the
Security Agent and the Intermediary in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, their reasonable understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Security Agent and the Intermediary shall not, in the absence of any bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Security Agent or the Intermediary, as the case may be, be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from their reliance upon and compliance with such
instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflicting with or being inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. Any person providing such instructions or directions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic
methods to submit instructions and directions to the Security Agent and the Intermediary, including without limitation the risk of the Security Agent and the Intermediary acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse
by third parties.    Any notices or other communications delivered to the Intermediary shall be delivered with a copy to the Collateral
Administrator.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any and all communications (both text and attachments) by or
from the Intermediary that the Intermediary in its sole discretion deems to contain confidential, proprietary, and/or sensitive information and sent by electronic mail will be encrypted. The recipient of the email communication will be required
to complete a one-time registration process.     
   Any party may by notice to each other party change the address or
facsimile number at which notices or other communications are to be given to it.

10.

District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City; and (b) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have
been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party. Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing

30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the Security Agent. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 9. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.      
    EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT THAT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING.  Each party hereby (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the other

   The Pledgor shall:  

(a) 
 give, make, execute, deliver, file and/or record any financing statement, notice, instrument, document, agreement or other papers and take any other actions, including, without limitation, fulfilling its obligations

      Page 7  

(c) 
 the Security Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not the Uniform Commercial Code is in effect in the
jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including the
right, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to exercise all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining to the Collateral as if the Security Agent were the sole and absolute owner thereof (and the Pledgor agrees to take all such
actions as may be appropriate to give effect to such right);        

(d) 
 the Security Agent (acting solely at the direction of the Administrative Agent) may, in its name or in the name of the Pledgor or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time payable
or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral but shall be under no obligation to do so;        

(e) 
 the Security Agent may set-off any amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Secured Obligations against any Collateral in the form of Cash;    

(f) 
 subject to the following provisions of this Section 5.1, the Security Agent may (acting solely at the direction of the Administrative Agent), upon 10 days  prior written notice to the Pledgor of the time and
place, with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof which shall then be or shall thereafter come into the possession, custody or control of the Security Agent or any of its agents, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such
Collateral, in a commercially reasonable manner, at such place or places as the Security Agent deems best in such manner, and for Cash or for credit or for future delivery (without thereby assuming any credit risk), at public or private sale,
without demand of performance or notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of the time or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and the Security Agent or anyone else may be
the purchaser, lessee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the extent permitted by law, at any private sale) and thereafter hold the same absolutely, free from any claim or right of
whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of redemption (statutory or otherwise) of the Pledgor, any such demand, notice, claim and right or equity being hereby expressly waived and released to the extent permitted by law. Subject to the
following provisions of this Section 5.1, the Security Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale,
and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the sale may be so adjourned; and        

(g) 
 all funds or other property received by the Pledgor under or in connection with any Assigned Agreement or otherwise in respect of the Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Security Agent (for and
on behalf of the Secured Parties), shall be segregated from other funds and property of the Pledgor and shall (i) in the case of funds, be applied as provided in Section 5.2 and (ii) in the case of other property, be forthwith
delivered to the Security Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement).    
      Page 8  

The Pledgor agrees that in any sale of any of the Collateral whenever an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Security Agent is hereby authorized to comply with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it may be advised by its counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of applicable law
(including compliance with such procedures as may restrict the number of prospective bidders and purchasers, require that such prospective bidders and purchasers have certain qualifications, and restrict such prospective bidders and purchasers to
persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale of such Collateral), or in order to obtain any required approval of the sale or of the purchaser by
any governmental regulatory authority or official, and the Pledgor further agrees that such compliance shall not result in such sale being considered or deemed not to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner, nor shall the Security Agent
be liable nor accountable to the Pledgor for any discount allowed by the reason of the fact that such Collateral is sold in compliance with any such limitation or restriction.  
 Section 9-610 of the UCC states that the Secured Parties are able to purchase the Collateral only if the Collateral is sold at a public
sale. The Pledgor has been advised that staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission have issued various no action letters describing procedures which, in the view of the such staff, permit a default sale of securities to occur in a manner that
is public for purposes of Article 9 of the UCC, yet not public for purposes of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Pledgor has been advised that the UCC permits the Pledgor to agree on the standards for determining whether a Secured
Party has complied with its obligations under Article 9 of the UCC. Pursuant to the UCC, the Pledgor hereby specifically agrees (x) that it shall not raise any objection to any Secured Party s purchase of the Collateral (through bidding on
the obligations or otherwise) and (y) that a default sale conducted in conformity with the principles set forth in the no action letters promulgated by such staff (1) shall be considered to be a  public  sale for purposes of the
UCC, (2) shall be considered commercially reasonable notwithstanding that such Secured Party has not registered or sought to register the Collateral under the Securities Act, even if the Pledgor agrees to pay all costs of the registration
process, and (3) shall be considered to be commercially reasonable notwithstanding that such Secured Party purchases the Collateral at such a sale.  
 The Security Agent shall incur no liability as a result of the sale of any Debt Obligation, or any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant
to this Section 5.1 conducted as provided in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 5.1. To the extent the sale of a Debt Obligation is conducted as provided in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 5.1, the Pledgor hereby waives
any claims against the Security Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which such Debt Obligation may have been sold at any private sale effected as provided above was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public
sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations.    The proceeds of each collection, sale or other disposition under
this Section 5.1 shall be applied in accordance with Section 5.2.      

5.2 
  Application of Proceeds       The proceeds of any collection, sale or other realization of
all or any part of the Collateral pursuant hereto (including any amounts on deposit in, or otherwise standing to the credit of, the Custodial Account) shall be deposited into the Collection Account and applied by the Security Agent in the manner and
priority set forth in Section 3.7(g) of the Loan Agreement.  
      Page 9  

5.3 
  Power of Attorney and Security Agent May Perform         

(a) 
 The Security Agent is hereby appointed the   attorney-in-fact   of the Pledgor for the purpose, during any period when the Security Agent is
attempting to sell all or any portion of the Debt Obligations pursuant to Section 5.1(f), of taking any action and executing any instruments which the Security Agent may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement (including with respect to the exercise of any remedies hereunder against the Pledgor), which appointment as   attorney-in-fact   is irrevocable and coupled with
an interest.        

(b) 
 If the Pledgor fails to perform any of its obligations contained herein, the Security Agent may take such action (acting solely at the direction of the Administrative Agent) to protect the security interest granted
hereunder in the Collateral or to protect the value thereof, but without any requirement to do so and without notice, itself perform, or cause performance of, such obligation, and the expenses of the Security Agent incurred in connection therewith
shall be payable by the Pledgor.        

6.  
  Custodial Account and Collection Accounts         
   Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, while an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Security Agent shall receive and collect, directly and without intervention or assistance of any fiscal agent or other intermediary, all Money and other property payable to or receivable by the Security
Agent. All amounts so received or collected shall be deposited in the Collection Accounts.

 To the extent that an obligor does not make the applicable payment directly to the Interest Collection Account or the Principal Collection
Account, as the case may be, the Pledgor shall from time to time: (i) deposit into the Interest Collection Account, immediately

and all other funds received by the Pledgor in respect of the Collateral, in each case, that are attributable as Interest Proceeds) and (B) any other amounts that are received by the Pledgor that are not required hereunder to be deposited
into the Principal Collection Account; and (ii) deposit into the Principal Collection Account, immediately upon its receipt thereof, (A) all Principal Proceeds (including all proceeds received from the disposition of any Collateral by the
Pledgor, all Collections with respect to the Collateral and all other funds received by the Pledgor in respect of the Collateral, in each case, that are attributable as Principal Proceeds), (B) any proceeds of any advance made under

Agent, direct the Security Agent to withdraw funds on deposit in the Interest Collection Account and apply such funds to pay interest as required by, and subject to the conditions of, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7 of the Loan Agreement.

held for the benefit of the Security Agent shall be done in the following manner (with any and all other actions necessary to create in favor of the Security Agent a valid, first-priority security interest in each item of Collateral under applicable
law and regulations (including Articles 8 and 9 of the UCC) in effect at the time of such transfer):      

(a) 
 each time that the Pledgor shall direct or cause the acquisition of any Collateral constituting a Security Entitlement, the Pledgor shall, if such Collateral has not already been transferred to the Custodial Account and
credited thereto, cause the transfer of such Collateral to the Security Agent to be held in and credited to the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Account Control Agreement;    

(b) 
 each time that the Pledgor shall direct or cause the acquisition of any Collateral constituting a Certificated Security or Instrument in physical form, the Security Agent shall hold for the benefit of the Secured

 the Pledgor shall, within ten days after the date of execution of this Agreement, file, or cause the filing of, all appropriate financing statements covering the Collateral in the proper filing office in the appropriate
jurisdictions under applicable law.

receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, any remaining Collateral and money received in respect thereof, to or on the order of the Pledgor. The Security Agent shall also execute and deliver to the Pledgor upon such
termination and payment such UCC termination statements and such other documentation as shall be reasonably requested and prepared by the Pledgor (at the Pledgor s expense) to effect the termination and release of the pledge, security interest,
Lien and right of set-off granted pursuant to Section 2.      

7.  
  The Security Agent         

7.1 
   The Person serving as the Security Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Secured Party as any other Secured Party and may exercise the same as though it were not the Security Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Pledgor or
any Subsidiary or     
      Page 13  

other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Security Agent hereunder. 7.2 The Security Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Security Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Security
Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except as directed by the Administrative Agent in writing, and (c) shall not be liable for the failure to disclose any information relating to
the Pledgor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by it or any of its Affiliates in any capacity (except that the foregoing shall not limit any express obligation hereunder). The Security Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Security Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of
Default or Potential Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Security Agent by the Administrative Agent, and the Security Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, opinion, notice, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any
other Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement or elsewhere herein or therein.    

7.3 
   The Security Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, opinion, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Security Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally
or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Security Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Pledgor), independent accountants and other
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable (absent gross negligence or willful misconduct) for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Security Agent may conclusively
rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting on any written notice, request, waiver, consent, resolution, certificate, order, direction or
other document or instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Security Agent is authorized to act or refrain from acting under this Agreement in accordance with
instructions received by it from the Administrative Agent. In performing its duties under this Agreement, the Security Agent may request further instructions from the Administrative Agent as to the course of action desired by the Administrative
Agent. If the Security Agent does not receive such instructions within five Business Days after its request, the Security Agent may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking a course of action. The Security Agent shall act in
accordance with instructions received after such five Business Day period except to the extent that it has already taken, or committed itself to take, action inconsistent with such instructions or acting in accordance with such instructions shall
expose the Security Agent to additional costs, obligations or liabilities, in each case, that are not contemplated in this Agreement or any other Support Document. The Security Agent shall not be bound to make any
    
      Page 14  

investigation into the facts stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, consent, order, approval, bond or other document or have any responsibility for filing
or recording any financing or continuation statement in any public office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or lien granted by any Person under any credit document.    

7.4 
 The Security Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more  sub-agents  appointed by the Security Agent with reasonable
due care. The Security Agent and any such  sub-agent  may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such  sub-agent  and to the Affiliates of the Security Agent and any such  sub-agent.     

7.5 
 Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Security Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Security Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Secured Parties and the Pledgor. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, after prior written consent from the Pledgor (not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Security Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Security Agent may, after prior written consent from the Pledgor (not to be unreasonably withheld), appoint a successor
Security Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York City or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Security Agent, such successor Security Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Security Agent and the resigning Security Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Pledgor to a successor Security Agent shall be the same as
those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Pledgor and such successor. The provisions of this Section 7 shall continue in effect and survive the termination of this Agreement.    

7.6 
 Neither the Security Agent nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, agents or employees shall be liable to the Pledgor, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, willful
misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties hereunder. The Security Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by any of its officers. The Security Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized hereby. The Security Agent shall not have any liability for any loss arising from any cause beyond its control, including but not limited to, the act, failure or
neglect of any agent selected with reasonable due care by the Security Agent, except with respect to Affiliates of the Security Agent, or the acts or edicts of any government or governmental agency or other group or entity exercising governmental
powers.        

7.7 
 The Security Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any loss occasioned by delay in the actual receipt of any certificates, opinions, notices, instruments, notices, schedules, agreements or documents nor for any
failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, earthquakes, fires, floods,
wars, civil or military disturbances, sabotage, epidemics, riots, interruptions, loss or malfunctions of external utilities or external communications service, acts or civil or military authority or other governmental actions.    
      Page 15  

7.8 
 It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Security Agent shall not be required to use, advance or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or the
exercise of any of its rights and powers as Security Agent hereunder (except for the expenses of the Security Agent in performing its duties hereunder). Anything in this Agreement notwithstanding, in no event shall the Security Agent be liable for
special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if it has been advised of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.    

7.9 
 The Security Agent shall not have any responsibility or liability to evaluate the financial condition of any Person or to review any of the certificates, opinions, instruments, notices, schedules, agreements and
documents delivered to it or to enforce any Person s obligation to deliver them.        

7.10 
 The Security Agent shall not be responsible to any Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties regarding the Pledgor or the Collateral or in any document, certificate or other writing
delivered in connection herewith or therewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of thereof or any such other document or the financial condition of any
Person or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions related to any Person or the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default. The Security Agent shall not have any obligation whatsoever to any Person to assure that any Collateral exists or is owned by any Person or is cared for, protected or insured or that any liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully
created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers
granted or available with respect thereto.        

8.  
  Miscellaneous

The Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian agree to accept and act upon instructions or
directions pursuant to this Agreement or any documents executed in connection herewith sent by unsecured email or other similar unsecured electronic methods;  provided , that any person providing such instructions or directions (if such person
is not listed in Exhibit A (Authorized Representatives of Security Agent) to the Account Control Agreement) shall provide to the Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian an incumbency certificate listing persons designated to provide such
instructions or directions (including the email addresses of such persons), which incumbency certificate shall be amended whenever a person is added or deleted from the listing. If such person elects to give the Security Agent and the Security Agent
Custodian email (of .pdf or similar files) (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, their reasonable understanding of such
instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian shall not, in the absence of any bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Security Agent or the Security Agent Custodian, as
the case may be, be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from their reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflicting with or being inconsistent with a subsequent
written instruction. Any person providing such instructions or directions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian,
including without limitation the risk of the Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties.  
   
   No failure on the part of the Security Agent to exercise, and no course of
dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Security Agent of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.      
   No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will
be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the Pledgor, and the Security Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders);  provided  that, without the prior written
consent of each Lender, the Security Agent shall not (except as provided herein) release any Collateral or otherwise terminate any Lien hereunder, agree to additional obligations being secured by any Collateral security, alter the relative
priorities of the Secured Obligations entitled to the benefits of the Lien created hereunder, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Security Agent is hereby authorized, to release any Lien covering property that is the subject of a
disposition of property permitted under the Loan Agreement (as evidenced by an officer s certificate of the Pledgor).    The terms of
this Agreement may be waived, altered or amended only by an instrument in writing duly executed by the Pledgor, the Security Agent and the Security Agent Custodian.

8.4 
  Successors and Assigns       This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the respective successors and permitted assigns of the Pledgor and the Security Agent. Neither party shall assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such purported
assignment without such consent shall be void.      
   This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of
it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by email transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.      
   This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and this Agreement
and all matters arising out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York.  
   
   With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this Agreement
or any matter between the parties arising under or in connection with this Agreement (  Proceedings  ), each party irrevocably: (a) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States
District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City; and (b) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have
been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party. Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction, nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.      
    THE PLEDGOR AND THE SECURITY AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.  
      Page 18  

The Security Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact
in connection herewith and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith.      
   If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to either party or any circumstance, is held to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal (in whole or in part) for any reason (in any relevant jurisdiction), the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this
Agreement, modified by the deletion of the unenforceable, invalid or illegal portion (in any relevant jurisdiction), will continue in full force and effect, and such unenforceability, invalidity, or illegality will not otherwise affect the
enforceability, validity or legality of the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Agreement so long as this Agreement as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to
the subject matter hereof and the deletion of such portion of this Agreement will not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be
conferred upon the parties. The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited or unenforceable provision with a valid provision, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited or
unenforceable provision.      
   Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall give
to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement, except Section 5.2 hereof, which shall benefit the Secured Parties.
