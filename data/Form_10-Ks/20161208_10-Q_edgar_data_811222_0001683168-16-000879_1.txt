1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with both generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information, and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that are, in the
opinion of management, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results
are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the interim financial information have
read or have access to the Company s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly,
these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and the related notes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 thereto contained in the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Organization and Nature of Operations  

Legacy Card Company ( Legacy )
was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability
Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff International, Inc. ( Cardiff , the
 Company ), a publicly held corporation. In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff into a
holding company that adopted a new business model known as  Collaborative Governance,  a form of governance enabling
businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies
with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay
a dividend to the Company s shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect the Company s shareholders by
acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management
that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting
rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses. By December of 2013, the Company had negated more than 90% of all its debt; by
July of 2014, the Company had completed the acquisition of three businesses: We Three, LLC; Romeo s NY Pizza; and Edge View
Properties, Inc. The Company delayed the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10-K ) for the year ended
December 31, 2015 due to difficulty obtaining information from another acquisition, which was subsequently unwound. 

Description of Business  

Cardiff is a holding company that adopted a
new business model known as  Collaborative Governance.  To date, the Company is not aware of any other domestic holding
company using the same business philosophy or governing policies. The Company s business footprint is to acquire strong companies
that meet the following criteria: (1) in business for a minimum of two years; (2) profitable; (3) good management team; (4) little
to no debt; and (5) assets of a minimum of $1,000,000. Cardiff continues to practice all business ethics under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 ( 1934 Act ) and acknowledges that there are more than 43 successful Business Development Companies subject
to the Investment Company Act of 1940 ( 1940 Act ), all of which may be considered competition to Cardiff and that
are established and available to the public for investment. These companies offer experienced management, dividends and financial
security. 

To date, Cardiff consists of the following whole-owned subsidiaries: 

We Three, LLC (Affordable Housing Initiative) acquired
on May 15, 2014; 

 Romeo s NY Pizza acquired on June 30, 2014; 

 Edge View Properties, Inc acquired on July 16, 2014; 

 FDR Enterprises, Inc. acquired on August 10, 2016; 

 Repicci s Franchise Group, LLC acquired on August
10, 2016; 

 Refreshment Concepts, LLC acquired on August 10, 2016. 

Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company is in the development stage and, as such, has sustained
operating losses since its inception and has negative working capital and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial
doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had shareholders 
deficit of $1,001,385. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern. As a result, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its
report on the Company s December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern and the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusions.
Management has prospective investors and believes the raising of capital will allow the Company to pursue new acquisitions. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or from operations
in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to it. Should the Company be unable to raise sufficient funds, it may be required
to curtail its operating plans. In addition, increases in expenses may require cost reductions. No assurance can be given that
the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future. Should the Company not be able
to raise sufficient funds, it may cause cessation of operations. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements up to ASU 2016-13, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements
may be expected to cause a material impact on its consolidated financial condition or the consolidated results of its operations. 

2. PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET 

Plant and equipment, net as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 was $471,438 and $540,024, respectively, consisting of the following:

2015, depreciation expense was $35,772 and $33,622, respectively. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2016,

Company purchases a Vehicle for $3,974.

As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had land of $603,000 located in Salmon, Idaho with area of approximately 30 acres, which was in connection with the
acquisition of Edge View Properties, Inc. in July 2014. The Company issued 241,199 shares of Series E Preferred Stock as consideration
for this acquisition. Based on the price of $2.50 per share, the acquisition consideration represents a $603,000 valuation. The
land is currently vacant and is expected to be developed into residential community. The value of the land is not subject to be
depreciated. 

4. ACCRUED EXPENSES 

As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,

6. NOTES PAYABLE

Notes Payable   Unrelated Party  

On March 12, 2009, the Company entered into
a preferred debenture agreement with a shareholder for $20,000. The note bore interest at 12% per year and matured on September

On September 7, 2011, the Company entered into

1, net of debt discount, was $50,000 and $50,000 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

On November 17, 2011, the Company entered into

is due on demand. The balance of Note 3, was $9,000 and $0 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The following is a schedule showing the future
minimum loan payments in the future 5 years. 

7. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

Some of the Convertible Notes issued as described
below included an anti-dilution provision that allowed for the adjustment of the conversion price. The Company considered the guidance
provided by the FASB in   Determining Whether an Instrument Indexed to an Entity s Own Stock ,  the result
of which indicates that the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company determined that,
as the conversion price of the Notes issued in connection therewith could fluctuate based future events, such prices were not fixed
amounts. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion features of the Notes issued in connection therewith are not considered
indexed to the Company s stock and characterized the value of the conversion feature of such notes as derivative liabilities
upon issuance. 

Convertible notes at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized
as follows: 

Convertible Notes Payable   Unrelated Party 

On April 17, 2014, the Company entered into
an unsecured Convertible Note ( Note 4 ) in the amount of $9,000. Note 4 was convertible into Common Shares of the
Company at $0.005 per share at the option of the holder. Note 4 bore interest at eight percent per year, matured on June 17, 2014,
and was unsecured. All principal and unpaid accrued interest was due at maturity. The Company is currently in default on Note 4.
On August 17, 2015, a portion of principal of $1,500 was converted into 300,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company upon the
request of the holder. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the note holder converted $1,216 principal and $1,084 accrued interest
payable into 460,000 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.005 per share. And $3,000 of principal is forgiven by the
note holder. The balance of the note was $3,284 and $9,000 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

On May 6, 2015, the Company entered into a
10% convertible promissory note ( Note 5 ) with an unrelated entity in the amount of $12,200. Note 5 bore interest
at ten percent per year, matured on September 3, 2015, and was unsecured. Note 5 was convertible into Common Shares of the Company
at the conversion ratio of 50% discount to market at the lowest traded price within 20 business days prior to  Notice of
Conversion . This gives rise to derivative liability accounting related to this Note since the conversion ratio is considered
floorless. 

Accordingly, Note 5 has been evaluated with
respect to the terms and conditions of the conversion features contained in Note 5 to determine whether they represent embedded
or freestanding derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 815. The Company determined that the conversion features contained
in Note 5 for $12,200 carrying value represents a freestanding derivative instrument that meets the requirements for liability
classification under ASC 815. As a result, the fair value of the derivative financial instrument in the note is reflected in the
Company s balance sheet as a liability. The fair value of the derivative financial instrument of the convertible note was
measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model at the inception date of Note 5 and will do so again on each subsequent balance
sheet date. Any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income
or expense at each balance sheet date. 

The table below sets forth the assumptions
for Black-Scholes valuation model on May 6, 2015 (inception) and December 31, 2015, March 8, 2016, respectively. For the period
ended June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and the Company had initial loss of $10,295 due to derivative liabilities, and decreased
the derivative liability of $22,495 by $8,547, resulting in a derivative liability of $12,217 and $13,948 at March 8, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. On March 8, 2016, the converted note agreement was amended and therefore the conversion price becomes $0.005.
And the derivative liabilities of $12,217 was reclassified as additional capital as a result of the addendum. 

The Company is currently in default on Note
5. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the note holders converted $10,200 unpaid principal and $840 accrued interest payable
into 2,208,000 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.005 per share. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
carrying values of Note 5 were $2,000 and $12,200 and the debt discount was $0 and $0, respectively. The Company recorded interest
expense related to Note 5 in amount of $355 and $0 during the period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accrued interest
of Note 5 was $314 and $799 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

On July 29, 2015, the Company entered into
an 8% convertible promissory note ( Note 6 ) with an unrelated entity in the amount of $10,000. Note 6 bore interest
at eight percent per year, matured on November 26, 2015, and was unsecured. Note 6 was convertible into Common Shares of the Company
at the conversion ratio of 50% discount to market at the conversion date. However, if the closing bid price of the Company s
Common Shares falls below $0.10 per share, the conversion price will be changed to $0.01 per share and remain intact from that
point forward. Since the Company s common stock was $0.075 per share at December 31, 2015, the conversion feature contained
in Note 6 no longer meets the requirements for liability classification under ASC 815. As a result, the embedded derivative liability
of $10,008 at December 31, 2015 was reclassified as additional paid-in capital. 

The table below sets forth the assumptions
for Black-Scholes valuation model on July 29, 2015 (inception) and December 31, 2015, respectively. For the period ended December
31, 2015, the Company had initial loss of $8,041 due to derivative liabilities, and decreased the derivative liability of $18,041
by $8,033, resulting in a derivative liability of $10,008 at December 31, 2015. The derivative liabilities is reclassified as
additional paid in capital due to the conversion price become fixed price as of January 1, 2016. 

The Company is currently in default on Note
6 and bears default interest at ten percent per year. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying values of Note 6 were $10,000 and the
debt discount was $0. The Company recorded interest expense related to Note 6 in amount of $500 and $0 during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2016, respectively. The accrued interest of Note 6 was $809 and $359 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. 

On February 3, 2016, the Company entered into
a 15% convertible line of credit ( Note 7 ) with an unrelated entity in the amount up to $50,000. On February 9, 2016,
the Company received $17,500 cash for the line of credit, matured on February 9, 2017, and was unsecured. This note was convertible
into Common Shares of the Company at the conversion ratio of $0.03 or 50% discount of the lowest closing price on the primary trading
market on which Company's Common stock is quoted for the last five trading days prior to the conversion date. However, the note
is not converted after 6 months of the effective date of this note. And therefore, no derivative liability is generated as of June
30, 2016. 

On March 8, 2016, the Company entered into
a 15% convertible line of credit ( Note 8 ) with an unrelated entity in the amount of $50,000, matured on March 8,
2018, and was unsecured. This note was convertible into Common Shares of the Company at the conversion ratio of $0.03 or 50% discount
of the lowest closing price on the primary trading market on which Company's Common stock is quoted for the last five trading days
prior to the conversion date. However, the note is not converted after 6 months of the effective date of this note. And therefore,
no derivative liabilities is generated as of June 30, 2016.

On April 21, 2008, the Company entered into
an unsecured Convertible Debenture ( Debenture 1 ) with a shareholder in the amount of $150,000. Debenture 1 was convertible
into Common Shares of the Company at $0.03 per share at the option of the holder no earlier than August 21, 2008. Debenture 1 bore

debt discount during 2008 which has been fully amortized. The Company is in default on Debenture 1, and the warrants have not been
exercised. The balance of Debenture 1 was $150,000 and $150,000 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

8. PAYROLL TAXES 

The Company previously reported that it has
failed to remit payroll tax payments since 2006, as required by various taxing authorities. Payroll taxes and estimated penalties
were accrued in recognition of accrued salaries subsequently settled via stock issue and other agreements that did not result in
reportable or taxable payroll transactions. These accruals were reversed for prior years, and a similar estimated accrual established
for the 2015. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties that
the Company could incur as a result of payroll related taxes and penalties to be $38,641 and $38,902, respectively. 

9. NET LOSS PER SHARE

resources, legal and credit and collections, are partially allocated to the two operating segments. Other revenue consists of nonrecurring
items.

payments and high property taxes. If bad credit is an issue preventing people from purchasing a traditional house, the Company
will provide a financial leasing option with  0  interest on the lease providing a  lease to own  option for
their family home. 

The Company-owned Pizza Restaurant segment
includes sales and operating results for all Company-owned restaurants. Assets for this segment include equipment, furniture and
fixtures for the Company-owned restaurants.

our prospects for achieving our intended business objectives. We have limited resources and have had limited revenues since our
formation.

income from the invested funds and unless the investor can afford a total loss of his or her investment. 

Additional Financing Requirements.

Critical Accounting Estimates  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that may not be readily apparent from other sources. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 

We consider our critical accounting estimates
to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management
to determine, and (3) may produce materially different results when using different assumptions. We have discussed these critical
accounting estimates, the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein
with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our accounting policies specific to share-based compensation expense
and estimation of the fair value of derivative liability involve our most significant judgments and estimates that are material
to our consolidated financial statements. They are discussed further below. 

Derivative Liability  

The Company evaluates its financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For
derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at
its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of
operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the probability weighted average
Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates through the
June 30, 2015 reporting date. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities
are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative
instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Share-based compensation expense  

We account for the issuance of stock, stock
options and warrants for services from employees and non-employees based on an estimate of the fair value of options and warrants
issued using the Black-Scholes pricing model. This model s calculations include the exercise price, the market price of shares
on grant date, weighted average assumptions for risk-free interest rates, expected life of the option or warrant, expected volatility
of our stock and expected dividend yield. 

The amounts recorded in the financial statements
for share-based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions. For example, the assumptions we have
made for the expected volatility of our stock price have been based on the historical volatility of our stock, measured over a
period generally commensurate with the expected term. If we were to use a different volatility than the actual volatility of our
stock price, there may be a significant variance in the amounts of share-based compensation expense from the amounts reported. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In July 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
 Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  more closely align the measurement of inventory in
GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The amendments in this ASU do not
apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all
other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure
inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public business entities,
this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine
if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No.
2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  defers the effective
date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain
employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All
other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and
interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the
guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as
of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting
periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No.
2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

Results of Operations   

We had revenues in the amount of
$209,283 and $482,579 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to revenues of $329,536 and $758,504
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 is attributable
to Romeo s NY Pizza - $168,923, We Three, LLC   $40,360. The revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is attributable
to Romeo s NY Pizza - $383,516, We Three, LLC   $80,973 and Other - $18,090. The revenue for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 is attributable to Romeo s NY Pizza - $286,793, We Three, LLC   $42,743. The revenue for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 is attributable to Romeo s NY Pizza - $663,913, We Three, LLC   $84,491 and Other - $10,100. Our
revenues from rental income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were about the same as the comparable periods in
2015. The decrease in revenues from sales of pizza during this reporting period were attributable to the decrease in number of
stores. We have one pizza store open in 2016. 

We had costs of sales in the
amount of $147,254 and  $284,127 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Comparatively, we had costs
of sales in the amount of $243,194 and $544,592 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The costs for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 are attributable to Romeo s NY Pizza   $96,254 and We Three, LLC  
$51,000. The costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are attributable to Romeo s NY Pizza   $203,157 and We
Three, LLC   $80,970. The costs for the three months ended June 30, 2015 are attributable to Romeo s NY Pizza
  $200,888 and We Three, LLC   $42,306. The costs for the six months ended June 30, 2015 are attributable to
Romeo s NY Pizza   $473,293 and We Three, LLC   $71,299. Our cost related to the rental business during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were about the same as the comparable periods in 2015. The decrease in cost of pizza
sales during this reporting period were attributable to the decrease in number of stores. We have one pizza store open in
2016. 

We had operating expenses of $292,794
and $623,627 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to operating expenses of $3,143,204 and $3,398,209
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The significant decrease in operating expenses in 2016 was primarily
due to no stock issuance for services in this reporting period. Comparatively, there was issuance of 1,650,000 shares of common
stock in 2015 to 4 consultants for marketing, management and financial strategies, resulting in non-cash stock based compensation
of $2,796,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. 

We had a net loss of $242,351 and
$446,213 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to a net loss of $2,879,657 and $3,004,148 for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, representing a decrease by $2,637,306 and $2,557,935, respectively,
in 2016. 

Inflation   

We do not believe that inflation will negatively impact
our business plans. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Since inception, the principal sources
of cash have been funds raised from the sale of common stock, advances from shareholders, and loans in the form of debentures and
convertible notes. At June 30, 2016, we had $62,366 in cash and cash equivalents and total assets amounted to $1,171,612. At December
31, 2015 we had $31,559 of cash and cash equivalents, and total assets amounted to $1,212,479, which include other assets. 

Net cash used in operating activities
was $63,274 and $48,128 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The negative cash flow from operating activities
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was attributable to the net loss of $446,213, partially offset by non-cash expenses of
$50,000 in lieu of convertible promissory note, and the increase in accrued expenses by $196,699 in the current period. The negative
cash flow from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015 was attributable to the net loss offset by non-cash
stock compensation of $2,796,000 and the increase in accrued expenses by $220,421 in 2015. 

Net cash provided by investing activities
was $27,663 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to net cash of $26,287 used in investing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. We had cash of $31,637 from disposal of fixed assets in 2016, which was $30,902 during the same period in
2015. We purchased fixed assets of $3,974 in this reporting period, which was $57,189 during the same period in 2015 for mobile
home lease business. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $66,418 and $90,163 for six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash flows from financing activities during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 were attributable to proceeds of $24,000 from sales of stock and proceeds of $20,684 from convertible
notes payable, which was $132,500 and $12,200, respectively, in 2015. Additionally, we had cash of $31,197 due to related party
in this reporting period, which was $11,759 in 2015. 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to us.
Should we be unable to raise sufficient funds, we may be required to curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights
to portions of our technology or products. In addition, increases in expenses or delays in product development may adversely impact
our cash position and may require cost reductions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent
basis, or at all, in the future. 

In order to continue our operations, development of our
products, and implementation of our business plan, we need additional financing. We are currently attempting to obtain additional
working capital in a term loan transaction. 

Plan of Operation  

Our current business plan is described in  Item
1 - Description of Business  of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of June 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements.

Risk

(a)  
      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed,+ summarized, and reported within the required time periods, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. There have been no changes
to our disclosure controls and procedures during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. 

There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Since the most recent evaluation date, there have
been no significant changes in our internal control structure, policies, and procedures or in other areas that could
significantly affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

(b)  
      Changes in Internal Controls   

There were no significant changes in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent
to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

proceedings and any judgments or injunctions material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director or executive
