INSYNERGY PRODUCTS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
   
 Insynergy Products, Inc. (formerly Insynergy, Inc.) (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010 to engage in Direct Response marketing of consumer products with the goal of producing sales through television and/or retail.  
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Basis of presentation   
 The Company s unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
   
   Use of estimates   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
   Reclassifications   
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
   Recently issued accounting pronouncements   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.  These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  
   
  NOTE 3   INVENTORY  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has no inventory. As of December 31, 2015, there was $131,759 of finished goods and $372,187 of work in process inventory. Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Management has recognized that all the existing inventory no longer has any commercial value and has therefore written all remaining inventory down to zero resulting in a loss on inventory impairment of $373,512, which has been recorded to cost of goods sold. 
   
  NOTE 4   PRODUCT RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES  
 The Company recorded an allowance for estimated customer returns of $223,313 and $609,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance was based on multiple criteria, including type of store, history of returns, length of time since product was sold to the customer and inventory remaining with customer (if known). Use of these criteria resulted in different percentages being applied to different customers. The allowance will be evaluated and adjusted accordingly on a quarterly basis

NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received short term loans from three creditors for a total of $354,000. The loans are uncollateralized, non-interest bearing and are due on demand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company added $1,400 to the balance due and repaid $35,000 for a balance due as of September 30, 2016 of $320,400. 
   
 The Company also has financing loans for its product liability and Director and Officer Insurance. The product liability was cancelled in April 2016. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 the loans have a balance of $12,017 and $16,671, respectively, they bear interest at 5.99% and 6.7% and are due within one year. 
   
  NOTE 6   COMMITMENTS   CONTIGENCIES  
   
 The Company currently occupies office space in Burbank, California. The Company signed a three-year lease starting January 1, 2016. Current lease payments are $3,425 with yearly increases.  The lease required a deposit of $3,500 which was paid on December 10, 2015. Minimum lease payments over the next three years are as follows:  

Investment Agreement  
   
 On July 9, 2014, the Board of Directors approved an investment arrangement with an individual. Per the terms of the agreement the investor has transferred $150,000 to the Company for which he is now entitled to the following. $1 per unit sold through all retail outlets including online and retail shopping shows until the investment is paid back in full. Once the original investment is recouped the investor shall then receive a 2% royalty in perpetuity on all future retail sales of the fitness product. The investment remains with the Company and is disclosed as an accrued liability on the balance sheet. This agreement is currently being renegotiated. 
   
  NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
 As of December 31, 2015, the Company owed its officers $3,253 for cash advances and expense reimbursement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the officers advanced the Company an additional $49,405 and were repaid $25,215, for a balance due of $27,443. The advances were used to pay for general operating expenses. They are uncollateralized, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  
   
  NOTE 8   STOCK OPTIONS  
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $16,324 and $32,648 has been amortized to expense, respectively, for the vesting of options.

A summary of the status of the Company s outstanding stock warrants and changes during the periods is presented below: 

NOTE 9   GOING CONCERN  
   
 As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $15,438,127 at September 30, 2016, had a net loss of $782,170 and net cash used in operating activities of $20,449 for nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 The Company recognizes its cash position does not support the Company s daily operations.  Management is analyzing future potential opportunities for the business including the potential of a restructuring. The Company has been unable to raise additional funds and may need to scale back operations. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
   NOTE 10  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that no material subsequent events exist.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
   
          our future operating results; 
          our business prospects; 
          our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
          the dependence of our future success on the general economy; 
          our possible future financings; and 
          the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital. 
   
 These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we  believe,   anticipate,   expect,   estimate  or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements.

  Plan of Operations  
   
 Insynergy Products ( Insynergy ) was a company with experience in commercializing consumer products through commercial and infomercial production development. The corporate goal was to develop intellectual property ( IP ) internally or via a license from a third party; however, due to the inability to raise funds the Company has abandoned this strategy. The Board of Directors is cognizant of the Company s limitations. The Company currently has no revenue from current operations, with liabilities exceeding its assets. Management is analyzing new potential growth paths and the potential for a restructuring; however, there is still substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a license with Mr. Ross Sklar of The Starco Group.  Insynergy secured the exclusive license to a broad body of novel products and technologies.  
   
   Results of Operation for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded revenue of $28,239 compared to negative revenue of ($115,335) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In the current period we recognized $82,350 of revenue from the accrued product returns and allowance account. This revenue is not from sales in the current period. It is from sales made in 2015 and held in reserve in the event of subsequent returns (Note 4). This was offset by $34,300 reversal of a sale recognized in the prior quarter. In the prior period the negative revenue was due to a mark down program for the Plumber s Hero at two major retailers.  Cost of goods sold was $0 compared to $5,887 of cost of goods sold in the prior period. 
   
   Operating Expenses

 The Company also has a financing loan for its Director and Officer Insurance. As of September 30, 2016, the balance on this loan is $12,027. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Note 1 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

12 

We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.  We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies.  An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. 
   
 We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized. 
   
 The Company follows paragraph 605-15-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition when the right of return exists.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) The seller's price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale, (ii) The buyer has paid the seller, or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product. If the buyer does not pay at time of sale and the buyer's obligation to pay is contractually or implicitly excused until the buyer resells the product, then this condition is not met., (iii) The buyer's obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product, (iv) The buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller. This condition relates primarily to buyers that exist on paper, that is, buyers that have little or no physical facilities or employees. It prevents entities from recognizing sales revenue on transactions with parties that the sellers have established primarily for the purpose of recognizing such sales revenue, (v) The seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and (vi) The amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. 
   
 The Company records an allowance for sales returns. The allowance is based on multiple criteria, including type of store, history of returns, length of time since product was sold to the customer and inventory remaining with customer (if known). The allowance will be evaluated and adjusted accordingly on a quarterly basis 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,  Leases (FAS 13) . ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting, to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this newly issued guidance to its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016.  The following aspects of the Company were noted as potential material weaknesses: 
   
 - 
 timely and accurate reconciliation of accounts 
 - 
 lack of timely document preparation  
 - 
 lack of segregation of duties 
 - 
 complex accounting transaction expertise 
 - 
 lack of corporate documentation  
 In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

14 

Changes in Internal Controls  
   
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 There are not presently any material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of our property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
   
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item. 
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
