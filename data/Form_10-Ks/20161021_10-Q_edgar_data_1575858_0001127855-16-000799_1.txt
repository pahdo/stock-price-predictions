Note 1 Nature of Business 

Business Overview

PureBase Corporation (f/k/a Port of Call Online, Inc.) (the "Company"), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 2, 2010 to create a web-based service that would offer boaters an easy, convenient, fun, easy to use, online resource to help them plan and organize their boating trips. Pursuant to a corporate reorganization consummated on December 23, 2014 the Company changed its business focus to an exploration, mining and product marketing company which will focus on identifying and developing advanced stage natural resource projects which show potential to achieve full production. The business strategy of the Company is to identify, acquire, define, develop and operate world-class industrial and natural resource properties and to contract for mine development and operations services to its mining properties located initially in the Western United States and currently in California and Nevada. The Company intends to engage in the identification, acquisition, development, mining and full-scale exploitation of industrial and natural mineral properties in the United States. The Company plans to package and market such industrial and natural minerals to retail and wholesale industrial and agricultural market sectors. The Company will initially seek to develop deposits of pozzolan, white silica and potassium sulfate on its own properties or acquire such minerals from other sources. These minerals have a wide range of uses including construction, agriculture additives, animal feedstock, ceramics, synthetics, absorbents and electronics.

The Company is headquartered in Ione, California. The Company's business is divided into wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries which will operate as business divisions whose sole focus is to develop sector related products and to provide for distribution of those products into primarily the agricultural and construction industry sectors.

Reverse Merger and Business Combinations

On December 23, 2014 Port of Call Online, Inc. (now Purebase Corporation), an entity without any business or operating activities, entered into an agreement under which it would issue 91,635,604(post- split) shares of unregistered shares of common stock in exchange for 100% equity interest in Purebase, Inc., making Purebase, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Purebase Corporation. This voluntary share exchange transaction resulted in the shareholders of Purebase, Inc. obtaining a majority voting interest in Purebase Corporation.

As of the closing of the Reorganization a majority of Purebase, Inc.'s officers and directors served as directors of the new combined entity. Additionally, Purebase, Inc.'s stockholders were issued approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of the Company after the completion of the transaction.

The share exchange transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger with a public shell (a capital transaction), with Purebase, Inc. as the accounting acquirer and the Purebase Corporation as the legal acquirer.  Although from a legal perspective, Purebase Corporation acquired Purebase, Inc., from an accounting perspective, the transaction is viewed as a recapitalization of Purebase, Inc., accompanied by an issuance of stock by Purebase, Inc. for the net assets of Purebase Corporation. This is because the

Purebase Corporation did not have operations immediately prior to the merger, and following the merger, Purebase, Inc. is the  operating company.  Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements present the historical information of Purebase, Inc. 

On November 24, 2014, Purebase, Inc. acquired 100% ownership of US Agricultural Minerals, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("USAM") that was under common majority ownership. Purebase, Inc. issued 230,000 (post-split) shares of common stock for 100% of the membership interests of USAM. USAM has developed certain intellectual property applicable to making cement and other products of interest to Purebase, Inc. Specifically, USAM has done extensive research and testing of the Potassium Sulfate deposit, Lignite deposit and the Pozzolan deposits for agricultural applications and use as a high grade Supplemental Cementitious Material.  Given that Purebase, Inc. and USAM shared the same majority ownership during 2013 and through the acquisition by Purebase, Inc. on November 24, 2014, the results of operations of USAM are combined with Purebase, Inc. as if the acquisition had occurred in April 2013, when the business commenced operations in accordance with FASB ASC 805-50-45.

New Business

On May 6, 2016, Purebase Corporation and Steve Ridder and John Wharton formed Purebase Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation.   Under the Shareholders' Agreement Purebase obtained a 90% dilutable interest in the Company, Messrs. Wharton and Ridder obtained a 10% non-dilutable interest, Purebase's interest cannot be diluted below 51%.  As of August 31, 2016, the Company owns 71.75% of Purebase Networks, Inc.  Purebase Networks, Inc., develops an Agricultural Technology solution comprised of sensors, proprietary wireless technology, and cloud analytics that assist farmers monitor and manage the health of their soils.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Purebase Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries Purebase Agricultural, Inc. (f.k.a. Purebase, Inc.) and US Agricultural Minerals, LLC ("USAM") and its majority-owned subsidiary Purebase Networks, Inc., collectively referred to as the "Company".  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments), which in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position at August 31, 2016 and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the three months and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  Operating results for the three months and nine months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended November 30, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended November 30, 2015 filed on Form10-K on March 14, 2016.

Going Concern

The Company has incurred net losses generated negative cash flows from operations since inception. In addition, the Company has generated only an insignificant amount of revenue in conjunction with its business plan. In order to support its operations, the Company will require additional infusions of cash from the sale of equity instruments or the issuance of debt instruments, or the commencement of profitable revenue generating activities.  If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company's ability to fund its operations, take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance its properties in the future or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Such limitations could require the Company to curtail, suspend or discontinue parts of its business plan.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 915): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which states that in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This standard modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in "Leases (Topic 840)" and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This ASU is designed to simplify several

aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. ASU 2016-09 will become effective for the Company in the quarter ending February 2018.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2016, the FASB issued AS 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which amends certain aspects of the Board's new revenue standard, ASU 201-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The standard should be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09 which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

Stock Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants, and directors based on estimated fair value.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's statement of operations.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes model. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and value of its common stock and the expected term of the stock options, all of which are highly complex and subjective variables. The variables take into consideration, among other things, actual and projected stock option exercise behavior. The Company calculates an average of historical volatility of similar companies as a basis for its expected volatility. Expected term is computed using the simplified method provided within Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected term of the options.

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share 

Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares, which primarily consist of stock options issued to employees, consultants and directors as well as warrants issued to third parties, have been excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect is anti-dilutive.

For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, warrants and options to purchase 7,977,494 and 477,494 shares of common stock, respectively, have been excluded from the computation of potentially dilutive securities. For the nine-months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, warrants and options to purchase 7,977,494 and 477,494 shares of common stock, respectively, have been excluded from the computation of potentially dilutive securities.

Note 3 Properties 

Placer Mining Claims Lassen County, CA

Placer Mining Claim Notices have been filed and recorded with the US Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") relating to 50 Placer mining claims identified as "USMC 1" thru "USMC 50" covering 1,145 acres of mining property located in Lassen County, California and known as the "Long Valley Pozzolan Deposit". The Long Valley Pozzolan Deposit is a placer claims resource in which the Company holds non-patented mining rights to 1,145acres of contiguous placer claims within the boundaries of a known and qualified Pozzolan deposit. These claims were assigned to Purebase by one of its founders at his original cost basis of $0. These claims require a payment of $30,000 per year to the BLM.

Federal Preference Rights Lease in Esmeralda County, NV

This Preference Rights Lease is granted by the BLM covering approximately 2,500 acres of land located in the Mount Diablo Meridian area of Nevada. Contained in the leased property is the Chimney 1 Potassium/Sulfur Deposit which consists of 15.5 acres of land fully permitted for mining operation which is situated within the 2,500 acres held by Purebase. These rights are presented at their cost of $200,000.  This lease requires a payment of $3,000 per year to the BLM.

Snow White Mine located San Bernardino County, CA - Deposit

On November 28, 2014 US Mining and Minerals Corporation entered into a Purchase Agreement in which US Mining and Minerals Corp. agreed to sell its fee simple property interest and certain mining claims to US Mine Corp. In contemplation of the Plan and Agreement of Reorganization, on December 1, 2014, US Mine Corp assigned its rights and obligations under the Purchase Agreement to the Company pursuant to an Assignment of Purchase Agreement. As a result of the Assignment, the Company assumed the purchaser position under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement involves the sale of approximately 280 acres of mining property containing 5 placer mining claims known as the Snow White Mine located near Barstow, California in San Bernardino County. The property is covered by a Conditional Use Permit allowing the mining of the property and a Plan of Operation and Reclamation Plan has been approved by San Bernardino County and the US Bureau of Land Management ("BLM").   An initial deposit of $50,000 was paid to escrow, and the agreement requires the payment of an additional $600,000 at the end of the escrow period. There was a delay in the seller receiving clear title to the property and a fully permitted project, both of which were conditions to closing. In light of the foregoing, and the payment of another $25,000, the parties agreed to extend the closing. Due to delays in the Company securing the necessary funding to close the purchase of the Snow White Mine property, John Bremer, a director of Purebase, paid $575,000 to acquire the property on or about October, 15, 2015. Mr. Bremer is holding the property on behalf of the Company and will transfer title to the Company when the Company pays Mr. Bremer $575,000 plus expenses. The mining claims require a minimum royalty payment of $3,500 per year.

The categories, as defined by the standard, are as follows:

Level Input:

Input Definition:

Level I

Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.

Level II

Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level I, that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.

Level III

Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at May 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015 for liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

We measure our conversion feature liability issued from our debt financings on a recurring basis. In accordance with current accounting rules ,  the liability for conversion feature is being marked to market each quarter-end until it is completely settled. The conversion feature is valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model, using both observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the expected term is accompanied by a change in the assumption used for the risk free rate and the expected stock.

The following table summarizes our fair value measurements using significant Level III inputs, and changes therein, for the nine-months ended August 31, 2016:

The Complaint was filed by Madelaine and Edwin Durand alleging various causes of action including breach of contract and misrepresentations by various defendants and certain principals of Purebase Ag and USAM. The substance of the Complaint involves the alleged breach and other wrongful acts including the staking and attempted recordation of claims by Defendants pertaining to a Non-Disclosure, Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement entered into between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants on June 26, 2012 and a Mineral Lease contract dated July 10, 2012 relating to certain mining claims allegedly owned by Plaintiffs and known as the Sierra Lady Mining Claims. The Plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to prevent further staking and disclosure of confidential information relating to the Sierra Lady Mining Claims and monetary damages while the Defendants seek to dismiss the case alleging that the Plaintiffs did not have good title to the mineral rights they were attempting to lease to Defendants. On September 11, 2014 a Motion to Dismiss was filed on behalf of all Defendants. A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on February 6, 2015 but was not fully concluded. The Parties reconvened the Hearing on the Motion to Dismiss on April 17, 2015. As a result of the second Hearing, by Order dated May 7, 2015 the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was denied.

The Court dismissed nine (9) of the twelve (12) claims against the Defendants and dismissed the CEO's wife as a defendant. The Plaintiffs were ordered to further amend their Complaint and add their corporation as a named party. On March 25, 2016, the plaintiffs in the above matter filed the Court ordered Second Amended Complaint.

On April 11,2016 defendants in the above entitled matter filed their Answer to the Second Amended Complaint and filed their Counter Claims against the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Dismiss the Company's Counter Claims and Motion to Strike Third Party Complaint.  Defendants have responded to Plaintiffs' Motions.  On   July 22, 2016, the Court served an Order to Set Hearing for Oral Argument on Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike on the Parties.  Subsequently, the Parties conferred on July 29, 2016 and agreed to have the matter heard by the Court on October 20, 2016.

The case is also in its discovery phase.  On July 15, 2016, Defendants' counsel file a Motion to Quash two (2) Subpoenas Duces Tecum served on the Defendants by the Plaintiffs.  On July 18, 2016, Defendants' counsel filed a Motion for Protective Order against the Plaintiffs.  Both Motions have been submitted to the Court and the Parties are awaiting the decision of Discovery Referee. The Defendants plan to continue to vigorously defend the Complaint and prosecute its counterclaims against the Plaintiffs.

Net Loss 

The Company incurred a net loss of $2,265,016 for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to the Company's a net loss of $1,099,863 for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2015, an increase of almost 106%. The increase in net loss is the result of expenses relating to additional executive personnel, financing activities and increases in general business expenses relating to the Company's increased business activities, coupled with a lack of revenues to offset these expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At August 31, 2016 the Company's cash balance was $238,709 and it had a working capital deficit of ($2,384,069).  The Company has insufficient cash on hand to pursue its current business plan and will be required to raise additional capital to fund its ongoing operations. Until the Company is able to establish a sufficient revenue stream from operations its ability to meet its current financial liabilities and commitments will be primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new or existing investors or loans from existing stockholders and management or outside capital sources. Management believes that the Company's current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve-month period. The Company has had negative cash flow from operating activities as it has just begun to generate revenues from production or product sales.  The Company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy its immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet its estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the private placement of Company equity securities, by way of loans, and through such other financing transactions as the Company may determine.

We expect further exploration and development of our current or future projects to commence generating revenues during the next three months but we do not expect revenues from this work to cover our entire current operating expenses which we expect to increase as we implement our business plan. Consequently, we will continue to be dependent on outside sources of capital to sustain our operations and implement our business plan until operating revenues are sufficient to cover our operating expenses.  If we are unable to raise sufficient capital we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition.  There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate.  Even if we are able to secure outside financing, it may not be available in the amounts or times when we require or on terms we find acceptable.  Furthermore, such financing would likely take the form of bank loans, private placements of debt or equity securities or some combination of these.  The issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of current investors while incurring loans, lines of credit or long-term debt by the Company would increase its cash flow requirements and possible loss of valuable assets if such obligations were not repaid in accordance with their terms.

Going Concern

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining additional financing to sustain our business activities. For these reasons our auditors stated in their report on our fiscal year-end audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt we would be able to continue as a going concern.

During the quarter ended August 31, 2016 the Company had minimal recurring revenue-generating operations. For the Company to continue as a going concern it will continue to be dependent on fund raising for project development, product marketing and payment of general and administration expenses, until revenue-generating operations are achieved. The Company has no commitment from any party to provide additional working capital and there is no assurance that such funding will be available if needed, or if available, that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company.

The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PR   OCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer (the "Certifying Officers"), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of the date of the evaluation, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were currently ineffective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management has identified two material weaknesses and is taking action to remedy and remove the weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting:

- 
 
 Lack of an independent board of directors, including an independent financial expert. The current board of directors is evaluating expanding the board of directors to include additional independent directors. The current board is composed of four members and may be expanded to as many as nine members under the Company's By-Laws.

- 
 
 Lack of adequate accounting resources and adequate segregation of duties over various accounting and reporting functions.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

The Certifying Officers have also indicated that there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the Company's last fiscal quarter, and no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or other factors that could significantly affect such controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation and there were no corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Our management, including the Certifying Officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II  OTHER INF   ORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEE   DINGS

Purebase Ag and US Agricultural Minerals, LLC ("USAM") along with certain principals of those entities were named as defendants in a Complaint filed in the Second Judicial District Court in Washoe County, Nevada (Case # CV14 01348) on June 23, 2014. The Complaint was filed by Madelaine and Edwin Durand alleging various causes of action including breach of contract and misrepresentations by various defendants and certain principals of Purebase Ag and USAM. The substance of the Complaint involves the alleged breach and other wrongful acts including the staking and attempted recordation of claims by Defendants pertaining to a Non-Disclosure, Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement entered into between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants on June 26, 2012 and a Mineral Lease contract dated July 10, 2012 relating to certain mining claims allegedly owned by Plaintiffs and known as the Sierra Lady Mining Claims. The Plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to prevent further staking and disclosure of confidential information relating to the Sierra Lady Mining Claims and monetary damages while the Defendants seek to dismiss the case alleging that the Plaintiffs did not have good title to the mineral rights they were attempting to lease to Defendants. On September 11, 2014 a Motion to Dismiss was filed on behalf of all Defendants. A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on February 6, 2015 but was not fully concluded. The Parties reconvened the Hearing on the Motion to Dismiss on April 17, 2015. As a

result of the second Hearing, by Order dated May 7, 2015 the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was denied. However, the Complaint was deemed deficient and the Plaintiffs were given 60 days in which to file one amended Complaint. On June 16, 2015 the Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint which, among other things, added the Company as a named Defendant. On June 29, 2015 the Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. Oral arguments on the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss were heard on December 17, 2015. On March 25, 2016, the Court issued its decision regarding Defendant's Motion to Dismiss all claims.  The Court dismissed nine (9) of the twelve (12) claims against the Defendants and dismissed the CEO's wife as a defendant. The Plaintiffs were ordered to further amend their Complaint and add their corporation as a named party. On March 25, 2016, the plaintiffs in the above matter filed the Court ordered Second Amended Complaint.

On April 11,2016 defendants in the above entitled matter filed their Answer to the Second Amended Complaint and filed their Counter Claims against the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Dismiss the Company's Counter Claims and Motion to Strike Third Party Complaint.  Defendants have responded to Plaintiffs' Motions.  On   July 22, 2016, the Court served an Order to Set Hearing for Oral Argument on Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike on the Parties.  Subsequently, the Parties conferred on July 29, 2016 and agreed to have the matter heard by the Court on October 20, 2016.

The case is also in its discovery phase.  On July 15, 2016, Defendants' counsel file a Motion to Quash two (2) Subpoenas Duces Tecum served on the Defendants by the Plaintiffs.  On July 18, 2016, Defendants' counsel filed a Motion for Protective Order against the Plaintiffs.  Both Motions have been submitted to the Court and the Parties are awaiting the decision of Discovery Referee. The Defendants plan to continue to vigorously defend the matter and prosecute their cross-claims.

On September 28, 2016, the Discovery Referee assigned to our matter issued its "Recommendation for Order" on our Motion for a Protective Order and Motion to Quash.  The Referee has stayed all discovery to allow the parties to meet and confer about Plaintiff's discovery requests and our objections to them.  If we cannot come to agreement, then we will be allowed to renew our motions, on or before October 31, 2016.
