TENNANT COMPANY 
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  (In thousands, except shares and per share data) 
   
           1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) requirements for interim reporting, which allows certain footnotes and other financial information normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to be condensed or omitted. In our opinion, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. 
  These statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
   
           2. 
    Management Actions 
     During the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring action to reduce our infrastructure costs that we anticipated would improve Selling and Administrative Expense operating leverage in future quarters. The pre-tax charge of   $1,779   recognized in the third quarter of 2015 consisted primarily of severance, the majority of which was in Europe, and was included within Selling and Administrative Expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe the anticipated savings will offset the pre-tax charge in approximately   one year   from the date of the action. The charge impacted our Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) operating segments. We do not expect additional costs will be incurred related to this restructuring action. 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented an additional restructuring action to reduce our infrastructure costs that we anticipated would improve Selling and Administrative Expense operating leverage in future quarters. The pre-tax charge of   $1,965  , including other associated costs of   $481  , consisted primarily of severance and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The pre-tax charge was included within Selling and Administrative Expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe the anticipated savings will offset the pre-tax charge in approximately   1.5 years   from the date of the action. The charge impacted our Americas, EMEA and APAC operating segments. We do not expect additional costs will be incurred related to this restructuring action. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability balances is as follows: 

3. 
    Acquisitions 
     On   July 28, 2016  , pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and real estate purchase agreement with   Crawford Laboratories, Inc. and affiliates thereof   ("Sellers"), we acquired selected assets and liabilities of the Seller's commercial floor coatings business, including the Florock        Polymer Flooring brand ("Florock"). Florock manufactures commercial floor coatings systems in Chicago, IL. The purchase price was   $12,065  , subject to customary working capital adjustments. The purchase price of   $12,065   is comprised of   $10,965   paid at closing, with the remaining   $1,100   to be paid within   6 months   of closing, subject to working capital and other adjustments per the purchase agreement.

     Table of Contents  

On   September 1, 2016  , we acquired selected assets and liabilities of   Dofesa Barrido Mecanizado   ("Dofesa"), which was our largest distributor in Mexico over many decades. The operations are based in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and their addition allows us to expand our sales and service network in an important market. The purchase price was   $5,000   less assumed liabilities of   $3,448  , subject to customary working capital adjustments. The net purchase price of   $1,552   is comprised of   $1,202   paid at closing, and a value added tax of   $191  , with the remaining   $350   to be paid within   60 days   of closing, subject to working capital adjustments. 
  The acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations and the results of their operations have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements since their respective dates of acquisition.     The impact of the incremental revenue and earnings recorded as a result of the acquisitions are not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   The purchase price allocations are preliminary and will be adjusted upon final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We expect that part of the Goodwill will be reallocated to Intangible Assets, such as Customer Lists and Trade Names, once our valuation process is complete. 
  The preliminary components of the purchase price of the business combinations described above have been allocated as follows: 

4. 
    Divestiture 
     On August 19, 2015, we adopted a plan to sell assets and liabilities of the Green Machines   TM    outdoor city cleaning line as a result of determining that the product line, which constituted approximately   two percent   of our total sales, did not sufficiently complement our core business. Further details regarding the assets and liabilities held for sale as of   December 31, 2015   are described in Note 6 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  On   January 19, 2016  , we signed a Business Purchase Agreement ( BPA ) with Green Machines International GmbH and Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited ("the Buyers"), subsidiaries of M F Management and Financing GmbH, which is also the parent company of the master distributor of our products in Central Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, TCS EMEA GmbH, for the sale of our Green Machines       outdoor city cleaning line. Per the terms of the BPA, the sale closed on   January 31, 2016  . Including working capital adjustments, the aggregate consideration for the Green Machines business was   $5,774  . On   October 25, 2016  , we signed Amendment No. 1 to the BPA ("Amended BPA") with the Buyers. Under the Amended BPA, the total aggregate consideration will be paid as follows: 
             
    Initial cash consideration of   $285  , which was received during the first quarter of 2016. 
                
    The remaining purchase price of   $5,489   will be financed and received in   16   equal installments on the last business day of each quarter, commencing with the quarter ended   March 31, 2018  .  
     In the first   nine   months of   2016  , as a result of this divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax loss of   $149   in our Profit from Operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of the recorded loss and the sale of Green Machines is not material to our earnings as Green Machines only accounted for approximately   two percent   of our total sales. 
  Subsequent to the closing date, we have been acting as a distributor for Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited by continuing to sell Green Machines in some regions, primarily certain countries in the Americas and APAC, and will also serve as the exclusive service provider for Green Machines worldwide. Net of this estimated revenue, the divestiture is anticipated to reduce Tennant's annual revenue by approximately one percent, with an immaterial impact on earnings. 
  We have identified Green Machines International GmbH as a variable interest entity ( VIE ) and have performed a qualitative assessment to determine if Tennant is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidation of the VIE is not considered necessary.

    Inventories 
     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

The LIFO reserve approximates the difference between LIFO carrying cost and FIFO. 
   
           6. 
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
     The changes in the carrying value of Goodwill for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The balances of acquired Intangible Assets, excluding Goodwill, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

The addition to Goodwill during the first   nine   months of   2016   was based on the preliminary purchase price allocation of our acquisition of the Florock       brand and the assets of Dofesa Barrido Mecanizado, as described further in Note 3.  
  The accumulated amortization balances for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included fully impaired customer lists, trade name and technology intangible assets that were impaired as a result of our decision to hold the assets and liabilities of the Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line for sale in   2015  .

Amortization expense on Intangible Assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $99   and   $323  , respectively. Amortization expense on Intangible Assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $332   and   $1,368  , respectively. 
  Estimated aggregate amortization expense based on the current carrying value of amortizable Intangible Assets for each of the five succeeding years and thereafter is as follows: 

Debt outstanding is summarized as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had committed lines of credit totaling   $125,000   and uncommitted credit facilities totaling   $87,246  . There were   $25,000   in outstanding borrowings under our JPMorgan facility (described below) and   $11,143   in outstanding borrowings under our Prudential facility (described below) as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, we had stand alone letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of   $3,370  . Commitment fees on unused lines of credit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $166  . 
  Our most restrictive covenants are part of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan (as defined below), which are the same covenants in the Shelf Agreement (as defined below) with Prudential (as defined below), and require us to maintain an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of not greater than   3.25 to 1   and to maintain an EBITDA to interest expense ratio of no less than   3.50 to 1   as of the end of each quarter. As of   September 30, 2016  , our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was   0.53 to 1   and our EBITDA to interest expense ratio was   68.37 to 1  . 
  Credit Facilities

  Details regarding our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2015, between us and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent and collateral agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as syndication agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and the Lenders (including JPMorgan) from time to time party thereto (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") are described in Note 9 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $11,143   in outstanding borrowings under the Shelf Agreement, consisting of   $4,000   of Series A notes issued in March 2011 with a fixed interest rate of   4.00%   and a term of   seven years  , with remaining serial maturities from   2017   to   2018  , and the   $7,143   Series B notes issued in June 2011 with a fixed interest rate of   4.10%   and a term of   10 years  , with remaining serial maturities from   2017   to   2021  . The third payment of   $2,000   on Series A notes was made during the first quarter of   2016  . The second payment of   $1,429   on Series B notes was made during the second quarter of   2016  . We were in compliance with all covenants under the Shelf Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . The issuance period, under the current terms of the Shelf Agreement, expires on   June 30, 2018  . 
  The Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A. 
  On   September 14, 2010  , we entered into an overdraft facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland Citizens, N.A. in the amount of    2,000  , or approximately   $2,246  . There was   no   balance outstanding on this facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch 
  On June 20, 2012, we entered into a banking facility with the HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch in the amount of   $5,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings on this facility. 
   
   We record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale. The amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales, the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim, new product introductions and other factors. Warranty terms on machines generally range from   one   to   four   years. However, the majority of our claims are paid out within the first   six   to   nine   months following a sale. The majority of the liability for estimated warranty claims represents amounts to be paid out in the near term for qualified warranty issues, with immaterial amounts reserved to be paid for older equipment warranty issues. 
  The changes in warranty reserves for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

9. 
    Derivatives 
     Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs 
  We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. 
  We evaluate hedge effectiveness on our hedges that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedge prospectively, as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Balance Sheet Hedging   Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities 
  We hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value recorded to Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the notional amounts of foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding not designated as hedging instruments were   $40,073   and   $45,851  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Cash Flow Hedging   Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Transactions 
  In countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to   one year  . We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were   $2,687   and   $2,486   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency option contracts designated as cash flow hedges were   $8,116   and   $11,271   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to Net Sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event the hedge becomes ineffective, the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The fair value of derivative instruments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

     Fair Value Measurements 
     Estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the accounting guidance for fair value measurements. The framework defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The framework discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The framework utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 
             
    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
     
   13 

     Table of Contents  

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions. 
     Our population of assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements at   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Our foreign currency forward and option exchange contracts are valued using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. Further details regarding our foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts are discussed in Note 9. 
  The carrying amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Accounts Receivable, Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
  The fair value of our Long-Term Debt approximates cost based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and remaining maturities. 
  From time to time, we measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including evaluation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment using company-specific assumptions that would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
           11. 
    Retirement Benefit Plans 
     Our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plan are described in Note 13 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . We have contributed   $102   and   $381   during the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $311   and   $845   during the first   nine   months of   2016   to our pension plans and to our postretirement medical plan, respectively.  
  The components of the net periodic (benefit) cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions, which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. As of   September 30, 2016  , of those leases that contain residual value guarantees, the aggregate residual value at lease expiration was   $13,814  , of which we have guaranteed   $11,143  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we have recorded a liability for the estimated end of term loss related to this residual value guarantee of   $333   for certain vehicles within our fleet. Our fleet also contains vehicles we estimate will settle at a gain. Gains on these vehicles will be recognized at the end of the lease term. 
  During the first quarter of   2016  , we entered into a distributor agreement with Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited, an affiliate of Green Machines International GmbH, for the exclusive right for Tennant to distribute, market, sell, rent and lease Green Machines products, aftermarket parts and consumables in the Americas and APAC. As part of this distributor agreement, we entered into a purchase commitment obligating us to purchase   $12,000   of products and aftermarket parts and consumables annually for the next   two years  , for a total purchase commitment of   $24,000  . Per the terms of Amendment No. 1 to the distributor agreement signed on   October 25, 2016  , this purchase commitment has been removed, and we have surrendered our right to distribute Green Machines products and parts in certain APAC and Latin American countries. 
  On March 23, 2016, we entered into a   four   year Joint Development Agreement with a partner to develop software. As part of that agreement we have committed to spend   $3,000   during the first year of the agreement and   $8,000   over the life of the agreement, subject to regular time and materials billing and achievement of contract milestones.

     Table of Contents  

The changes in components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, are as follows: 

We and our subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for taxable years before   2013   and, with limited exceptions, state and foreign income tax examinations for taxable years before   2007  . 
  We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income Tax Expense. In addition to the liability of   $2,463   for unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $475   for accrued interest and penalties. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of   September 30, 2016   was   $2,075  . To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be revised and reflected as an adjustment of the Income Tax Expense. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by   $442   during the first   nine   months of   2016   for the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and settlement with tax authorities. 
  We are currently undergoing income tax examinations in various state and foreign jurisdictions covering   2007   to   2014  . Although the final outcome of these examinations cannot be currently determined, we believe that we have adequate reserves with respect to these examinations. 
   
           15. 
    Share-Based Compensation 
     Our share-based compensation plans are described in Note 17 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized total Share-Based Compensation Expense of   $1,321   and   $1,691  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized total Share-Based Compensation Expense of   $5,747   and   $6,580  , respectively. The total excess tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation arrangements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $447   and   $707  , respectively. 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we granted   27,921   restricted shares. The weighted average grant date fair value of each share awarded was   $53.02  . Restricted share awards generally have a   three   year vesting period from the effective date of the grant. The total fair value of shares vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,835   and   $900  , respectively.

    Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
     The computations of Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share were as follows: 

Excluded from the dilutive securities shown above were options to purchase   313,711   and   746,206   shares of Common Stock during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Excluded from the dilutive securities shown above were options to purchase   382,075   and   242,874   shares of Common Stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These exclusions were made if the exercise prices of the options are greater than the average market price of our Common Stock for the period, if the number of shares we can repurchase under the treasury stock method exceeds the weighted average shares outstanding in the options or if we have a net loss, as these effects are anti-dilutive. 
   
   We are organized into   four   operating segments: North America; Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. We combine our North America and Latin America operating segments into the  Americas  for reporting Net Sales by geographic area. In accordance with the objective and basic principles of the applicable accounting guidance, we aggregate our operating segments into   one   reportable segment that consists of the design, manufacture and sale of products used primarily in the maintenance of nonresidential surfaces. 
  Net Sales attributed to each geographic area for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:  

Net Sales are attributed to each geographic area based on the country from which the product was shipped and are net of intercompany sales.

    Related Party Transactions 
     During the first quarter of   2008  , we acquired Sociedade Alfa Ltda. and entered into lease agreements for certain properties owned by or partially owned by the former owners of this entity. Some of these individuals are current employees of Tennant. Lease payments made under these lease agreements are not material to our financial position or results of operations.

On     October 25, 2016  , we signed Amendment No. 1 to the Business Purchase Agreement with Green Machines International GmbH and Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited, buyers of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line. See Note 4 for details of the Green Machines divestiture.     The Amended BPA finalized the working capital adjustment and amended the payment terms for the remaining purchase price as described in Note 4 to these financial statements. Also on   October 25, 2016  , we signed Amendment No. 1 to the distributor agreement with Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited, whereby we waived our exclusive rights to distribute Green Machine products and parts in specified APAC and Latin America countries, and our obligation to purchase   $24,000   of Green Machines products, parts and consumables over   24 months   from January 2016 was canceled. On   October 25, 2016  , in connection with the amended distributor agreement, we provided a   $2,000   non-interest bearing cash advance to TCS EMEA GmbH, the master distributor of our products in Central Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, who is an affiliate of Green Machine Sweepers UK Limited. The cash advance is repayable in   36   equal installments beginning in January 2017.

  Net Earnings for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $11.5 million  , or   $0.64   per diluted share, as compared to a Net Loss of   $1.0 million  , or   $0.05   per diluted share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Operating Profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $16.3 million  , or   8.1%   of Net Sales, as compared to Operating Profit of   $4.6 million  , or   2.2%   of Net Sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Operating Profit during the third quarter of 2016 was $11.7 million higher due primarily to the 2015 third quarter $11.2 million pre-tax non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines   TM    assets as held for sale and also a $1.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge included in the 2015 Selling   Administrative ("S A") Expense to reduce our infrastructure costs. Due to the strengthening of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in the 2016 third quarter, foreign currency exchange increased Operating Profit by approximately $0.5 million. These favorable impacts were offset by unfavorable impacts resulting from lower Net Sales and Gross Profit due primarily to lower sales volume in our Asia Pacific ( APAC ) region and our Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) region (due in part to our Green Machines divestiture).  
  Net Earnings for the first     nine     months of     2016     were     $31.2 million  , or     $1.74     per diluted share, as compared to Net Earnings of      $18.9 million  , or     $1.01     per diluted share, in the first     nine     months of     2015  . Operating Profit for the first     nine     months of     2016     was     $45.9 million  , or     7.7%     of Net Sales, as compared to Operating Profit of     $35.4 million  , or     5.8%     of Net Sales, in the first     nine     months of     2015  .     Operating Profit during the first nine months of 2016 was $10.5 million higher due primarily to the 2015 third quarter $11.2 million pre-tax non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines   TM    assets as held for sale and also a $1.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge included in the 2015 S A Expense. These favorable impacts were offset by unfavorable impacts resulting from lower Net Sales and Gross Profit due primarily to lower sales volume in our APAC region and our EMEA region (due in part to our Green Machines divestiture). Due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the first nine months of 2016, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $1.6 million.

Net Loss for the third quarter of 2015 was $1.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, as compared to Net Earnings of $11.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2014. The Net Loss in the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to the $11.2 million pre-tax, or $0.64 per diluted share after-tax, non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines assets as held for sale. There was also a related restructuring charge included in the S A Expense of $1.8 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per diluted share after-tax, to reduce our infrastructure costs. Operating Profit for the third quarter of 2015 was $4.6 million, or 2.2% of Net Sales, as compared to Operating Profit of $17.1 million, or 8.4% of Net Sales, in the third quarter of 2014. Operating Profit during the third quarter of 2015 was unfavorably impacted by $13.0 million, or 640 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and the related restructuring charge. Operating Profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher Research and Development ( R D ) Expense of $1.4 million as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in the 2015 third quarter, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $4.2 million. 
  Net Earnings for the first nine months of 2015 were $18.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as compared to Net Earnings of $33.1 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2014. The lower Net Earnings in the first nine months of 2015 was primarily due to the $11.2 million pre-tax, or $0.62 per diluted share after-tax, non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as a result of the classification of our Green Machines assets as held for sale in the third quarter of 2015. There was also a related restructuring charge included in the 2015 third quarter S A Expense of $1.8 million pre-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share after-tax, to reduce our infrastructure costs. Operating Profit for the first nine months of 2015 was $35.4 million, or 5.8% of Net Sales, as compared to Operating Profit of $49.5 million, or 8.2% of Net Sales, in the first nine months of 2014. Operating Profit during the first nine months of 2015 was unfavorably impacted by $13.0 million, or 220 basis points as a percentage of Net Sales, for the non-cash Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and the related restructuring charge. Operating Profit was unfavorably impacted by higher R D Expense of $2.3 million as compared to the first nine months of 2014. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of 2015, foreign currency exchange reduced Operating Profit by approximately $9.5 million.

Net Sales 
  Consolidated Net Sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled   $200.1 million  , a   2.3%   decrease as compared to consolidated Net Sales of   $204.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Consolidated Net Sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled   $596.8 million  , a   1.5%   decrease as compared to consolidated Net Sales of   $605.9 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  The components of the consolidated Net Sales change for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   were as follows: 

The   2.3%     decrease   in consolidated Net Sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was driven by: 
             
    An organic sales decrease of approximately   2.2%   which excludes the effects of foreign currency exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, due to an approximate   2.2%   volume decrease. The volume decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of industrial equipment in all regions, which more than offset higher sales to strategic accounts and sales of new products in the Americas region. Sales of new products introduced within the past three years totaled 40% of equipment revenue for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to 24% of equipment revenue in the 2015 third quarter from sales of new products introduced within the past three years. There was essentially no price increase in the 2016 third quarter due to no significant new selling list price increases and now lapping the prior year selling price list increase with an effective date of February 1, 2015. We currently do not anticipate any significant inflation, and therefore, we do not anticipate any material selling list price increases in 2016 and we expect an immaterial increase to Net Sales for the 2016 full year. 
                
    An unfavorable net impact of   0.1%   resulting from the sale of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line, partially offset by the expansion of our commercial floor coatings business through the acquisition of the Florock        brand. 
     The   1.5%   decrease in consolidated Net Sales in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was driven by: 
             
    An unfavorable direct foreign currency translation exchange impact of approximately   1.0%  . 
                
    An unfavorable net impact of   0.6%   resulting from the sale of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line, partially offset by the acquisition of the Florock brand. 
                
    An organic sales increase of approximately   0.1%   which excludes the effects of foreign currency exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, due to an approximate   0.1%   volume increase. The volume increase was primarily due to sales to strategic accounts and sales of new products, particularly in the Americas region, being somewhat offset by lower sales within the EMEA and APAC regions and lower sales of commercial equipment. Sales of new products introduced within the past three years totaled 37% of equipment revenue in the first nine months of 2016. This compares to 19% of equipment revenue in the first nine months of 2015 from sales of new products introduced within the past three years. The price increase, primarily occurring in the first quarter of 2016, was the result of selling list price increases, typically in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in most geographies, with an effective date of February 1, 2015. The impact to gross margin is estimated to be minimal as these selling price increases were taken to offset inflation. There was essentially no price increase in the first nine months of 2016 due to no significant new selling list price increases and now lapping the prior year selling price list increase with an effective date of February 1, 2015. We currently do not anticipate any significant inflation, and therefore, we do not anticipate any material selling list price increases in 2016 and we expect an immaterial increase to Net Sales for the 2016 full year.

The following table sets forth the Net Sales by geographic area for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the percentage change from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages): 

Americas 
  Net Sales in the Americas were   $152.3 million   and   $449.7 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , an increase of   2.2%   and   1.2%  , respectively, from the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . Organic sales in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   were driven by sales to strategic accounts, new products and strong sales in Latin America. Sales in the third quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by productivity challenges in North America that resulted in a larger than normal order backlog at quarter end. The direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects within the Americas did not materially impact Net Sales during the third quarter of 2016. The direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 1.0% during the first nine months of 2016. In addition, the direct impact of the Florock acquisition favorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 1.0% and 0.3% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. As a result, organic sales increased approximately 1.2% and 1.9% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. 
  Europe, Middle East and Africa 
  In our markets within EMEA, Net Sales decreased   15.1%   to   $29.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the first nine months of 2016, Net Sales decreased   8.2%  , compared to the first nine months of 2015.  In the third quarter of 2016, organic sales growth through distribution in Western Europe was more than offset by organic sales declines elsewhere, particularly in the U.K. where Brexit s negative impact on the economy, and the related devaluation of the British Pound, was larger than expected. In the first nine months of 2016, growth in organic sales to strategic accounts was more than offset by lower organic sales through the other sales channels. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, there was an unfavorable impact on Net Sales of approximately 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, as a result of the sale of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line in January 2016. In addition, the direct impact of foreign currency translation exchange effects within EMEA unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 2.5% in the third quarter of 2016 and by approximately 1.5% during the first nine months of 2016. As a result, organic sales decreased approximately 7.6% and 1.4% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. 
  Asia Pacific 
  Net Sales in the APAC region for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   totaled   $18.5 million   and   $52.7 million  , respectively, a decrease of   13.1%   and   10.2%   from the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively. Organic sales decreased approximately 15.1% in the third quarter due to lapping the particularly strong organic sales growth of approximately 21.3% in the third quarter of 2015, excluding the unfavorable direct foreign currency translation exchange impact of approximately 14.0%. Organic sales decreased approximately 9.7% in the first nine months of 2016 with organic sales growth in Japan being more than offset by sales declines in other Asian countries. Direct foreign currency translation exchange favorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 2.0% in the third quarter of 2016 and unfavorably impacted Net Sales by approximately 0.5% in the first nine months of 2016. 
   
  Gross Profit 
  Gross Profit in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $85.3 million  , or   42.6%   of Net Sales, as compared to   $88.7 million  , or   43.3%   of Net Sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Gross profit dollars decreased   3.8%   versus the prior year period due to lower Net Sales in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower Cost of Sales. Gross margin was   70   basis points     lower   in the third quarter of 2016   due primarily to productivity challenges in North America, related to a skilled labor shortage.

Gross Profit in the first     nine     months of     2016     was     $258.1 million  , or     43.2%     of Net Sales, compared to     $261.8 million  , or     43.2%     of Net Sales, in the first     nine     months of     2015  . Gross profit dollars decreased     1.4%     versus the prior year period due to lower Net Sales in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by lower Cost of Sales. Gross margin was equal to the prior year primarily due to a more favorable product mix (with relatively higher sales of industrial equipment and lower sales of commercial equipment), which was fully offset by the productivity challenges in North America during the third quarter of 2016 and foreign currency headwinds that unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points during the first nine months of 2016. 
   
  Operating Expense 
  Research   Development Expense 
  R D Expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $8.4   million, an increase of   2.6%   from   $8.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . R D Expense as a percentage of Net Sales was   4.2%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   4.0%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  R D Expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $24.7 million  , an increase of   1.6%   from   $24.3 million   in the same period in   2015  . R D Expense as a percentage of Net Sales was   4.1%   for the first nine months of   2016   as compared to   4.0%   for the first nine months of   2015  . 
  We continue to invest in developing innovative new products for our traditional core business, as well as in our Orbio Technologies Group, which is focused on advancing a suite of sustainable cleaning technologies. New products are a key driver of sales growth. There were eight new products and product variants launched in the first nine months of 2016 consisting of three models of emerging market floor machines, two models of the M17 battery-powered sweeper-scrubber, and three large next-generation cleaning machines: the M20 and M30 integrated sweeper-scrubbers, and the T20 heavy-duty industrial rider scrubber. For the full year 2016, we plan to introduce at least 10 new products, of which 8 were introduced in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  Selling   Administrative Expense 
  S A Expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased   6.3%   to   $60.6   million, as compared to   $64.7   million in the   third   quarter of   2015  . S A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales was   30.3%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a decrease of   130   basis points from   31.6%   in the comparable   2015   quarter.  
  S A Expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   1.8%   to   $187.3 million  , as compared to   $190.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  . S A Expense as a percentage of Net Sales was   31.4%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , a decrease of   10   basis points from   31.5%   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  The decrease in S A Expense in the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the favorable impacts from cost controls and improved operating efficiencies. In addition, the S A Expense in the third quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by the $1.8 million restructuring charge we recorded in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce our infrastructure costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by investments in high priority growth initiatives. 
  Loss on Sale of Business 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we completed the sale of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line. The   $0.1 million   loss recognized on the transaction was not material to our financial statements. 
   
  Other Expense, Net 
  Interest Income 
  There was no significant change in Interest Income in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  .  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest Expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $0.3 million  , as compared to   $0.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The higher Interest Expense in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter   2015   was primarily due to incurring   $15.0 million   of Long-Term Debt during the   third   quarter of   2016   related to recent acquisitions. Interest Expense in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $0.9 million   as compared to   $1.0 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The lower Interest Expense in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to a lower level of debt for the first half of the year.

Net Foreign Currency Transaction (Losses) Gains 
  Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses in the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $0.1 million  , as compared to Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses of   $0.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net Foreign Currency Transaction Gains in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $0.2 million  , as compared to Net Foreign Currency Transaction Losses of   $0.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The favorable change in the impact from foreign currency transactions in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016 was due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and settlement of transactional hedging activity in the normal course of business. 
  Other Expense, Net 
  There was no significant change in Other Expense, Net in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  .  
   
  Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 27.7%, as compared to the effective tax rate in the third quarter of the prior year of 124.1%. The tax expense for the third quarter of 2015 included a $0.3 million tax expense associated with an $11.2 million Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and a $0.2 million tax benefit associated with a $1.8 million restructuring charge. Excluding these items, the third quarter 2015 overall effective tax rate would have been 28.3%. 
  The year-to-date overall effective tax rate was 30.6% for 2016 compared to 43.1% for 2015. Excluding the effects of the impairment and restructuring charge, the 2015 year-to-date overall effective tax rate would have been 30.7%. 
  The decrease in the overall effective tax rate to 30.6% in 2016 compared to 30.7% in 2015, excluding the 2015 special items, was primarily related to the mix in expected full year taxable earnings by country and the Federal R D tax credit, which was reenacted in December 2015. The 2015 third quarter and first nine months year-to-date tax rates did not include any benefit for the Federal R D tax credit as we are not allowed to consider the credit in our tax rate until it was formally reenacted. 
  We do not have any plans to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Any repatriation from foreign subsidiaries that would result in incremental taxation is not being considered. It is management's belief that reinvesting these earnings outside the U.S. is the most efficient use of capital. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled   $42.3   million at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $51.3   million as of   December 31, 2015  . Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed. Our current ratio was   2.3   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2.2   as of   December 31, 2015  , and our working capital was   $158.7   million and   $160.4 million  , respectively. Our debt-to-capital ratio was   11.7%   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared with   8.9%   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Cash Flow Summary 
  Cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized as follows (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Operating Activities 
  Operating activities   provided     $33.3 million   of cash for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Cash   provided by     operating activities was driven primarily by cash inflows from Net Earnings of   $31.2 million  , a decrease in Accounts Receivable of   $5.8 million   and a net cash inflow from Income Taxes of   $2.2 million  . These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows resulting from a decrease in Accounts Payable and Employee Compensation and Benefits liabilities of   $6.4 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively, a net cash outflow from Other Assets and Liabilities of   $5.2 million  , an increase in Inventories of   $4.9 million   and a decrease in Other Current Liabilities of   $3.1 million  . 
  Operating activities provided $30.9 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by cash inflows resulting from Net Earnings of $18.9 million, which includes a pre-tax impairment charge of $11.2 million, a decrease in Accounts Receivable of $6.7 million and an increase in Employee Compensation and Benefits liabilities of $2.4 million, partially offset by cash outflows from an increase in Inventories of $14.7 million and a decrease in Accounts Payable of $4.7 million. 
  Management evaluates how effectively we utilize two of our key operating assets, Accounts Receivable and Inventories, using Accounts Receivable  Days Sales Outstanding  (DSO) and  Days Inventory on Hand  (DIOH), on a FIFO basis. The metrics are calculated on a rolling three month basis in order to more readily reflect changing trends in the business. These metrics for the quarters ended were as follows (in days):    

As of   September 30, 2016  , DSO increased 1 day as compared to   September 30, 2015   and increased 3 days as compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of terms offered and mix of business, somewhat offset by continued proactive management of our receivables by enforcing tighter credit limits and continuing to successfully collect past due balances. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , DIOH increased 1 day as compared to   September 30, 2015   and increased 5 days as compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to increased levels of inventory in support of higher anticipated sales levels and the launches of new products, somewhat offset by progress from inventory reduction initiatives. 
  Investing Activities 
  Investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   used   $33.9   million. Net capital expenditures used   $21.9 million   and our acquisition of the Florock       brand and the assets of Dofesa Barrido Mecanizado, a long-time distributor based in central Mexico, used   $12.4 million  , net of cash acquired, as described further in Note 3. This was partially offset by proceeds of   $0.3 million   from the sale of our Green Machines outdoor city cleaning line, as described further in Note 4, as well as proceeds of   $0.1 million   from a decrease in our Restricted Cash balance. Capital expenditures included investments in information technology process improvement projects, tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing equipment. 
  Investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 used $13.5 million. Net capital expenditures used $14.3 million. This was partially offset by continued proceeds of $1.2 million from the sale of a business in 2012. Capital expenditures included investments in information technology process improvement projects, tooling related to new product development, and manufacturing equipment. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $8.5 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016  . The purchases of our Common Stock per our authorized repurchase program used   $12.8 million  , dividend payments used   $10.6 million   and the payments of Long-Term Debt used   $3.5 million  , partially offset by proceeds from the incurrence of Long-Term Debt of   $15.0 million  , the issuance of Common Stock of   $2.9 million   and the excess tax benefit on stock plans of   $0.4 million  . 
  Net cash used by financing activities was $51.8 million during the first nine months of 2015. The purchases of our Common Stock per our authorized repurchase program used $39.1 million, dividend payments used $11.0 million and the payment of Long-Term Debt used $3.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of $1.0 million and the excess tax benefit on stock plans of $0.7 million.

Newly Issued Accounting Guidance 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This ASU will replace all existing revenue recognition standards and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year from the original effective date specified in ASU No. 2014-09. The guidance permits us to apply the new revenue recognition standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU changes current U.S. GAAP for lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2019, including interim periods. Early application is permitted. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The transition approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. A full retrospective transition approach is prohibited for both lessees and lessors. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU modified U.S. GAAP by requiring the following, among others: (1) all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement (excess tax benefits are recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period); (2) excess tax benefits are to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; (3) in the area of forfeitures, an entity can still follow the current U.S. GAAP practice of making an entity-wide accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or may instead account for forfeitures when they occur; and (4) classification as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows of cash paid by an employer to the taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2017, including interim periods. Early application is permitted. Management does not expect the standard to have a significant impact on our current year results. We plan to early adopt this ASU during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   Among other things, the ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Companies will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2020. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which is our fiscal 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

    Controls and Procedures 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures for the period ended   September 30, 2016   (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and our principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
     On June 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. Share repurchases are made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, primarily to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued through our share-based compensation programs. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Shelf Agreement restrict the payment of dividends or repurchasing of stock if, after giving effect to such payments, our leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1, in such case limiting such payments to an amount ranging from $50.0 million to $75.0 million during any fiscal year. If our leverage ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1, our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Shelf Agreement restrict us from paying any dividends or repurchasing stock, after giving effect to such payments. 

(1)   
    Includes 2,207 shares delivered or attested to in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by employees who exercised stock options or restricted stock under employee share-based compensation plans.
