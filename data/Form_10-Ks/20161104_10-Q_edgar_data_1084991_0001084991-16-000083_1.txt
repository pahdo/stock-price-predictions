Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

(1) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  These notes apply to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. a Colorado corporation (the "Company",  NGSG , "Natural Gas Services Group", "we" or "our").   
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary to make our financial position at   September 30, 2016   and the results of our operations for the three months and nine months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   not misleading.  As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures normally required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP).  These financial statements should be read in conjunction     with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   on file with the SEC.  In our opinion, the condensed consolidated financial statements are a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
    
  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenue from the sales of custom and fabricated compressors, and flare systems is recognized when title passes to the customer, the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery occurs as directed by our customer. From time to time, we have customers that request units and flares to be built under a bill and hold arrangement. In order to recognize revenue under a bill and hold arrangement the following criteria must be met: risk of ownership was passed to the customer, customer made a fixed commitment to purchase the goods, the customer requested the bill and hold, there was a fixed schedule for delivery, we no longer had any specific performance obligations, the purchase was segregated at our facility and the equipment was complete and ready to ship. As of   September 30, 2016  , we recognized revenue of   $4.4   million under these bill and hold arrangements. Exchange and rebuilt compressor revenue is recognized when the replacement compressor has been delivered and the rebuild assessment has been completed.  Revenue from compressor service and retrofitting services is recognized upon providing services to the customer.  Maintenance agreement revenue is recognized as services are rendered.  Rental revenue is recognized over the terms of the respective rental agreements.  Deferred income represents payments received before a product is shipped.  Revenue from the sale of rental units is included in sales revenue when equipment is shipped or title is transferred to the customer.  
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, deferred compensation plan (cash portion) and our line of credit.  Pursuant to ASC 820 (Accounting Standards Codification), the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their fair values because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or durations. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, seeking to eliminate diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this accounting standard on our financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU identifies areas for simplification involving several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, classifications on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The provisions of this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted provided that presentation is applied to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements.  
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as part of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to clarify revenue-recognizing principles and develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU No. 2014-09 finalizes Proposed ASU Nos. 1820-100, 2011-230 and 2011-250 and is expected, among other things, to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In particular, the amendments in this ASU will be added to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) as Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as some cost guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize  revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligation in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09, by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 which further clarifies the guidance on the principal versus agent considerations within ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 to expand the guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing within ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 to clarify the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract ,the guidance for recognizing sales taxes and similar taxes and the timing for measuring customers payments that are not in cash within ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Additionally, an entity should apply the amendments either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter, transition method, then it must also provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of initial application of (1) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and (2) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the new standard to determine which reporting option allows us to report the most meaningful information and are still evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements.

(2) Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Stock Options: 
    
  A summary of option activity under our 1998 Stock Option Plan  as  of   December 31, 2015  , and changes during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below. 

The following table summarizes information about our stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016  : 

The summary of the status of our unvested stock options as of   December 31, 2015   and changes during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $367,232   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options.  Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   one   year. Total compensation expense for stock options was   $388,732   and   $429,925   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Restricted Stock: 
    
  In accordance with the Company's employment agreement with Stephen Taylor, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee reviewed his performance in determining the issuance of restricted common stock.  Based on this review which included consideration of the Company's   2015   performance, Mr. Taylor, was awarded   75,915   restricted shares on   January 6, 2016  , which vest over   two years  , in equal installments, beginning January 6, 2017. On April 6,   2016  , the Compensation Committee awarded   20,000   shares of restricted common stock to each of G. Larry Lawrence, our CFO, and James Hazlett, our Vice President of Technical Services. The restricted shares to Messrs. Hazlett and Lawrence vest over   two years  , in equal installments, beginning April 6, 2017.  We also awarded and issued   23,536   shares of restricted common stock to our Board of Directors as partial payment for   2016   directors' fees.  The restricted stock issued to our directors vests over   one   year, in quarterly installments, beginning March 31,   2017  . Total compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was   $1,350,427   and   $2,186,330   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a total of   $2,077,829   of unrecognized compensation expense related to these shares which is expected to be recognized over the next   two   years. 

(3) Inventory 
    
  Our inventory, net of allowance for obsolescence of  $  44,000   and   $12,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consisted of the following amounts: 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were   no   write-offs of obsolete inventory against the allowance for obsolescence. 

(4) Retirement of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  As a result of a decline in market conditions during the first half of 2015, management reviewed our rental compressor units that were not of the type, configuration, make or model that our customers were demanding or that were not cost efficient to refurbish, maintain and operate. As a result of that review, we determined that   258   units representing total horsepower of   32,259   should be retired from our rental fleet with key components from those units being re-utilized in future unit builds and/or repairs. We performed an optimization review and recorded a   $4.4 million   loss on the retirement of rental equipment to reduce the book value of each unit to the estimated aggregate fair value of approximately   $967,000   for the key components being kept. The retirement was recorded in second quarter of 2015.   No   retirements have been made in 2016. 

(5) Deferred Compensation Plans 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for executive officers, directors and certain eligible employees. The assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to additional risk of loss in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The plan allows for deferral up to   90%   of a participant s base salary, bonus, commissions, director fees and restricted stock awards. A Company owned life insurance policy held in a rabbi trust is utilized as a source of funding for the plan. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policy is   $149,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , with a gain related to the policy of   $7,000   reported in other income in our condensed consolidated income statement for the nine months ending   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  For deferrals of base salary, bonus, commissions and director fees, settlement payments are made to participants in cash, either in a lump sum or in periodic installments. The deferred obligation to pay the deferred compensation and the deferred director  
  
    7 

fees is adjusted to reflect the positive or negative performance of investment measurement options selected by each participant and was   $151,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . The deferred obligation is included in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
    
  For deferrals of restricted stock, the plan does not allow for diversification, therefore, distributions are paid in shares and the obligation is carried at grant value. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares had been deferred. 

(6) Credit Facility 
    
  We have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the "Amended Credit Agreement" with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the "Lender") with an aggregate commitment of   $30 million  , subject to collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the Lender, on an uncommitted basis, an increase of up to   $20 million   on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase the commitment amount to   $50 million  ).  
    
  Borrowing Base  . At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a)   80%   of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b)   50%   of the book value of our eligible general inventory (not to exceed   50%   of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c)   75%   of the book value of our eligible equipment inventory.  The Lender may adjust the borrowing base components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral. We had $  29.5 million   borrowing base availability at   September 30, 2016   under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement. 
    
  Interest and Fees  .  Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either (a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin ( LIBOR-based ), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable Margin; provided, however, that no more than   three   LIBOR-based borrowings under the agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate, the Applicable Margin is   1.50%  . For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is   1.50%  . For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate was   1.81%  . 
    
  Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and legal costs. 
    
  Maturity   . The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is   December 31, 2017  , at which time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the occurrence of an event of default.  
    
  Security  . The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of which must be maintained at a minimum of   2.00   to   1.00   commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.) 
    
  Covenants.   The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts; pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain on a consolidated basis a leverage ratio less than or equal to   2.50   to   1.00   as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. 
    
  Events of Default and Acceleration.   The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the loan documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events or similar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of   $50,000  ; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of   $150,000  ; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any liens under the secured revolving credit facility.  Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default. 
  
    8 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement.  A default under our Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable.  Such default would likely limit our ability to access other credit. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 our outstanding balance on the line of credit was   $417,000  . 

(7) Earnings per Share 
    
  The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation  (in thousands, except per share data)  . 

In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase   52,500   shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from   $30.41   to   $33.36   were not included in the computation of dilutive income per share, due to their antidilutive effect. 
    
    In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase   105,833   shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from   $22.90   to   $33.36   were not included in the computation of dilutive income per share, due to their antidilutive effect. 
    
  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, options to purchase   107,500   shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from   $22.90   to   $33.36   were not included in the computation of dilutive income per share, due to their antidilutive effect.

(8) Segment Information 
    
  ASC 280-10-50,  Operating Segments", defines the characteristics of an operating segment as a) being engaged in business activity from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, b) being reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM) for decisions about resources to be allocated and assess its performance and c) having discrete financial information.  Although we look at our products to analyze the nature of our revenue, other financial information, such as certain costs and expenses, net income and EBITDA are not captured or analyzed by these categories.  Our CODM does not make resource allocation decisions or access the performance of the business based on these categories, but rather in the aggregate. Based on this, management believes that it operates in   one   business segment. 
     
  In their analysis of product lines as potential operating segments, management also considered ASC 280-10-50-11,  Aggregation Criteria , which allows for the aggregation of operating segments if the segments have similar economic characteristics and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas:  

The nature of the products and services; 

The nature of the production processes;  

The type or class of customer for their products and services;  

The methods used to distribute their products or provide their services; and 

The nature of the regulatory environment, if applicable. 
        
  We are engaged in the business of designing and manufacturing compressors and flares. Our compressors and flares are sold and rented to our customers. In addition, we provide service and maintenance on compressors in our fleet and to third parties.  These business activities are similar in all geographic areas.  Our manufacturing  process is essentially the same for the entire Company and is performed in-house at our facilities in Midland, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Our customers primarily consist of entities in the business of producing natural gas and crude oil.  The maintenance and service of our products is consistent across the entire Company and is performed via an internal fleet of vehicles.  The regulatory environment is similar in every jurisdiction in that the most impacting regulations and practices are the result of federal energy policy.  In addition, the economic characteristics of each customer arrangement are similar in that we maintain policies at the corporate level.

(9)  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.  While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any threatened material litigation.

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The discussion and analysis of our financial     condition and results of operations are based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed, consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report and  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC. 
    
  Overview 
    
  We fabricate, manufacture, rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment. Our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors. Our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to 24 months. After the initial term of our rental contracts, most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month-to-month basis. Rental amounts are billed monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   1,387   natural gas compressors totaling   196,721   horsepower rented to   79   customers compared to   1,922   natural gas compressors totaling   267,202   horsepower rented to   89   customers at   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  We also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers, designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought. Fabrication of compressors involves our purchase of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and our assembling of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. The major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an  as needed  basis, which presently requires a two to three month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors. However, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases. 
    
  We also manufacture a proprietary line of compressor frames, cylinders and parts, known as our CiP (Cylinder-in-Plane) product line. We use finished CiP component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators. We also design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock varying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business. 
    
  We provide service and maintenance to our customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as-required basis in the absence of a service contract. Maintenance agreements typically have terms of   nine months to one year   and require payment of a monthly fee. 
    
  The oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature. The most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil and the corresponding changes in commodity prices. As demand and prices increase, oil and natural gas producers increase their capital expenditures for drilling, development and production activities. Generally, the increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment companies. 
    
  In general, we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the natural gas industry, with changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices more significantly affecting our business than changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices. However, we have increased our rental and sales in the non-conventional shale plays which are more dependent on crude oil prices.  We also believe that demand for compression services and products is driven by declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields and, more recently, by increased focus by producers on non-conventional natural gas production, such as coalbed methane, gas shales and tight gas, which typically requires more compression than production from conventional natural gas reservoirs. 
    
  Demand for our products and services have been historically strong. However, a decline in demand is experienced during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices. Low crude oil and natural gas prices experienced throughout 2015 have continued in the first   nine   months of 2016, with some price strengthening. Through much of this period, producers maintained their focus on non-conventional opportunities. The continued low price environment has caused reduced project spending on both conventional and non-conventional plays. While the timing of a return to aggressive investment in the projects is uncertain, we believe the long- 
  
    12 

term trend in our market is favorable.  We believe this outlook is supported by our ability to withstand temporary disruptions and position the Company for the long term.

Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The table below shows our revenues and percentage of total revenues of each of our product lines for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Total revenue   decreased   to   $16.2 million   from   $21.2 million  , or   24%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . The $  5.0 million   drop in revenue is due to rental units being returned in connection with the low oil and gas price environment. 
    
  Rental revenue   decreased   to   $13.2 million   from   $18.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   is due to the reduced demand from the drop in oil prices resulting in units being returned.  We ended the quarter with   2,626   compressor packages, down from   2,664   units at   September 30, 2015  .  The rental fleet had a utilization of   52.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   72.1  % utilization as of   September 30, 2015  .  This drop in utilization is mainly the result of compressor rental units being returned.  In the event that oil and natural gas prices increase, we should see an increase in the utilization of our fleet. 
    
  Sales revenue remained constant at   $2.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .   We had an increase in our compressors product line offset by a decrease in our flare sales during this comparative period. 
    
  Our overall operating income decreased   $2.0   million to   $1.8   million from   $3.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Operating margin percentage decreased to   11%   from   18%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The operating margin decreased due the reduction in total revenue. 
    
  Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased to   $2.1 million   from   $2.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to changing the vesting periods of newly issued restricted stock grants, from one to two years.   
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to   $5.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.6 million   for the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is the result of fewer units being added to the fleet, older units becoming fully depreciated and the retirement of 258 rental units during the second quarter of 2015. We added only   18   units over the past 12 months to our fleet.  
    
  Provision for income tax was   $322,000   and   $1.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in the provision is due to a decrease in taxable income and a change in effective tax rate between the two periods. The decrease in the provision is due to a decrease in taxable income which is largely driven by a decrease in revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015. 

14 

Nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The table below shows our revenues and percentage of total revenues of each of our product lines for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Total revenue   decreased   to   $55.0 million   from   $70.2 million  , or   21.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . Comparing the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the same period in   2015  , rental revenue   decreased     25%   and sales revenue   decreased     9%  . This decrease was due to rental units being returned in connection with the low oil and gas price environment and timing of unit sales. 
    
  Rental revenue   decreased   to   $44.2 million   from $  58.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   is the result of the decline in demand from the oil and natural gas industry, due to the continued depressed oil and gas prices.  We ended the quarter with   2,626   compressor packages in our rental fleet, down from   2,664   units at   September 30, 2015  .  The rental fleet had a utilization of   52.8%  , as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   72.1  % utilization as of   September 30, 2015  .  This utilization   decrease   mainly results from compressor returns reflecting the impact of the low price environment. In the event that oil and natural gas prices increase, we should see incremental utilization of our fleet. 
    
  Sales revenue   decreased   to   $9.7 million   from   $10.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   is the result of the inconsistent timing of industry activity related to capital projects.  We believe this timing is reflective of the typical sales cycle, resulting in inconsistent compressor units sales to third parties from our Tulsa and Midland operations. There was also a decrease in demand for flares during this comparative period. 
    
  Our overall operating income decreased   $3.0 million   to   $7.5 million   from   $10.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue.     Operating margin percentage decreased slightly to   14%   from   15%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . When excluding the rental fleet retirement for the comparative nine months, operating margin percentage for September 30, 2015 was 21%, this 7% decrease in margin is due to the reduction in total revenue.  
    
  As a result of a decline in market conditions, in 2015, management reviewed our rental compressor units and determined that 258 units should be retired (with certain key components being re-utilized), representing total horsepower of   32,259  . Based on this optimization review, at June 30, 2015, we recorded a $4.4 million non-cash loss on the retirement of rental equipment for the six months ended June 30, 2015, to reduce the book value to approximately $967,000, the estimated fair value of the key components being kept. This loss on the retirement of rental equipment is reported under operating costs and expenses in our condensed consolidated income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Selling, general, and administrative expense   decreased   to   $6.8 million   from   $8.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to changing the vesting periods of newly issued restricted stock grants, from one to two years.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased   to   $16.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17.2 million   for the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is the result of fewer units being added to the fleet, older units becoming fully depreciated and the retirement of 258 rental units during second quarter of 2015. We added only   18   units over the past 12 months to our fleet. 

15 

Provision for income tax   decreased   to   $2.2 million   from   $3.7 million  , or   41.0%  , and is the result of the   decrease   in taxable income and a change in effective tax rate between the two periods. The decrease in the provision is due to a decrease in taxable income which is largely driven  by a decrease in revenues, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  
    16 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our working capital positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are set forth below: 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we invested   $3.4 million   in equipment for our rental fleet and service vehicles.  Even though we have idle rental equipment, at times we do not have the specific type of equipment that our customers require, therefore we have to build new equipment to satisfy their needs.  We financed this activity with cash flow from operations and cash on hand.   
    
  Cash flows 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $61.2 million   compared to   $35.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Our cash flow from operations of   $29.5 million   was offset by capital expenditures of   $3.4 million  , during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We had working capital of   $86.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $68.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  On   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding debt of   $417,000  , which is all related to our line of credit and is classified as non-current. We had positive net cash flow from operating activities of   $29.5 million   during the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $34.8 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  .  The cash flow from operations of   $29.5 million   was primarily the result of the net income of   $5.3 million   and the non-cash items of depreciation of   $16.4 million  ,   $1.7 million   related to the expenses associated with stock options and restricted shares, an increase in working capital of   $7.9 million   and a decrease in deferred income taxes of   $1.8   million. 
    
  Strategy 
    
  For the remainder of the fiscal year   2016   and into   2017  , our overall plan is to continue monitoring and holding expenses in line with the anticipated level of activity, fabricate rental fleet equipment only in direct response to market requirements, emphasize marketing of our idle gas compressor units and limit bank borrowing in line with market conditions.  For the remainder of    2016  , our forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers  compression requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows and cash on hand.  Any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and/or addition or replacement of service vehicles.  We believe that cash flows from operations, our current cash position and our line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.  We may require additional capital to fund any unanticipated expenditures, including any acquisitions of other businesses, although that capital, beyond our line of credit, as discussed below may not be available to us when we need it or on acceptable terms.

Bank Borrowings 
    
  We have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the "Amended Credit Agreement" with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Lender") with an aggregate commitment of   $30 million  , subject to collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the lender, on an uncommitted basis, an increase of up to   $20 million   on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase the commitment amount to   $50 million  ).  
    
  Borrowing Base  .  At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a)   80%   of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b)   50%   of the book value of our eligible general inventory (not to exceed   50%   of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c)   75%   of the book value of our eligible equipment inventory. The Lender may adjust the borrowing base components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral. We had $  29.5 million   borrowing base availability at   September 30, 2016  , under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement. 
    
  Interest and Fees  .  Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either (a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin ( LIBOR-based ), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable Margin; provided, however, that no more than   three   LIBOR-based borrowings under the agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate, the Applicable Margin is   1.50%  . For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is   1.50%  . For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate was   1.81%  . 
    
  Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and legal costs. 
    
  Maturity.   The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is   December 31, 2017  , at which time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the occurrence of an event of default. 
    
  Security  . The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of must be maintained at a minimum of   2.00   to   1.00   commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.) 
    
  Covenants.   The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts; pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain on a consolidated basis a leverage ratio less than or equal to   2.50   to   1.00   as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. 
    
  Events of Default and Acceleration.   The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the loan documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events or similar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of   $50,000  ; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of   $150,000  ; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any liens under the secured revolving credit facility.  Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement.  A default under our Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable.  Such default would likely limit our ability to access other credit. At   September 30, 2016  , our balance on the line of credit was   $417,000  .  

18 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  We have contractual obligations and commitments that affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The following table is a summary of our significant cash contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)  For the   three   months remaining in   2016  . 
  (2)  Assumes an interest rate of 4.0% and no additional borrowings. 
  (3)  Vendor exclusive purchase agreement related to paint and costings. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Practices 
    
  There have been no changes in the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, seeking to eliminate diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this accounting standard on our financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is identifies areas for simplification involving several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, classifications on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The provisions of this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted provided that presentation is applied to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements. 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as part of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to clarify revenue-recognizing principles and develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU No. 2014-09 finalizes Proposed ASU Nos. 1820-100, 2011-230 and 2011-250 and is expected, among other things, to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In particular, the amendments in this ASU will be added to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) as Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as some cost guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which  
  
    19 

the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligation in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09, by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 which further clarifies the guidance on the principal versus agent considerations within ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 to expand the guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing within ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Additionally, an entity should apply the amendments either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter, transition method, then it must also provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of initial application of (1) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and (2) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the new standard to determine which reporting option allows us to report the most meaningful information and are still evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  From time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease agreements and purchase agreements.  We do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity, availability of, or requirements for, capital resources. 
                             
  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Except for historical information contained herein, the statements in this report are forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results.  Those risks include, among other things, the loss of market share through competition or otherwise; the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; a prolonged, substantial reduction in oil and natural gas prices which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services; and new governmental safety, health and environmental regulations which could require us to make significant capital expenditures.  The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q are only made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  A discussion of these and other risk factors is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  There have been no changes in the market risks disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or, the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.  Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements or omissions may be detected.  Those inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.  Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.  Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls. 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time, we are a party to various  legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.  While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any threatened litigation. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  Please refer to and read  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of the risks associated with our Company and industry.
