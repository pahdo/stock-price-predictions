  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   
  1. Formation and Organization 
  Organization   
    
  Spark Energy, Inc. ("Spark Energy," "Company," "we" or "us") is an independent retail energy services company that provides residential and commercial customers in competitive markets across the United States with an alternative choice for natural gas and electricity.  The Company is a holding company whose sole material asset consists of units in Spark HoldCo, LLC ( Spark HoldCo ).  Spark HoldCo owns all of the outstanding membership interests or shares in each of Spark Energy, LLC ( SE ), Spark Energy Gas, LLC ( SEG ), Oasis Power Holdings, LLC ("Oasis"), CenStar Energy Corp. ("CenStar"), Electricity Maine, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC and Provider Power Mass, LLC (collectively, the "Provider Companies"); and Major Energy Services, LLC, Major Energy Electric Services, LLC, and Respond Power, LLC (collectively, the "Major Energy Companies"), the operating subsidiaries through which the Company operates. The Company is the sole managing member of Spark HoldCo, is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Spark HoldCo s business and consolidates the financial results of Spark HoldCo and its subsidiaries. 
  SE is a licensed retail electric provider in multiple states.

  Oasis, through its operating subsidiary, Oasis Power LLC, is a retail energy provider formed on August 28, 2009 as a limited liability company under the TBOC. We acquired Oasis on July 31, 2015 from an affiliate. 
    
  CenStar is a retail energy provider incorporated on July 18, 2008 under the New York Business Corporation Law. We acquired CenStar on July 8, 2015. 
    
  The Provider Companies operate as retail energy providers. Electricity Maine, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC, and Provider Power Mass, LLC were formed on June 17, 2010, January 20, 2012 and August 22, 2012, respectively, as limited liability companies under the Maine Limited Liability Company Act. We acquired the Provider Companies on August 1, 2016. 
    
  The Major Energy Companies operate as retail energy providers. Major Energy Services, LLC, Major Energy Electric Services, LLC and Respond Power, LLC were formed on October 11, 2005, September 12, 2007 and July 11, 2008, respectively, as limited liability companies under the New York Limited Liability Company Law. We completed the purchase of all the outstanding membership interests of the Major Energy Companies on August 23, 2016 from an affiliate, as described in Note 2. 
    
  We are a Delaware corporation formed on April 22, 2014 for the purpose facilitating an initial public offering ("IPO") of our Class A common stock, par value   $0.01   per share ("Class A common stock"), and to become the sole managing member of, and to hold an ownership interest in, Spark HoldCo. In connection with our IPO, NuDevco Retail Holdings LLC ("NuDevco Retail Holdings") formed NuDevco Retail, LLC ( NuDevco Retail ), a single member limited liability company, on May 29, 2014, to hold the remaining Spark HoldCo units and shares of our Class B common stock, par value   $0.01   per share ("Class B common stock"). In January 2016, Retailco, LLC

     Table of Contents  

("Retailco") succeeded to the interest of NuDevco Retail Holdings of its Class B common stock and an equal number of Spark HoldCo units it held pursuant to a series of transfers. See Note   4    Equity  for further discussion. 
  W. Keith Maxwell, III is the owner of a majority in voting power of our common stock through his ownership of NuDevco Retail and Retailco. Retailco is a wholly owned subsidiary of TxEx Energy Investments, LLC ("TxEx"), which is wholly owned by Mr. Maxwell. NuDevco Retail is a wholly owned subsidiary of NuDevco Retail Holdings, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Electric HoldCo, LLC, which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of TxEx. 
    
  Emerging Growth Company Status 
    
  As a company with less than   $1.0 billion   in revenues during its last fiscal year, the Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements. 
    
  The Company will remain an  emerging growth company  until as late as the last day of the Company's 2019 fiscal year, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company has   $1.0 billion   or more in annual revenues; (ii) the date on which the Company becomes a  large accelerated filer  (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of the Company s common equity securities held by non-affiliates is   $700 million   or more as of June 30); (iii) the date on which the Company issues more than   $1.0 billion   of non-convertible debt over a   three  -year period. 
   As a result of the Company's election to avail itself of certain provisions of the JOBS Act, the information that the Company provides may be different than what you may receive from other public companies in which you hold an equity interest.  
  Exchange and Registration Rights 
    
  The Spark HoldCo Limited Liability Company Agreement provides that anytime the Company issues a new share of Class A or Class B common stock (except for issuances of Class A common stock upon an exchange of Class B common stock), Spark HoldCo will concurrently issue a limited liability company unit either to the holder of the Class B common stock or to the Company in the case of the issuance of shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the number of Spark HoldCo units held by the Company always equals the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. 
    
  Each share of Class B common stock, all of which are held by NuDevco Retail and Retailco, has no economic rights but entitles the holder to   one   vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our certificate of incorporation. 
  NuDevco Retail and Retailco have the right to exchange (the  Exchange Right ) all or a portion of their Spark HoldCo units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock (or cash at Spark Energy, Inc. s or Spark HoldCo s election (the  Cash Option )) at an exchange ratio of   one   share of Class A common stock for each Spark HoldCo unit (and corresponding share of Class B common stock) exchanged. In addition, NuDevco Retail and Retailco have the right, under certain circumstances, to cause the Company to register the offer and resale of NuDevco Retail's and Retailco's shares of Class A common stock obtained pursuant to the Exchange Right. Retail Acquisition Co., LLC ("RAC") is entitled to similar registration rights under the CenStar Note and Oasis Note. Refer to Note   7   "Debt" for further discussion.   
   
  2. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements ( interim statements ) of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

( GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC"), and include all wholly owned subsidiaries. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include all wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. We account for investments over which we have significant influence but not a controlling financial interest using the equity method of accounting. 
  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the interim financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations resulting from revisions to estimates are recognized when the facts that give rise to the revision become known. The information furnished herein reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or for any interim period.  
    
  Transactions with Affiliates 
  The Company also enters into transactions with and pays certain costs on behalf of affiliates that are commonly controlled by W. Keith Maxwell III, and these affiliates enter into transactions with and pay certain costs on our behalf, in order to reduce risk, reduce administrative expense, create economies of scale, create strategic alliances and supply goods and services among these related parties. 
  These transactions include, but are not limited to, employee benefits provided through the Company s benefit plans, insurance plans, leased office space, administrative salaries for management due diligence work, recurring management consulting, and accounting, tax, legal, or technology services based on services provided, departmental usage, or headcount, which are considered reasonable by management. As such, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include costs that have been incurred by the Company and then directly billed or allocated to affiliates, and costs that have been incurred by our affiliates and then directly billed or allocated to us, and are recorded net in general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations with a corresponding accounts receivable affiliates or accounts payable affiliates, respectively, recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company enters into transactions with certain affiliates for sales or purchases of natural gas and electricity, which are recorded in retail revenues, retail cost of revenues and net asset optimization revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations with a corresponding accounts receivable affiliate or accounts payable affiliate in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The allocations and related estimates and assumptions are described more fully in Note   12    Transactions with Affiliates.   
    
  Presentation of the Acquisition of Oasis Power Holdings, LLC  
    
  On May 12, 2015, RAC, an affiliate of the Company, completed the acquisition of   100%   of the membership interests of Oasis. Also, on May 12, 2015, Spark HoldCo entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Oasis Purchase Agreement") with RAC for the purchase of all the membership interests of Oasis. Spark HoldCo completed the acquisition of Oasis from RAC on July 31, 2015. Because the acquisition of Oasis was a transfer of equity interests of entities under common control, the Company's historical financial statements reflect operations of Oasis from May 12, 2015 to July 31, 2015.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for this recast period had been prepared from RAC's historical cost-basis and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred had the Company owned Oasis during the recast period. 
    
  Presentation of the Acquisition of Major Energy Companies 

10 

     Table of Contents  

On April 15, 2016, National Gas   Electric, LLC ( NG E ), an affiliate of the Company  , completed the acquisition of     100%     of the membership interests of Major Energy Companies. On May 3, 2016, Spark HoldCo and Retailco entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Major Purchase Agreement") with NG E for the purchase of all of the membership interests of the Major Energy Companies. Spark HoldCo and Retailco completed the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies from NG E on August 23, 2016. Because the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies was a transfer of equity interests of entities under common control, the Company's historical financial statements have been recast in this Form 10-Q to include the results attributable to Major Energy Companies from April 15, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for this recast period have been prepared from Major Energy Companies' historical cost-basis and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred had the Company owned the Major Energy Companies during the recast period. 
    
  Subsequent Events 
    
  Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date these financial statements are issued. Any material subsequent events that occurred prior to such date have been properly recognized or disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note   14    Subsequent Events  for further discussion. 
    
  Reclassification 
  Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported earnings. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09"),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which deferred the effective date to periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is selecting a transition method and determining the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  The FASB issued additional amendments to ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14: 
             
    March 2016 - ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ("ASU 2016-08"). ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to customers.  
                
    April 2016 - ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ("ASU 2016-10"). ASU 2016-10 covers two specific topics: performance obligations and licensing. This amendment includes guidance on immaterial promised goods or services, shipping or handling activities, separately identifiable performance obligations, functional or symbolic intellectual property licenses, sales-based and usage-based royalties, license restrictions (time, use, geographical) and licensing renewals.  
                
    May 2016 - ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12"). ASU 2016-12 clarifies certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the full retrospective transition method is adopted.

     Table of Contents  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 amends existing guidance to require subsequent measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02")  .   ASU 2016-02 amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting by requiring entities to include substantially all leases on the balance sheet by requiring the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases. Entities may elect to not recognize leases with a maximum possible term of less than 12 months. For lessees, a lease is classified as finance or operating and the asset and liability are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. For lessors, accounting for leases is largely unchanged from previous guidance. ASU 2016-02 also requires qualitative disclosures along with certain specific quantitative disclosures for both lessees and lessors. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and are effective for interim periods in the year of adoption. The ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation     (Topic 718)   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for shared-based payments, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under current U.S. GAAP, excess tax benefits are currently recorded in equity and presented as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Upon adoption, excess tax benefits for share-based payments will be recorded as a reduction of income taxes and reflected in operating cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a current expected credit loss ("CECL") model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The model requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected credit losses during the period. The measurement of expected losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues in the statement of cash flows. Those issues are cash payment for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instrument or other debt instrument with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; cash proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, cash received from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distribution received from equity method investees; beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This ASU should be

applied using a retrospective transition method for each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740):     Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ).  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory.   Current U.S. GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

3. Acquisitions    

Acquisition of the Provider Companies  
    
  On August 1, 2016, the Company and Spark HoldCo completed the purchase of all of the outstanding membership interests of the Provider Companies. The Provider Companies serve electrical customers in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The purchase price for the Provider Companies was approximately   $34.1 million  , which included   $1.3 million   in working capital, subject to adjustments, and up to   $9.0 million   in earnout payments, valued at   $4.8 million   as of the purchase date, to be paid by June 30, 2017, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets (the "Provider Earnout"). See Note   8   "Fair Value Measurements" for further discussion on the Provider Earnout. The purchase price was funded by the issuance of   699,742   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units) sold to Retailco, valued at   $14.0 million   based on a value of   $20   per share; borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility of   $10.6 million  ; and   $3.8 million   in net installment consideration to be paid in   ten   monthly payments that commenced in August 2016. The first payment of   $0.4 million   was made with the initial consideration paid. See Note   7   "Debt" for further discussion of the Senior Credit Facility.  
        
  The acquisition of the Provider Companies has been accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805,   Business Combinations   ( ASC 805 )  .   The allocation of purchase consideration was based upon the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The allocation was made to major categories of assets and liabilities based on management s best estimates, supported by independent third-party analyses. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration is as follows (in thousands): 

13 

     Table of Contents  

The fair values of intangible assets were measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined by ASC 820,   "Fair Value Measurement"   ("ASC 820"). The fair value of derivative liabilities were measured by utilizing readily available quoted market prices and non-exchange-traded contracts fair valued using market price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges and represent a Level 2 measurement as defined by ASC 820. Refer to Note   8   "Fair Value Measurements" for further discussion on the fair values hierarchy. Significant inputs for Level 3 measurements were as follows: 
    
  Customer relationships.   The customer relationships, reflective of the Provider Companies' customer base, were valued using an excess earnings method under the income approach. Using this method, the Company estimated the future cash flows resulting from the existing customer relationships, considering attrition as well as charges for contributory assets, such as net working capital, intangible assets, and assembled workforce. These future cash flows were then discounted using an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return to arrive at the present value of the expected future cash flows. These customer relationships were bifurcated between unhedged and hedged and will be amortized to depreciation and amortization based on the expected future net cash flows by year and expensed to Retail cost of revenues based on the expected term of the underlying fixed price contract acquired in each reporting period, respectively. 
    
  Trademark.   The fair value of the Provider Companies' trademark is reflective of the value associated with the recognition and reputation of the Provider Companies to its target markets. The fair value of the trademark was estimated using the income approach. Under this approach, the Company estimated the expected trademark royalty revenue by analyzing market royalty rates of comparative trademark agreements and applying an expected royalty rate to estimate royalty revenue. Such estimated royalty revenue was then added to the forecast of the Provider Companies' revenue, which was then discounted using an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return.  The trademark is being amortized over the estimated   five  -year life of the asset on a straight-line basis. 
    
  Non-compete agreements.   The non-compete agreements provide the Company with a certain level of assurance that the Provider Companies' expected earnings stream will not be disrupted by competition from Provider Companies' previous members. The fair value of the non-compete agreements was determined using the differential valuation approach. Under this approach, the Company estimated the present value of expected future cash flows under two scenarios; one scenario assumes the non-compete agreements are in place and the other scenario assumes the absence of non-compete agreements. The resulting difference between the two scenarios is the implied value of the non-compete agreements, which was further adjusted by an estimated probability factor representing the likelihood that previous members of the Provider Companies would be successful competitors.                 
    
  Goodwill.   The excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of the amounts initially assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the Provider Companies primarily due the value of its assembled workforce, along with access to new utility service territories. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Provider Companies is deductible for income tax purposes because the Provider Companies was an acquisition of all of the assets of the Provider Companies. The valuation and purchase price allocation of the Provider Companies was based on a preliminary fair value analysis. The Company anticipates adjustments to the working capital amounts that are expected to be finalized prior to the measurement period's expiration.  
    
  The Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, included   $19.6 million   of revenue and   $6.9 million   of losses from operations related to the operations of the Provider Companies.  We have not included pro forma information for the Provider Companies acquisition because it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Acquisition of the Major Energy Companies  
    
  On August 23, 2016, the Company and Spark HoldCo completed the transfer of all of the outstanding membership interests of the Major Energy Companies, which are retail energy companies operating in Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland (including the District of Columbia), Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania across   43   utilities, from NG E in exchange for consideration of   $63.2 million  , which included   $4.3 million   in working capital, subject to adjustments; an assumed litigation reserve of   $5.0 million  , and up to   $35.0 million   in installment and earnout payments, valued at   $13.1 million   as of the purchase date, to be paid to the previous members of the Major Energy Companies, in annual installments on March 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets (the  Major Earnout ).  In addition, the Company is obligated to issue up to   200,000   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units) to NG E, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets, valued at   $0.8 million   (  40,718   shares valued at   $20   per share) as of the purchase date (the "Stock Earnout").  See Note   8    Fair Value Measurements  for further discussion on the Major Earnout and Stock Earnout. The purchase price was funded by the issuance of   2,000,000   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units) valued at   $40.0 million   based on a value of   $20   per share, to NG E. NG E is owned by W. Keith Maxwell, III, our Chairman of the Board, founder and majority shareholder.   
  The acquisition of the Major Energy Companies by the Company and Spark HoldCo from NG E was a transfer of equity interests of entities under common control on August 23, 2016.  Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on their historical values as of August 23, 2016.  NG E acquired the Major Energy Companies on April 15, 2016 and the fair value of the net assets acquired were as follows (in thousands): 

The initial working capital estimate paid to the Major Energy Companies by NG E was   $10.3 million  .  The Company subsequently paid   $4.3 million   in working capital to NG E.  Approximately   $6.0 million   was recorded as an equity transaction and treated as a contribution. 
  Goodwill was transferred based on the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies by NG E on April 15, 2016 and was primarily due to the Major Energy Companies brand strength, established vendor relationships and access to new utility service territories. Goodwill recorded in connection with the transfer of the Major Energy Companies is deductible for income tax purposes.  
  The Major Energy Companies contributed revenues of   $47.6 million   and earnings of   $5.2 million   to the Company for the three month period ending September 30, 2016; and contributed revenues of   $80.8 million   and earnings of   $5.6 million   to the Company for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.  
  The following unaudited pro forma revenue and earnings summary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 (in thousands):

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the companies operated on a combined basis during the periods presented. The revenue and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflects actual results of operations since the financial results were fully combined during that period. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to amortization of acquired intangibles, and certain accounting policy alignments as well as direct and incremental acquisition related costs reflected in the historical financial statements. The preliminary purchase price allocation was used to prepare the pro forma adjustments. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the pro forma adjustments. 

4. Equity    
    
  Non-controlling Interest 
    
  The Company holds an economic interest and is the sole managing member in Spark HoldCo, with NuDevco Retail and Retailco holding the remaining economic interest in Spark HoldCo. As a result, the Company has consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Spark HoldCo and reflected the economic interest retained by NuDevco Retail and Retailco as a non-controlling interest. 
    
  From January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , the Company and NuDevco Retail and Retailco owned the following economic interests in Spark HoldCo:

HoldCo unit (and corresponding share of Class B common stock) exchanged. Refer to Note   10   "Taxes" for further discussion. 
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of Class A common shares outstanding for the period (the denominator). Class B common shares are not included in the calculation of basic earnings per share because they are not participating securities and have no economic interest in the Company. Diluted earnings per share is similarly calculated except that the denominator is increased (1) using the treasury stock method to determine the potential dilutive effect of the Company's outstanding unvested restricted stock units, (2) using the if-converted method to determine the potential dilutive effect of the Company's Class B common stock and (3) using the if-converted method to determine the potential dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes into the Company's Class B common stock.  
    
  The following table presents the computation of earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data):  

The conversion of shares of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock was not recognized in dilutive earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the effect of the conversion was antidilutive.

Variable Interest Entity 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation     (Topic 810)   ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Upon adoption, we continued to consolidate Spark HoldCo, but considered Spark HoldCo to be a variable interest entity requiring additional disclosures in the footnotes of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Spark HoldCo is a variable interest entity due to its lack of rights to participate in significant financial and operating decisions and inability to dissolve or otherwise remove its management. Spark HoldCo owns all of the outstanding membership interests in each of the operating subsidiaries through which the Company operates. The Company is the sole managing member of Spark HoldCo, manages Spark HoldCo's operating subsidiaries through this managing membership interest, and is considered the primary beneficiary of Spark HoldCo.  
    
  The assets of Spark HoldCo cannot be used to settle the obligations of the Company except through distributions to the Company, and the liabilities of Spark HoldCo cannot be settled by the Company except through contributions to Spark HoldCo. 
    
  The following table includes the carrying amounts and classification of the assets and liabilities of Spark HoldCo that are included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

     Senior Credit Facility 
    
  The Company, as guarantor, and Spark HoldCo (the  Borrower,  and together with SE, SEG, CenStar, CenStar Operating Company, LLC, Oasis, Oasis Power, LLC, Electricity Maine, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC, and Provider Power Mass, LLC, each a subsidiary of Spark HoldCo, the  Co-Borrowers ) are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility ( Senior Credit Facility ), which includes a senior secured revolving working capital facility up to   $82.5 million   ("Working Capital Line") and a secured revolving line of credit of   $25.0 million   ("Acquisition Line") to be used specifically for the financing of up to   75%   of the cost of acquisitions with the remainder to be financed by the Company either through cash on hand or the issuance of subordinated debt or equity.  On September 30, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers elected to reduce the capacity of the Working Capital Line from   $82.5 million   to   $60.0 million  .  The Senior Credit Facility will mature on July 8, 2017 and may be extended for   one   additional year with lender consent. Borrowings under the Acquisition Line will be repaid   25%   per year with the remainder due at maturity. 
    
  On June 1, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Senior Credit Facility to, among other things, increase the Working Capital Line from   $60.0 million   to   $82.5 million   in accordance with the Co-Borrowers' right to increase under the existing terms of the Senior Credit Facility. Amendment No. 3 also provides for the addition of new lenders and re-allocates working capital and revolving commitments among existing and new lenders. Amendment No. 3 also provides for additional representations of the Co-Borrowers and additional protections of the lenders of the Senior Credit Facility. 
    
  On August 1, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Credit Facility to, among other things, amend the provisions under the Acquisition Line to allow for the Provider Companies acquisition. Amendment No. 4 also raises the minimum availability under the Working Capital Line to   $40.0 million  . In addition, Amendment No. 4 designates Major Energy Companies as "unrestricted subsidiaries" upon the closing of such acquisition on August 23, 2016. Refer to Note   3   "Acquisitions" for further discussion. 
    
  At our election, the interest rate under the Working Capital Line is generally determined by reference to: 
             
    the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to   3.00%   per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization); or 
     
   22 

     Table of Contents  

the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of up to   2.00%   per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). The alternate base rate is equal to the highest of (i) Soci t  G n rale s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   per annum, or (iii) the reference Eurodollar rate plus   1.00%  ; or 
                
    the rate quoted by Soci t  G n rale as its cost of funds for the requested credit plus up to   2.50%   per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). 
       
  The interest rate is generally reduced by   25 basis points   if utilization under the Working Capital Line is below fifty percent.  
  Borrowings under the Acquisition Line are generally determined by reference to: 

the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to   3.75%   per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization); or 
                
    the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of up to   2.75%   per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). The alternate base rate is equal to the highest of (i) Soci t  G n rale's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   per annum, or (iii) the reference Eurodollar rate plus   1.00%  . 
       
  The Co-Borrowers pay an annual commitment fee of   0.375%   or   0.5%   on the unused portion of the Working Capital Line depending upon the unused capacity and   0.5%   on the unused portion of the Acquisition Line. The lending syndicate under the Senior Credit Facility is entitled to several additional fees including an upfront fee, annual agency fee, and fronting fees based on a percentage of the face amount of letters of credit payable to any syndicate member that issues a letter a credit.  
    
  The Company has the ability to elect the availability under the Working Capital Line between   $40.0 million   to   $82.5 million  .  On September 30, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers elected to reduce the capacity of the Working Capital Line from   $82.5 million   to   $60.0 million  .  Availability under the working capital line will be subject to borrowing base limitations. The borrowing base is calculated primarily based on   80%   to   90%   of the value of eligible accounts receivable and unbilled product sales (depending on the credit quality of the counterparties) and inventory and other working capital assets. The Co-Borrowers must generally seek approval of the agent or the lenders for permitted acquisitions to be financed under the Acquisition Line. 
    
  The Senior Credit Facility is secured by pledges of the equity of the portion of Spark HoldCo owned by the Company and of the equity of Spark HoldCo s subsidiaries and the Co-Borrowers  present and future subsidiaries, all of the Co-Borrowers  and their subsidiaries  present and future property and assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and liquid investments, and control agreements relating to bank accounts. The Senior Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of specified ratios or conditions as follows: 

Minimum Net Working Capital  . The Co-Borrowers must maintain minimum consolidated net working capital through December 30, 2016 equal to the greater of   $5.0 million   or   10%  , and from December 31, 2016 and thereafter equal to the greater of   $5.0 million   or   15%   of the elected availability under the Working Capital Line. 

Minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth.   Spark Energy, Inc. must maintain a minimum consolidated adjusted tangible net worth at all times equal to the net cash proceeds from equity issuances occurring after the date of the Senior Credit Facility plus the greater of (i)   20%   of aggregate commitments under the Working Capital Line plus   33%   of borrowings under the Acquisition Line and (ii)   $18.0 million  . 

Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.   Spark Energy, Inc. must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.10   to 1.00 (with quarterly increases to the numerator of increments of   0.05   up to a maximum of   1.25  ). The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) the sum of consolidated interest expense (other than interest paid-in-kind in respect of any Subordinated Debt), letter of credit fees, commitment fees, acquisition earn-out payments, distributions and scheduled amortization payments.

     Table of Contents  

Maximum Total Leverage Ratio.   Spark Energy, Inc. must maintain a ratio of total indebtedness (excluding the Working Capital Facility and qualifying subordinated debt) to Adjusted EBITDA of a maximum of   2.50   to 1.00.  
       
  The Senior Credit Facility contains various negative covenants that limit the Company s ability to, among other things, do any of the following: 

incur certain additional indebtedness; 
                
    grant certain liens; 
                
    engage in certain asset dispositions; 
                
    merge or consolidate; 
                
    make certain payments, distributions, investments, acquisitions or loans; or 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates. 
       
  Spark Energy, Inc. is entitled to pay cash dividends to the holders of the Class A common stock and Spark HoldCo will be entitled to make cash distributions to NuDevco Retail and Retailco (or their successors in interest) so long as: (a) no default exists or would result from such a payment; (b) the Co-Borrowers are in pro forma compliance with all financial covenants before and after giving effect to such payment and (c) the outstanding amount of all loans and letters of credit does not exceed the borrowing base limits. Spark HoldCo s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants or the existence of an event of default, if not cured or waived, under the Senior Credit Facility could prevent the Company from paying dividends to holders of the Class A common stock. 
    
  The Senior Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties and events of default. Events of default include, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults and cross-acceleration to certain indebtedness, change in control in which affiliates of W. Keith Maxwell III own less than   40%   of the outstanding voting interests in the Company, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, material judgments in excess of   $5.0 million  , certain events with respect to material contracts, actual or asserted failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the Senior Credit Facility to be in full force and effect and changes of control. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.  
    
  In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type. The covenants include delivery of financial statements (including any filings made with the SEC, maintenance of property and insurance, payment of taxes and obligations, material compliance with laws, inspection of property, books and records and audits, use of proceeds, payments to bank blocked accounts, notice of defaults and certain   other customary matters. 
    
  Convertible Subordinated Notes to Affiliate 
    
  In connection with the financing of the CenStar acquisition, the Company, together with Spark HoldCo, issued the CenStar Note to RAC for   $2.1 million   on July 8, 2015. The CenStar Note matures on July 8, 2020, and bears interest at an annual rate of   5%  , payable semiannually. The Company has the right to pay interest in kind at its option. The CenStar Note is convertible into shares of the Company s Class B common stock, par value   $0.01   per share (and a related unit of Spark HoldCo) at a conversion price of   $16.57   per share. RAC may not exercise conversion rights for the first   eighteen   months after the CenStar Note is issued. The CenStar Note is subject to automatic conversion upon a sale of the Company. The CenStar Note is subordinated in certain respects to the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a subordination agreement. The Company may pay interest and prepay principal so long as the Company is in compliance with its covenants; is not in default under the Senior Credit Facility and has minimum availability of   $5.0 million   under its borrowing base under the Senior Credit Facility. Shares of Class A common stock resulting from the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock issued as a result of the conversion right under the CenStar Note will be entitled to registration rights identical to the registration rights currently held by NuDevco Retail and Retailco on shares of Class A common stock it receives upon conversion of

     Table of Contents  

its existing shares of Class B common stock.  On October 5, 2016, RAC issued to the Company an irrevocable commitment to convert the CenStar Note into   134,731   shares of Class B common stock (and related Spark HoldCo units) on January 8, 2017.  Please see Note 14 "Subsequent Events." 
    
  In connection with the financing of the Oasis acquisition, the Company, together with Spark HoldCo, issued the Oasis Note to RAC for   $5.0 million   on July 31, 2015. The Oasis Note matures on July 31, 2020, and bears interest at an annual rate of   5%  , payable semiannually. The Company has the right to pay-in-kind any interest at its option. The Oasis Note is convertible into shares of the Company's Class B common stock, par value   $0.01   per share (and a related unit of Spark HoldCo) at a conversion price of   $14.00   per share. RAC may not exercise conversion rights for the first   eighteen   months after the Oasis Note is issued. The Oasis Note is subject to automatic conversion upon a sale of the Company. The Oasis Note is subordinated in certain respects to the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a subordination agreement. The Company may pay interest and prepay principal so long as the Company is in compliance with its covenants; is not in default under the Senior Credit Facility and has minimum availability of   $5.0 million   under its borrowing base under the Senior Credit Facility. Shares of Class A common stock resulting from the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock issued as a result of the conversion right under the Oasis Note will be entitled to registration rights identical to the registration rights currently held by NuDevco Retail and Retailco on shares of Class A common stock it receives upon conversion of its existing shares of Class B common stock.  On October 5, 2016, RAC issued to the Company an irrevocable commitment to convert the Oasis Note into   383,090   shares of Class B common stock (and related Spark HoldCo units) on January 31, 2017.  Please see Note 14 "Subsequent Events." 
    
  The conversion rate of   $14.00   per share for the Oasis Note was fixed as of the date of the execution of the Oasis acquisition agreement on May 12, 2015. Due to a rise in the price of our common stock from May 12, 2015 to the closing of Oasis acquisition on July 31, 2015, the conversion rate of   $14.00   per share was below the market price per share of Class A common stock of   $16.21   on the issuance date of the Oasis Note on July 31, 2015. As a result, the Company assessed the Oasis Note for a beneficial conversion feature. Due to this conversion feature being "in-the-money" upon issuance, we recognized a beneficial conversion feature based on its intrinsic value of   $0.8 million   as a discount to the Oasis Note and as additional paid-in capital. This discount will be amortized as interest expense under the effective interest method over the life of the Oasis Note. 
    
  Pacific Summit Energy LLC 
  The Major Energy Companies acquired by the Company are party to   three   trade credit arrangements with Pacific Summit Energy LLC ( Pacific Summit ), which consist of purchase agreements, operating agreements relating to purchasing terms, security agreements, lockbox agreements and guarantees, providing for the exclusive supply of gas and electricity on credit by Pacific Summit to the Major Energy Companies for resale to end users.  
  Under these arrangements, when the costs that Pacific Summit has paid to procure and deliver the gas and electricity exceed the payments that the Major Energy Companies have made attributable to the gas and electricity purchased, the Major Energy Companies incur interest on the difference. The operating agreements also allow Pacific Summit to provide credit support. Each form of borrowing incurs interest at the floating 90-day LIBOR rate plus   300   basis points (except for certain credit support guaranties that do not bear interest). In connection with these arrangements, the Major Companies have granted first liens to Pacific Summit on a substantial portion of the Major Companies  assets, including present and future accounts receivable, inventory, liquid assets, and control agreements relating to bank accounts.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had aggregate outstanding amounts payable under these arrangements of approximately   $13.4 million  , bearing an interest rate of approximately   3.9%  . The Company was also the beneficiary under various credit support guarantees issued by Pacific Summit under these arrangements as of such date. On September 27, 2016, we notified Pacific Summit of our election to trigger the expiration of these arrangements as of March 31, 2017, at the end of the primary term.   
   
  8. Fair Value Measurement    
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of the Company s own nonperformance risk on its liabilities. 
  The Company applies fair value measurements to its commodity derivative instruments and a contingent payment arrangement based on the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivative instruments. 
                
    Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices recorded in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity forwards and swaps and options. 
                
    Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, observable market activity for the asset or liability. The Level 3 category includes estimated earnout obligations related to the Company's acquisitions.  
     As the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3), the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following table presents assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis by and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of (in thousands):    

26 

     Table of Contents  

The Company had no transfers of assets or liabilities between any of the above levels during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company s derivative contracts include exchange-traded contracts fair valued utilizing readily available quoted market prices and non-exchange-traded contracts fair valued using market price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges. In addition, in determining the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts, the Company applies a credit risk valuation adjustment to reflect credit risk that is calculated based on the Company s or the counterparty s historical credit risks. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the credit risk valuation adjustment was not material. 
  The contingent payment arrangements referred to above reflect estimated earnout obligations incurred in relation to the Company's acquisitions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated earnout obligations were   $18.9 million  , which was comprised of the Provider Earnout, the Major Earnout and the Stock Earnout in the amount of   $4.8 million  ,   $13.3 million  , and   $0.8 million  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2015  , the estimated earnout obligations were attributed to the CenStar acquisition (the "CenStar Earnout") in the amount of   $0.5 million  , which was settled by September 30, 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated earnouts reside on our condensed consolidated balance sheets in current liabilities - contingent consideration and long-term liabilities - contingent consideration in the amount of   $11.3 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively; and as of   December 31, 2015  , in current liabilities - contingent consideration in the amount of   $0.5 million  . 
  The CenStar Earnout was based on a financial measurement attributable to the operations of CenStar for the year following the closing of the acquisition. In determining the fair value of the CenStar Earnout, the Company forecasted a   one   year performance measurement, as defined by the CenStar stock purchase agreement. As this calculation was based on management's estimates of the liability, we classified the CenStar Earnout as a Level 3 measurement. During the first quarter of 2016, our estimate of the CenStar Earnout was increased to   $1.5 million   which was based on the results of operations during such period. In August 2016, we entered into a settlement and release agreement with the seller of CenStar in which the Company paid   $1.3 million   to such seller and released an additional   $0.6 million   from escrow in full satisfaction of the earnout obligation under the CenStar stock purchase agreement. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the residual earnout amount of   $0.2 million   was written off via a reduction to general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The Provider Earnout is based on achievement by the Provider Companies of a certain customer count criteria over the   nine   month period following the closing of the Provider Companies acquisition. The sellers of the Provider Companies are entitled to a maximum of   $9.0 million   and a minimum of   $5.0 million   in earnout payments based on the level of customer count attained, as defined by the Provider Companies membership interest purchase agreement. In determining the fair value of the Provider Earnout, the Company forecasted an expected customer count and certain other related criteria and calculated the probability of such forecast being attained. As this calculation is based on management's estimates of the liability, we classified the Provider Earnout as a Level 3 measurement.  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

The Major Earnout is based on the achievement by the Major Energy Companies of certain performance targets over the   33   month period following NG E's closing of the Major Energy Companies acquisition (i.e., April 15, 2016). The previous members of Major Energy Companies are entitled to a maximum of   $20.0 million   in earnout payments based on the level of performance targets attained, as defined by the Major Purchase Agreement. The Stock Earnout obligation is contingent upon the Major Energy Companies achieving the Major Earnout's performance target ceiling, thereby earning the maximum Major Earnout payments. If the Major Energy Companies earn such maximum Major Earnout payments, NG E would be entitled to a maximum of   200,000   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units). In determining the fair value of the Major Earnout and the Stock Earnout, the Company forecasted certain expected performance targets and calculated the probability of such forecast being attained. As this calculation is based on management's estimates of the liability, we classified the Major Earnout as a Level 3 measurement.  
  Other Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts receivable affiliates, accounts payable, accounts payable affiliates, and accrued liabilities recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the Senior Credit Facility recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value because of the variable rate nature of the Company s line of credit. The fair value of our convertible subordinated notes to affiliates is not determinable for accounting purposes due to the affiliate nature and terms of the associated debt instrument with the affiliate. The fair value of the payable pursuant to tax receivable agreement affiliate is not determinable for accounting purposes due to the affiliate nature and terms of the associated agreement with the affiliate. 
   
  9. Accounting for Derivative Instruments    
  The Company is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas and basis costs, storage and ancillary capacity charges from independent system operators. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to these risks. 
  The Company holds certain derivative instruments that are not held for trading purposes and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These derivative instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate the Company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. For these derivative instruments, changes in the fair value are recognized currently in earnings in retail revenues or retail cost of revenues. 
  As part of the Company s strategy to optimize its assets and manage related risks, it also manages a portfolio of commodity derivative instruments held for trading purposes. The Company s commodity trading activities are subject to limits within the Company s Risk Management Policy. For these derivative instruments, changes in the fair value are recognized currently in earnings in net asset optimization revenues. 
  Derivative assets and liabilities are presented net in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets when the derivative instruments are executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. The Company s derivative contracts include transactions that are executed both on an exchange and centrally cleared as well as over-the-counter, bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. To the extent the Company has paid or received collateral related to the derivative assets or liabilities, such amounts would be presented net against the related derivative asset or liability s fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1.2 million   and   $0.1 million   in collateral outstanding, respectively. The specific types of derivative instruments the Company may execute to manage the commodity price risk include the following: 

Forward contracts, which commit the Company to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future; 
                
    Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument; 
                
    Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined notional quantity; and 
     
   28 

     Table of Contents  

Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity. 
     The Company has entered into other energy-related contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualify for the normal purchase or normal sale exception and are therefore not accounted for at fair value including the following: 
    
     Forward electricity and natural gas purchase contracts for retail customer load, and 
     Natural gas transportation contracts and storage agreements.

              (2)  
    Excludes settlements of   $11.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   related to non-trading derivative liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and Major Energy Companies.

    Excludes settlements of   $0.6 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to non-trading derivative liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of CenStar and Oasis. 
              (2)  
    Excludes settlements of    $14.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    related to non-trading derivative liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and Major Energy Companies.

10. Taxes    
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company and CenStar are each subject to U.S. federal income tax as a corporation. Spark HoldCo and its subsidiaries, with the exception of CenStar, are treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and, as such, are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to their taxable income is passed through to their members or partners. Accordingly, the Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its allocable share of Spark HoldCo s net U.S. taxable income. 
    
  The Company accounts for income taxes using the assets and liabilities method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and those assets and liabilities tax bases. The Company applies existing tax law and the tax rate that the Company expects to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled in calculating the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period of the tax rate enactment.    
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17") that is intended to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that all deferred taxes be classified as noncurrent and presented as a single noncurrent amount for each tax-payment component of an entity. The ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, the Company elected early adoption on January 1, 2016, on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in the reclassification of previously-classified net current deferred taxes of approximately   $0.9 million   from other current liabilities, resulting in a   $23.4 million   noncurrent deferred tax asset and a   $0.9 million   noncurrent deferred tax liability on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. There was no impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. The Company considers, among other things, its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends, and its outlook for future years. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized.    
    
  On February 3, 2016, Retailco exchanged   1,000,000   of its Spark HoldCo units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock. The exchange resulted in a step up in tax basis, which gave rise to a deferred tax asset of approximately   $8.0 million   on the exchange date. In addition, the Company recorded an additional long-term liability as a result of the exchange of approximately   $10.3 million   pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement and a corresponding long-term deferred tax asset of approximately   $3.9 million  . The initial estimate for the deferred tax asset, net of the liability, under the Tax Receivable Agreement was recorded within additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On April 1, 2016, Retailco exchanged   1,725,000   of its Spark HoldCo units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock. The exchange resulted in a step up in tax basis, which gave rise to a deferred tax asset of approximately   $7.6 million   on the exchange date. In addition, the Company recorded an additional long-term liability as a result of the exchange of approximately   $10.3 million   pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement and a corresponding long-term deferred tax asset of approximately   $3.9 million  . The initial estimate for the deferred tax asset, net of the liability, under the Tax Receivable Agreement was recorded within additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  .

On June 8, 2016, Retailco exchanged   500,000   of its Spark HoldCo units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock. The exchange resulted in a step up in tax basis, which gave rise to a deferred tax asset of approximately   $5.3 million   on the exchange date. In addition, the Company recorded an additional long-term liability as a result of the exchange of approximately   $6.9 million   pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement and a corresponding long-term deferred tax asset of approximately   $2.6 million  . The initial estimate for the deferred tax asset, net of the liability, under the Tax Receivable Agreement was recorded within additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately   $15.6 million   related to the step up in tax basis resulting from the purchase by the Company of Spark HoldCo units from NuDevco Retail and NuDevco Retail Holdings (predecessor to Retailco) on the IPO date. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total liability of   $50.6 million   for the effect of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability classified as a long-term liability. The Company had a long-term deferred tax asset of approximately   $20.0 million   related to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability. See Note 12  Transactions with Affiliates  for further discussion. 
    
  The effective U.S. federal and state income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is   14.2%   and   6.5%  , respectively, with respect to pre-tax income attributable to the Company's stockholders. The higher effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily attributable to the CenStar acquisition, discrete items and a decrease in the non-controlling interest. The discrete items were related to federal tax rate increase that is driven by the additional taxable income from the two acquistions, Provider Companies and Major Energy Companies. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to units exchanged by Retailco, which corresponds with an increase in taxable income allocable to the Company from Spark HoldCo that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation.  
    
  Total income tax expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income primarily due to state taxes and the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income, most notably the income attributable to non-controlling interest. The effective tax rate includes a rate benefit attributable to the fact that Spark HoldCo operates as a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and is not subject to federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, the portion of earnings attributable to non-controlling interest is subject to tax when reported as a component of the non-controlling interest s taxable income. The February, April and June 2016 exchanges by Retailco decreased the effective tax rate benefit attributable to non-controlling interest. 

11. Commitment and Contingencies    
  From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal, tax, regulatory and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Other than proceedings discussed below, management does not believe that we are a party to any litigation, claims or proceedings that will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigations or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
    
  Indirect Tax Audits 
    
  The Company is undergoing various types of indirect tax audits spanning from years 2006 to 2016 for which the Company may have additional liabilities arise. At the time of filing these condensed consolidated financial statements, these indirect tax audits are at an early stage and subject to substantial uncertainties concerning the outcome of audit findings and corresponding responses. We accrued   $1.6 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which increased accrued liabilities for these indirect tax audits to reflect our best estimate of the amounts we believe we will owe to   $1.9 million   at September 30, 2016. The outcome of these indirect tax audits may result in additional expense.

Legal Proceedings  
    
  The Company is the subject of the following lawsuits: 
    
  John Melville et al v. Spark Energy Inc. and Spark Energy Gas, LLC   is a purported class action filed on December 17, 2015 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging, among other things, that (i) sales representatives engaged as independent contractors for Spark Energy Gas, LLC engaged in deceptive acts in violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and (ii) Spark Energy Gas, LLC  breached its contract with plaintiff, including a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for himself and the purported class, injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief, disgorgement of revenues and/or profits and attorneys  fees. On March 14, 2016, Spark Energy Gas, LLC and Spark Energy, Inc. filed a Motion to Dismiss this case. On April 18, 2016, Plaintiff filed his Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. On April 25, 2016, Spark Energy, Inc. and Spark Energy Gas, LLC filed a Reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss. The Motion to Dismiss was set on the Court's submission docket for May 2, 2016. The parties are currently waiting on the Court s ruling. Discovery has not yet commenced in this matter. We cannot predict the outcome or consequences of this case. 
    
  Halifax-American Energy Company, LLC et al v. Provider Power, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC, Electricity Maine, LLC, Emile Clavet and Kevin Dean   is a lawsuit initially filed on June 12, 2014 in the Rockingham County Superior Court, State of New Hampshire, alleging various claims related to the Provider Companies  employment of a sales contractor formerly employed with one or more of the plaintiffs, including misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference with a contractual relationship.  The dispute occurred prior to the Company's acquisition of the Provider Companies. Portions of the original claim proceeded to trial and on January 19, 2016, a jury found in favor of the plaintiff. Damages totaling approximately   $0.6 million   and attorney s fees totaling approximately   $0.3 million   were awarded to the plaintiff. On May 4, 2016, following post-verdict motions, the defendants filed an appeal in the State of New Hampshire Supreme Court, appealing, among other things the failure of the trial court to direct a verdict for the defendants, to set aside the verdict, or grant judgment for the defendants, and the trial court's award of certain attorneys' fees.  On August 1, 2016, in connection with the Company s closing of the acquisition of the Provider Companies, the Provider Companies entered into a joint defense agreement with the remaining defendants. The Provider Companies have posted an appeal bond of   $1.0 million   in connection with the appeal.  On November 2, 2016, a briefing order was distributed by the court.  The Provider Companies must have their appellate brief on file with the court no later than December 16, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued approximately   $1.0 million   in contingent liabilities related to this litigation. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this case, however initial damages and attorney's fees have been factored into the purchase price for the Provider Companies and the Company has full indemnity coverage and set-off rights against future price installments for any actual exposure in the appeal.   
    
  In May 2015, the Major Energy Companies settled with the Illinois Commerce Commission with respect to allegations of misleading marketing practices, for   $0.3 million  .  The amount was formerly accounted for in the condensed combined balance sheet of the Major Energy Companies at December 31, 2015. 
    
  In February 2016, the Major Energy Companies settled several claims with respect to allegations of misleading marketing practices with the Maryland Public Service Commission for   $0.3 million  . The   $0.3 million   is included in accrued expenses in the condensed combined balance sheet of the Major Energy Companies at December 31, 2015 and was paid in April 2016. Prospectively, the Commission requires the Major Energy Companies to report monthly to the Maryland Public Service Commission on number of customer complaints. The settlement of   $0.3 million   was paid from a reserve for litigation claims established in connection with the Company s acquisition of the Major Energy Companies, which operates as a reduction to the total purchase price. 
    
  In August 2016, the Major Energy Companies settled with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission/Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement with respect to allegations of misleading marketing practices, for   $4.1 million  . The settlement includes quarterly reporting on number of complaints, as well as allowing for only fixed-rate products to be sold. The settlement was paid in August 2016 after the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies. The amount

  Cost Allocations 
    
  The Company paid certain expenses on behalf of affiliates, which are reimbursed by the affiliates to the Company, and our affiliates paid certain expenses on our behalf, which are reimbursed by us. These transactions include costs that can be specifically identified and certain allocated overhead costs associated with general and administrative services, including executive management, due diligence work, recurring management consulting, facilities, banking arrangements, professional fees, insurance, information services, human resources and other support departments to or from the affiliates. Where costs incurred on behalf of the affiliate or us could not be determined by specific identification for direct billing, the costs were primarily allocated to the affiliated entities or us based on percentage of departmental usage, wages or headcount.  
    
  The total net amount direct billed and allocated from affiliates was   $3.2 million   and   $12.8 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Of this total net amount, the Company recorded general and administrative expense of   $2.9 million   and   $11.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in connection with fees paid, net of damages charged, under the Master Service Agreement with Retailco Services.

Proceeds from Disgorgement of Stockholder Short-swing Profits 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, from Retailco for the disgorgement of stockholder short-swing profits under Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. The amount was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Class B Common Stock 
    
  In connection with the Major Energy Companies acquisition, the Company issued Retailco   2,000,000   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units) to NG E.  In connection with the financing of the Provider Companies acquisition, the Company sold   699,742   shares of Class B common stock (and a corresponding number of Spark HoldCo units) sold to RetailCo, valued at   $14.0 million   based on a value of   $20   per share.  See further discussion in Note 3. 
    
  Tax Receivable Agreement 
    
  The Company is party to a Tax Receivable Agreement with Spark HoldCo, NuDevco Retail Holdings and NuDevco Retail. This agreement generally provides for the payment by the Company to Retailco, LLC (as successor to NuDevco Retail Holdings) and NuDevco Retail of   85%   of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in future periods as a result of (i) any tax basis increases resulting from the purchase by the Company of Spark HoldCo units from NuDevco Retail Holdings, (ii) any tax basis increases resulting from the exchange of Spark HoldCo units for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Right (or resulting from an exchange of Spark HoldCo units for cash pursuant to the Cash Option) and (iii) any imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments the Company makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company retains the benefit of the remaining   15%   of these tax savings. See Note   10    Taxes  for further discussion. 
    
  In certain circumstances, the Company may defer or partially defer any payment due (a  TRA Payment ) to the holders of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which are currently Retailco and NuDevco Retail.  During the   five  -year period ending September 30, 2019, the Company will defer all or a portion of any TRA Payment owed pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent that Spark HoldCo does not generate sufficient Cash Available for Distribution (as defined below) during the four-quarter period ending September 30th of the applicable year in which the TRA Payment is to be made in an amount that equals or exceeds   130%   (the  TRA Coverage Ratio ) of the Total Distributions (as defined below) paid in such four-quarter period by Spark HoldCo. For purposes of computing the TRA Coverage Ratio: 

Cash Available for Distribution  is generally defined as the Adjusted EBITDA of Spark HoldCo for the applicable period, less (i) cash interest paid by Spark HoldCo, (ii) capital expenditures of Spark HoldCo (exclusive of customer acquisition costs) and (iii) any taxes payable by Spark HoldCo; and 
                
     Total Distributions  are defined as the aggregate distributions necessary to cause the Company to receive distributions of cash equal to (i) the targeted quarterly distribution the Company intends to pay to holders of its Class A common stock payable during the applicable four-quarter period, plus (ii) the estimated taxes payable by the Company during such four-quarter period, plus (iii) the expected TRA Payment payable during the calendar year for which the TRA Coverage Ratio is being tested. 
       
  In the event that the TRA Coverage Ratio is not satisfied in any calendar year, the Company will defer all or a portion of the TRA Payment to NuDevco Retail or Retailco under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent necessary to permit Spark HoldCo to satisfy the TRA Coverage Ratio (and Spark HoldCo is not required to make and will not make the pro rata distributions to its members with respect to the deferred portion of the TRA Payment). If the TRA Coverage Ratio is satisfied in any calendar year, the Company is obligated to pay NuDevco Retail or Retailco the full amount of the TRA Payment. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Following the   five  -year deferral period ending September 30, 2019, the Company will be obligated to pay any outstanding deferred TRA Payments to the extent such deferred TRA Payments do not exceed (i) the lesser of the Company's proportionate share of aggregate Cash Available for Distribution of Spark HoldCo during the   five  -year deferral period or the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the   five  -year deferral period, reduced by (ii) the sum of (a) the aggregate target quarterly dividends (which, for the purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, will be   $0.3625   per share per quarter) during the   five  -year deferral period, (b) the Company's estimated taxes during the   five  -year deferral period, and (c) all prior TRA Payments and (y) if with respect to the quarterly period during which the deferred TRA Payment is otherwise paid or payable, Spark HoldCo has or reasonably determines it will have amounts necessary to cause the Company to receive distributions of cash equal to the target quarterly distribution payable during that quarterly period. Any portion of the deferred TRA Payments not payable due to these limitations will no longer be payable. 
    
  We met the threshold coverage ratio required to fund the first TRA Payment to Retailco and NuDevco Retail under the Tax Receivable Agreement during the four-quarter period ending September 30, 2016, resulting in an initial TRA Payment of   $1.4 million   becoming due in December 2016. On November 6, 2016, Retailco and NuDevco Retail granted the Company the right to defer the TRA Payment until May 2018. During the period of time when the Company has elected to defer the TRA Payment, the outstanding payment amount will accrue interest at a rate calculated in the manner provided for under the Tax Receivable Agreement.  The liability has been classified as non-current in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  See also Note 14 "Subsequent Events." 

13. Segment Reporting    
  The Company s determination of reportable business segments considers the strategic operating units under which the Company makes financial decisions, allocates resources and assesses performance of its retail and asset optimization businesses. 
  The Company s reportable business segments are retail natural gas and retail electricity. The retail natural gas segment consists of natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for, residential and commercial customers. Asset optimization activities, considered an integral part of securing the lowest price natural gas to serve retail gas load, are part of the retail natural gas segment. The Company recorded asset optimization revenues of   $26.0 million   and   $27.7 million   and asset optimization cost of revenues of   $25.9 million   and   $28.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which are presented on a net basis in asset optimization revenues. The Company recorded asset optimization revenues of   $89.1 million   and   $120.7 million   and asset optimization cost of revenues of   $89.1 million   and   $119.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which are presented on a net basis in asset optimization revenues. The retail electricity segment consists of electricity sales and transmission to residential and commercial customers. Corporate and other consists of expenses and assets of the retail natural gas and retail electricity segments that are managed at a consolidated level such as general and administrative expenses. 
  To assess the performance of the Company s operating segments, the Chief Operating Decision Maker analyzes retail gross margin. The Company defines retail gross margin as operating income plus (i) depreciation and amortization expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses, less (i) net asset optimization revenues (expenses), (ii) net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments. The Company deducts net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the retail gross margin calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments. 
  Retail gross margin is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non-cash income (loss) impact of our economic hedging activities. As an indicator of our retail energy business

operating performance, retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.  
  Below is a reconciliation of retail gross margin to income before income tax expense (in thousands): 

The Company uses retail gross margin and net asset optimization revenues as the measure of profit or loss for its business segments. This measure represents the lowest level of information that is provided to the chief operating decision maker for our reportable segments.

Declaration of Dividends 
    
  On   October 27, 2016  , the Company declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.3625   to holders of record of our Class A common stock on   December 1, 2016   and payable on   December 14, 2016  .   
    
  TRA Payment Deferral 
    
  On November 6, 2016, Retailco and NuDevco Retail waived their right to receive an approximate   $1.4 million   payment for the Tax Receivable Agreement that was due from the Company on December 15, 2016. The Company has been given the right to defer this payment for up to   eighteen   months, subject to interest at the rate agreed to in the Tax Receivable Agreement.  The liability has been classified as non-current as of September 30, 2016.

  Overview 
    
  Spark Energy, Inc. ("Spark Energy," "Company," "we" or "us") is a growing independent retail energy services company founded in 1999 that provides residential and commercial customers in competitive markets across the United States with an alternative choice for their natural gas and electricity. We purchase our natural gas and electricity supply from a variety of wholesale providers and bill our customers monthly for the delivery of natural gas and electricity based on their consumption at either a fixed or variable price. Natural gas and electricity are then distributed to our customers by local regulated utility companies through their existing infrastructure. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated in 90 utility service territories across 18 states. 
    
  We operate these businesses in two operating segments: 

Retail Natural Gas Segment  . We purchase natural gas supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparts and supply natural gas to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price, variable-price and flat-rate contracts. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately   9%   and   16%  , respectively, of our retail revenues were derived from the sale of natural gas. We also identify wholesale natural gas arbitrage opportunities in conjunction with our retail procurement and hedging activities, which we refer to as asset optimization.  

Retail Electricity Segment  . We purchase electricity supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparts and ISOs and supply electricity to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price and variable-price contracts. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately   91%   and   84%  , respectively, of our retail revenues were derived from the sale of electricity.  
       
  Acquisitions 
    
  Acquisition of the Provider Companies  
    
  On August 1, 2016, the Company and Spark HoldCo completed the purchase of all of the outstanding membership interests in the retail energy providers. Electricity Maine, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC, and Provider Power Mass, LLC, (the  Provider Companies ), which are all Maine limited liability companies. The Provider Companies serve electrical customers in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and had approximately 121,000 RCEs on August 1, 2016.

  Investment in eREX Spark Marketing Joint Venture 
    
  The Company and Spark HoldCo, together with eREX Co., Ltd., a Japanese company, are joint venture partners in eREX Spark Marketing Co., Ltd ("ESM"). Operations for ESM began on April 1, 2016 in connection with the deregulation of the Japanese power market. ESM has received more than 30,000 customer applications, which are currently excluded from our count of residential customer equivalents ("RCEs"). 

Drivers of our Business 
    
  Customer Growth 
    
  Customer growth is a key driver of our operations. Our customer growth strategy includes acquiring customers through acquisitions as well as organically.  
    
  Acquisitions.   Our Founder formed NG E in 2015 for the purpose of purchasing retail energy companies and retail customer books that could ultimately be resold to us. We currently expect that we would fund any potential drop-downs with some combination of cash, subordinated debt, or the issuance of Class B common stock (and corresponding Spark HoldCo units) to NG E. However, actual consideration paid for the assets will depend, among other things, on our capital structure and liquidity at the time of any drop-down. This drop-down strategy affords us access to opportunities that might not otherwise be available to us due to our size and availability of capital.  
    
  Additionally, we may independently acquire both portfolios of customers as well as smaller retail energy companies through some combination of cash, borrowings under the Acquisition Line (defined below) of the Senior Credit Facility (defined below), through the issuance of Class A common stock to the public, or through financing arrangements with our Founder and his affiliates, however there is no guarantee that we will continue to do so.  
    
  Organic Growth.   Our organic sales strategies are used to both maintain and grow our customer base by offering competitive pricing, price certainty and/or green product offerings. We manage growth on a market-by-market basis by developing price curves in each of the markets we serve and comparing the market prices to the price the local regulated utility is offering. We then determine if there is an opportunity in a particular market based on our ability to create a competitive product on economic terms that satisfies our profitability objectives and provides customer value. We develop marketing campaigns using a combination of sales channels, with an emphasis on door-to-door marketing and outbound telemarketing given their flexibility and historical effectiveness. We identify and acquire customers through a variety of additional sales channels, including our inbound customer care call center, online marketing, email, direct mail, affinity programs, direct sales, brokers and consultants. As we continue to grow our customer count it is more difficult to achieve higher growth rates organically. Our marketing team continuously evaluates the effectiveness of each customer acquisition channel and makes adjustments in order to achieve desired growth and profitability targets. 
    
  Customer Acquisition Cost 
    
  Management of customer acquisition costs is a key component to our profitability. Customer acquisition costs are spending for organic customer acquisitions and do not include customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customer contracts, which are recorded as customer relationships. 
    
  We attempt to maintain a disciplined approach to recovery of our customer acquisition costs within defined periods. We capitalize and amortize our customer acquisition costs over a two year period, which is based on the expected average length of a customer relationship. We factor in the recovery of customer acquisition costs in determining  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

which markets we enter and the pricing of our products in those markets. Accordingly, our results are significantly influenced by our customer acquisition spending. 
    
  Customer acquisition cost for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $8.2 million  , inclusive of costs attributable to the Provider Companies and Major Energy Companies. During the first half of 2016, we reduced the amount we spent on organic customer acquisition cost in order to maintain, rather than grow, our current level of RCEs, and shifted our resources to acquisitions. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we have increased our spending on organic customer acquisitions as we refocus on organic growth for the second half of 2016.     
    
  Our Ability to Manage Customer Attrition 
    
  Customer attrition is primarily due to: (i) customer initiated switches; (ii) residential moves and (iii) disconnection for customer payment defaults.  
    
  Customer attrition for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.8%  . Our customer attrition has been lower in recent quarters as we have increased our focus on the acquisition of higher lifetime value customers.  We have also increased our customer win-back efforts, and have more aggressively pursued proactive renewals and other customer relationship strategies to maintain a low level of customer attrition. 
    
  Customer Credit Risk 
    
  Our bad debt expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was less than   1.0%   of non-POR market retail revenues. An increased focus on collection efforts and timely billing along with tighter credit requirements for new enrollments in non-POR markets have led to a reduction in the bad debt expense in 2016. We have also been able to collect on debts that we have previously written off, which have further reduced our bad debt expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Weather Conditions 
    
  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for natural gas and electricity and affect the prices of energy commodities. Our hedging strategy is based on forecasted customer energy usage, which can vary substantially as a result of weather patterns deviating from historical norms. We are particularly sensitive to this variability because of our current substantial concentration and focus on growth in the residential customer segment in which energy usage is highly sensitive to weather conditions that impact heating and cooling demand. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced warmer than normal weather conditions, which positively impacted overall customer usage. 
    
  Asset Optimization 
    
  Our natural gas business includes opportunistic transactions in the natural gas wholesale marketplace in conjunction with our retail procurement and hedging activities. Asset optimization opportunities primarily arise during the winter heating season when demand for natural gas is the highest. As such, the majority of our asset optimization profits are made in the winter. Given the opportunistic nature of these activities, we experience variability in our earnings from our asset optimization activities from year to year. As these activities are accounted for using mark to-market fair value accounting, the timing of our revenue recognition often differs from the actual cash settlement. 
    
  Net asset optimization results were a   gain   of   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to limited arbitrage opportunities we captured during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , offset by   $0.9 million   of our annual legacy demand charges allocated to the quarter. During the full year   2016  , we are obligated to pay demand charges of approximately   $2.6 million   under certain long-term legacy transportation assets that our predecessor entity acquired prior to 2013.

Factors Affecting Comparability of Historical Financial Results  
    
  Presentation of the Acquisition of the Major Energy Companies  
    
  On April 15, 2016, NG E completed its acquisition of the Major Energy Companies. On May 3, 2016, the Company and Spark HoldCo, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Major Purchase Agreement") with Retailco and NG E for the purchase of all the membership interests of the Major Energy Companies. The Company completed the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies from NG E on August 23, 2016. Because the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies was a transfer of equity interests of entities under common control, the Company's historical financial statements previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form 10-Q to include the results attributable to the Major Energy Companies from April 15, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for this recasted period have been prepared from NG E's historical cost-basis and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred had the Company owned the Major Energy Companies during the recasted period. 

How We Evaluate Our Operations 

Adjusted EBITDA  . We define  Adjusted EBITDA  as EBITDA less (i) customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period, (ii) net gain (loss) on derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments, plus (iv) non-cash compensation expense and (v) other non-cash operating items. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before provision for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. 
    
  We deduct all current period customer acquisition costs (representing spending for organic customer acquisitions) in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred, even though we capitalize such costs and amortize them over two years in accordance with our accounting policies. The deduction of current period customer acquisition costs is consistent with how we manage our business, but the comparability of Adjusted EBITDA between periods may be affected by varying levels of customer acquisition costs. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA is lower in periods of organic customer growth reflecting larger organic customer acquisition spending.  
    
  We do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculated Adjusted EBITDA. 
    
  We deduct our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments. We also deduct non-cash compensation expense as a result of restricted stock units that are issued under our long-term incentive plan. 
    
  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following: 

46 

     Table of Contents  

our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 
                
    the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends; and 
                
    our ability to fund capital expenditures (including customer acquisition costs) and incur and service debt. 
       
  Retail Gross Margin.   We define retail gross margin as operating income plus (i) depreciation and amortization expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses, less (i) net asset optimization revenues, (ii) net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments. Retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non-cash income (loss) impact of our economic hedging activities.  
    
  We believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business's operating performance. 
    
  The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Retail Gross Margin is operating income. Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or operating income. Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Retail Gross Margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  
  Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision-making process.

This   increase   was primarily attributable to increased billing and other variable costs associated with increased RCEs as a result of the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and the Major Energy Companies and increased stock-based compensation associated with higher stock prices and additional equity awards, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense as we had better than anticipated collections as a result of new collection initiatives.

General and Administrative Expense  . General and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $55.2 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $11.3 million  , or   26%  , as compared to   $43.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to increased billing and other variable costs associated with increased RCEs, including those added as a result of the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and the Major Energy Companies, increased stock-based compensation associated with higher stock prices and additional equity awards, and additional litigation expense. This increase was partially offset by cost reductions from the Master Service Agreement with Retailco Services and lower overall bad debt expense as we had better than anticipated collections as a result of new collection initiatives, and as the impact of attrition in the Southern California market was limited to 2015.  
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  .

This   increase   was primarily due to the increased amortization expense associated with customer intangibles from the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and the Major Energy Companies and other acquisitions of retail customer books.   
    
  Customer Acquisition Cost  . Customer acquisition cost for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $15.2 million  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $2.5 million  , or   14%  , from approximately   $17.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to our decreased organic sales in the first half of 2016 as we had shifted our focus to growth through acquisitions.

  Retail Natural Gas Segment 
  Total revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were approximately   $13.9 million  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $0.5 million  , or   4%  , from approximately   $14.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily attributable to lower rates driven by the lower commodity pricing environment, which resulted in a decrease in total revenues of   $2.1 million  , partially offset by an increase of   $0.9 million   due to higher customer sales volumes driven by the addition of customers through our Major Energy Companies acquisition, as well as a $0.7 million increase in net asset optimization revenues. 
  Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $9.2 million  ,   a decrease   of   $1.0 million  , or   9%  , from approximately   $10.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily due to the change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging, which resulted in a decrease of $1.5 million, partially offset by the addition of customers through our Major Energy Companies acquisition, which resulted in an increase of   $0.4 million  .  
  Retail gross margin for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $6.0 million  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $1.7 million  , or   23%  , from approximately   $7.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , as indicated in the table below (in millions).

Retail Electricity Segment 
  Total revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were approximately   $144.2 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $67.3 million  , or   88%  , from approximately   $76.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was largely because of an increase in volumes, primarily due to our acquisition of the Major Energy Companies and the Provider Companies, as well as organic growth in the East, resulting in an increase of   $78.2 million  . This increase was partially offset by lower customer pricing, driven by the lower commodity pricing environment from milder than anticipated weather, which resulted in a decrease of   $10.9 million  . 
  Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $113.6 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $62.8 million  , or   124%  , from approximately   $50.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to the addition of customers through our acquisitions of the Major Energy Companies and the Provider Companies, as well as organic growth in the East, resulting in an increase of   $58.9 million  .  We additionally recognized a change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging, which resulted in an increase of $15.7 million.  These increases were partially offset by decreased supply costs, which resulted in a decrease of   $11.8 million  .  
  Retail gross margin for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $39.2 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $20.3 million  , or   107%  , from approximately   $18.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , as indicated in the table below (in millions).

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Retail Natural Gas Segment 
  Total revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were approximately   $84.5 million  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $8.8 million  , or   9%  , from approximately   $93.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was primarily attributable to lower rates driven by the lower commodity pricing environment, which resulted in a decrease in total revenues of   $10.6 million  , and a decrease of   $1.4 million   in net optimization revenues, partially offset by an increase in customer sales volume resulting from the acquisitions of Major Energy Companies, which increased total revenues by   $3.2 million  .  
  Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $39.0 million  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $14.1 million  , or   27%  , from approximately   $53.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was due to decreased supply costs, which resulted in a decrease of   $15.2 million  , and a decrease of $0.9 million in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of   $2.0 million   related to increased volume resulting from the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies. 
  Retail gross margin for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $41.4 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $5.8 million  , or   16%  , from approximately   $35.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as indicated in the table below (in millions).

Retail Electricity Segment 
  Total revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were approximately   $293.6 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $123.5 million  , or   73%  , from approximately   $170.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to an increase in volume from the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies and the Provider Companies and the addition of several higher volume commercial customers in the East, which resulted in an increase in revenues of   $156.6 million  . This increase was partially offset by a decrease in electricity pricing, driven by the lower commodity pricing environment from milder than anticipated weather, which resulted in a decrease of   $33.1 million  . 
  Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $209.6 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $86.7 million  , or   71%  , from approximately   $122.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to an increase in volume as a result of the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies and the Provider Companies and the addition of higher volume commercial customers in the East, which resulted in an increase of   $116.4 million  . Additionally, there was an increase of   $1.8 million   due to a change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging.  These increases were partially offset by decreased commodity prices, which resulted in a decrease in retail cost of revenues of   $31.5 million  .  
  Retail gross margin for the Retail Electricity Segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $82.2 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $38.5 million  , or   88%  , from approximately   $43.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as indicated in the table below (in millions).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our liquidity requirements fluctuate with our customer acquisition costs, acquisitions, collateral posting requirements on our derivative instruments portfolio, distributions, the effects of the timing between payments of payables and receipts of receivables, including bad debt receivables, and our general working capital needs for ongoing operations. Our borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are also subject to material variations on a seasonal basis due to the timing of commodity purchases to satisfy required natural gas inventory purchases and to meet customer demands during periods of peak usage. Moreover, estimating our liquidity requirements is highly dependent on then-current market conditions, including forward prices for natural gas and electricity, and market volatility. 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to sustain current operations and to pay required taxes and quarterly cash distributions including the quarterly dividend to the holders of the Class A common stock for the next twelve months. 
    
  The covenants under the Senior Credit Facility require us to hold increasing levels of net working capital over time. The Senior Credit Facility, as amended, includes a $25 million secured revolving line of credit ("Acquisition Line") for the purpose of financing permitted acquisitions, which enables us to pursue growth through acquisitions. We are obligated to make payments outstanding under the Acquisition Line of 25% per year with the balance due at maturity, which in turn increases availability under the line. We are constrained in our ability to grow through acquisitions using financing under the Senior Credit Facility to the extent we have utilized the capacity under this Acquisition Line.  The Senior Credit Facility will mature on July 8, 2017 and may be extended for one additional year with lender consent.  We intend to negotiate the extension of the Senior Credit Facility during the first half of 2017.  We believe we will be able to renegotiate and extend the Senior Credit Facility on commercially reasonable terms. 
    
  In addition, the Senior Credit Facility requires us to finance permitted acquisitions with at least 25% of either cash on hand, equity contributions or subordinated debt. We have historically issued convertible subordinated notes and Class B common stock (and corresponding Spark HoldCo units) to an affiliate of our Founder and majority stockholder in order to finance acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our Founder and majority stockholder and their affiliates will continue to finance our acquisition activities through such notes and Class B common stock (and corresponding Spark HoldCo units). 
    
  In connection with this acquisition strategy, Retailco periodically sells shares of our Class A common stock into the market for the purposes of financing the underlying transactions. Our prospects could be negatively impacted if Retailco was unable to make such sales to fund its acquisition of assets to drop down to us. 
    
  On October 7, 2016, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 covering offers and sales, from time to time, by us of up to $200,000,000 of Class A common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants, and by the selling stockholders named therein of up to 11,339,563 shares of Class A common stock. The registration statement was declared effective on October 20, 2016.  
    
  Based upon our current plans, level of operations and business conditions, we believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and working capital needs. We believe that the financing of any additional growth through acquisitions in 2016 and early 2017 may require further equity financing and/or further expansion of our Senior Credit Facility to accommodate such growth.

  Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included approximately   $15.2 million   for customer acquisitions and   $1.8 million   related to information systems improvements.  
  The Spark HoldCo, LLC Agreement provides, to the extent cash is available, for distributions pro rata to the holders of Spark HoldCo units such that we receive an amount of cash sufficient to cover the estimated taxes payable by us, the targeted quarterly dividend we intend to pay to holders of our Class A common stock, and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement we have entered into with Spark HoldCo, Retailco and NuDevco Retail. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid dividends to holders of our Class A common stock related to the three months ended December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 in the amount of $0.3625 per share for each dividend declaration, or   $6.0 million   in the aggregate. On   October 27, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3625 per share for the third quarter of 2016 to holders of the Class A common stock on   December 1, 2016  . This dividend will be paid on   December 14, 2016  . The dividends that we anticipate paying on an annualized basis equal approximately $1.45 per share or $9.4 million in the aggregate on an annualized basis based on 6,496,559 shares of Class A common stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on many factors, including the performance of our business in the future and restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility. The financial covenants included in the Senior Credit Facility require the Company to retain increasing amounts of working capital over time, which may have the effect of restricting our ability to pay dividends. Management does not currently believe that the financial covenants in the Senior Credit Facility will cause any such restrictions. 
    
  In order to pay our stated dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and corresponding distributions to holders of our non-controlling interest, Spark HoldCo generally is required to distribute approximately $  $14.8 million   on an annualized basis to holders of Spark HoldCo units based on   10,224,242   shares of Class B common stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . If our business does not generate enough cash for Spark HoldCo to make such distributions, we may have to borrow to pay our dividend. If our business generates cash in excess of the amounts required to pay an annual dividend of $1.45 per share of Class A common stock, we currently expect to reinvest any such excess cash flows in our business and not increase the dividends payable to holders of our Class A common stock. However, our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including the results of our operations, our financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities.  
    
  We expect to make payments pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement that we have entered into with Retailco LLC (as assignee of NuDevco Retail Holdings), NuDevco Retail and Spark HoldCo in connection with the Initial Public Offering of Spark Energy, Inc. Except in cases where we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control) or we have available cash but fail to make payments when due, generally we may elect to defer payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement for up to five years if we do not have available cash to satisfy our payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if our contractual obligations limit our ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will accrue interest. If we were to defer substantial payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement on an ongoing basis, the accrual of those obligations would reduce the availability of cash for other purposes, but we would not be prohibited from paying dividends on our Class A common stock.

We met the threshold coverage ratio required to fund the first TRA Payment to Retailco and NuDevco Retail under the Tax Receivable Agreement during the four-quarter period ending September 30, 2016, resulting in an initial TRA Payment of $1.4 million becoming due in December 2016. On November 6, 2016, Retailco and NuDevco Retail granted the Company the right to defer the TRA Payment until May 2018. During the period of time when the Company has elected to defer the TRA Payment, the outstanding payment amount will accrue interest at a rate calculated in the manner provided for under the Tax Receivable Agreement.  The liability has been classified as non-current in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. See Note   11    Transactions with Affiliates  and Note 14 "Subsequent Events" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the Tax Receivable Agreement.

  Pacific Summit Energy LLC 
  The Major Energy Companies acquired by the Company are party to three trade credit arrangements with Pacific Summit Energy LLC ( Pacific Summit ), which consist of purchase agreements, operating agreements relating to purchasing terms, security agreements, lockbox agreements and guarantees, providing for the exclusive supply of gas and electricity on credit by Pacific Summit to the Major Energy Companies for resale to end users.  
  The arrangements allow the Major Energy Companies to purchase gas and electricity on credit at fixed prices or prices to be determined at the time of the transaction confirmation. Under the arrangements, when the costs that Pacific Summit has paid to procure and deliver the gas and electricity exceed the payments that the Major Energy Companies have made attributable to the gas and electricity purchased, the Major Energy Companies incur interest on the difference at the floating 90-day LIBOR rate plus 300 basis points. The outstanding balance of the difference may not exceed $15.0 million for MES, and $20.0 million for each of MEES and Respond. The operating agreements also allow Pacific Summit to provide credit support, with a limit of $10.0 million for MES and $20.0 million for each of MEES and Respond, which also incurs interest at the floating 90-day LIBOR rate plus 300 basis points (except for certain credit support guaranties that do not bear interest). In connection with these arrangements, the Major Companies have granted first liens to Pacific Summit on a substantial portion of the Major Companies  assets, including present and future accounts receivable, inventory, liquid assets, and control agreements relating to bank accounts.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company had aggregate outstanding payables under these arrangements of approximately   $13.4 million  , bearing an interest rate of   3.9%  . The Company was also the beneficiary of various credit support guarantees issued by Pacific Summit under these arrangements as of such date. 
  Pursuant to the operating agreements and the lockbox agreements, payments from the Major Energy Companies are placed into a secured lockbox. The Major Energy Companies are required to maintain a minimum balance in the lockbox accounts, and payments from the lockbox are made to Pacific Summit prior to any payment to the Major Energy Companies. To secure the payment obligations of the Major Energy Companies under the arrangements, Pacific Summit has a security interest, in among other things, funds in the lockbox account, certain accounts receivable and inventory supplied by Pacific Summit. Each of the Major Energy Companies has also guaranteed the payment obligations of the other Major Energy Companies under these arrangements.   
  Each of the arrangements has a primary term expiring on March 31, 2017, which term automatically renews for one year periods unless either party notifies the other 180 days prior to the expiration of the term. On September 27, 2016, we notified Pacific Summit of our election to trigger the expiration of these arrangements as of March 31, 2017, at the end of the primary term.

  Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities  . Cash flows provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $22.0 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail gross margin in 2016, including the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and the Major Energy Companies. 
    
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities  . Cash flows used in investing activities   decreased   by   $8.6 million   for the 
  nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which was primarily due to the acquisitions of the Provider Companies and the Major Energy Companies. 
    
  Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities  . Cash flows used in financing activities   increased   by   $21.2 million   for the 
  nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to additional dividends and distributions, respectively, made to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and increased net payments under our Senior Credit Facility. 
    
  Senior Credit Facility 
    
  The Company, as guarantor, and Spark HoldCo (the  Borrower,  and together with Spark Energy, LLC, Spark Energy Gas, LLC, CenStar Energy Corp, CenStar Operating Company, LLC, Oasis Power Holdings, LLC and Oasis Power, LLC, Electricity Maine, LLC, Electricity N.H., LLC and Provider Power Mass, LLC, each a subsidiary of Spark HoldCo, the  Co-Borrowers ) are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended ( Senior Credit Facility ).  
    
  On June 1, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Senior Credit Facility to, among other things, increase the Working Capital Line (defined below) from $60.0 million to $82.5 million in accordance with the Co-Borrowers' right to increase under the existing terms of the Senior Credit Facility. Amendment No. 3 also provides for the addition of new lenders and re-allocates working capital and revolving commitments among existing and new lenders. Amendment No. 3 also provides for additional representations of the Co-Borrowers and additional protections of the lenders of the Senior Credit Facility.  
    
  The Company and the Co-Borrowers have entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Credit Facility, effective August 1, 2016, to, among other things, provide for the acquisition of the Provider Companies and also provide for certain additional amendments automatically upon the closing of the acquisition of the Major Energy Companies. Upon such closing, the Major Energy Companies became unrestricted subsidiaries, as that term is defined in the Senior Credit Facility. Amendment No. 4 also raised the minimum availability under the Working Capital Line to $40.0 million. On September 30, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers elected to reduce the capacity of the Working Capital Line from $82.5 million to $60.0 million. 
    
  The Senior Credit Facility, as amended, includes a senior secured revolving working capital facility of $60.0 million ("Working Capital Line") and a $25.0 million secured revolving Acquisition Line, to be used specifically for the financing of up to 75% of the cost of acquisitions with the remainder to be financed by the Company either through cash on hand or the issuance of subordinated debt or equity. The Senior Credit Facility will mature on July 8, 2017  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

and may be extended for one additional year with lender consent. Borrowings under the Acquisition Line will be repaid 25% per year with the remainder due at maturity. 
  At the Borrower s election, the interest rate under the Working Capital Line is generally determined by reference to: 
             
    the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 3.00% per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization); or 
                
    the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 2.00% per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). The alternate base rate is equal to the highest of (i) Soci t  G n rale s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, or (iii) the reference Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%; or 
                
    the rate quoted by Soci t  G n rale as its cost of funds for the requested credit plus up to 2.50% per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). 
       
  The interest rate is generally reduced by 25 basis points if utilization under the Working Capital Line is below fifty percent.  
    
  Borrowings under the Acquisition Line are generally determined by reference to: 
             
    the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 3.75% per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization); or 
                
    the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 2.75% per annum (based upon the prevailing utilization). The alternate base rate is equal to the highest of (i) Soci t  G n rale's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, or (iii) the reference Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%. 
       
  The Co-Borrowers pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% or 0.50% on the unused portion of the Working Capital Line depending upon the unused capacity and 0.50% on the unused portion of the Acquisition Line. The lending syndicate under the Senior Credit Facility is entitled to several additional fees including an upfront fee, annual agency fee, and fronting fees based on a percentage of the face amount of letters of credit payable to any syndicate member that issues a letter a credit. 
    
  The Company has the ability to elect the availability under the Working Capital Line between $40.0 million to $82.5 million. On September 30, 2016, the Company and the Co-Borrowers elected an availability of $60.0 million under the Working Capital Line. Availability under the working capital line is subject to borrowing base limitations. The borrowing base is calculated primarily based on 80% to 90% of the value of eligible accounts receivable and unbilled product sales (depending on the credit quality of the counterparties) and inventory and other working capital assets. The Co-Borrowers must generally seek approval of the Agent or the lenders for permitted acquisitions to be financed under the Acquisition Line.  
    
  The Senior Credit Facility is secured by pledges of the equity of the portion of Spark HoldCo owned by the Company and of the equity of Spark HoldCo s subsidiaries (excluding the Major Energy Companies) and the Co-Borrowers  present and future subsidiaries, all of the Co-Borrowers  and their subsidiaries  present and future property and assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and liquid investments, and control agreements relating to bank accounts.  The Major Energy Companies are excluded from the definition of "Borrowers" under the Senior Credit Facility.  Accordingly, we do not factor in their working capital into our working capital covenants. 
    
  The Senior Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of specified ratios or conditions as follows: 

Minimum Net Working Capital  . The Co-Borrowers must maintain minimum consolidated net working capital through December 30, 2016 equal to the greater of $5.0 million or 10% of the elected availability under the Working Capital Line, and from December 31, 2016 and thereafter equal to the greater of $5.0 million or 15% of the elected availability under the Working Capital Line. 

Minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth  . The Co-Borrowers must maintain a minimum consolidated adjusted tangible net worth at all times equal to the net cash proceeds from equity issuances occurring after the date  
     
   59 

     Table of Contents  

of the Senior Credit Facility plus the greater of (i) 20% of aggregate commitments under the Working Capital Line plus 33% of borrowings under the Acquisition Line and (ii) $18.0 million. 

Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  . Spark Energy, Inc. must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00 (with quarterly increases to the numerator of increments of 0.05 up to a maximum of 1.25). The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) the sum of consolidated interest expense (other than interest paid-in-kind in respect of any Subordinated Debt), letter of credit fees, commitment fees, acquisition earn-out payments, distributions and scheduled amortization payments. 

Maximum Total Leverage Ratio  . Spark Energy, Inc. must maintain a ratio of total indebtedness (excluding the Working Capital Facility and qualifying subordinated debt) to Adjusted EBITDA of a maximum of 2.50 to 1.00. 
       
  The Senior Credit Facility contains various negative covenants that limit the Company s ability to, among other things, do any of the following: 

incur certain additional indebtedness; 
                
    grant certain liens; 
                
    engage in certain asset dispositions; 
                
    merge or consolidate; 
                
    make certain payments, distributions, investments, acquisitions or loans; or 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates. 
       
  Spark Energy, Inc. is entitled to pay cash dividends to the holders of the Class A common stock and Spark HoldCo is entitled to make cash distributions to NuDevco Retail Holdings, LLC so long as: (a) no default exists or would result from such a payment; (b) the Co-Borrowers are in pro forma compliance with all financial covenants before and after giving effect to such payment and (c) the outstanding amount of all loans and letters of credit does not exceed the borrowing base limits. Spark HoldCo s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants or the existence of an event of default, if not cured or waived, under the Senior Credit Facility could prevent the Company from paying dividends to holders of the Class A common stock.  
    
  The Senior Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties and events of default. Events of default include, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults and cross-acceleration to certain indebtedness, change in control in which affiliates of W. Keith Maxwell III own less than 40% of the outstanding voting interests in the Company, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, material judgments in excess of $5.0 million, certain events with respect to material contracts, actual or asserted failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the Senior Credit Facility to be in full force and effect and changes of control. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.           
  Master Service Agreement with Retailco Services, LLC  
    
  We entered into a Master Service Agreement (the  Master Service Agreement ), effective January 1, 2016, with Retailco Services, LLC ("Retailco Services"), which is wholly owned by W. Keith Maxwell III. The Master Service Agreement is for a one-year term and renews automatically for successive one-year terms unless the Master Service Agreement is terminated by either party. Retailco Services provides us with operational support services such as: enrollment and renewal transaction services; customer billing and transaction services; electronic payment processing services; customer services and information technology infrastructure and application support services under the Master Service Agreement.  
    
  During   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded general and administrative expense of   $2.9 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively, in connection with this Master Service Agreement.

Additionally, under the Master Service Agreement, we capitalized   $0.2 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, during   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of property and equipment for software and consultant time used in the application, development and implementation of various systems including customer billing and resource management systems. 
    
  Ongoing Obligations in Connection with Acquisitions 
    
  The Company is obligated to make earnout and installment payments in connection with the acquisitions of the Major Energy Companies and Provider Companies as more fully described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   In the case of the Major Energy Companies acquisition, these payments could be as much as $35 million depending upon operating results and the customer counts through 2019.  See further discussion related to the valuation of the earnouts in Note 8, Fair Value Measurements.  See also "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions - Acquisition of the Major Energy Companies." 
    
  Convertible Subordinated Notes to Affiliate  
    
  The Company from time to time issues subordinated debt to affiliates of Retailco, which owns a majority of the Company s outstanding common stock and is indirectly owned by W. Keith Maxwell III, who serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company s Senior Credit Facility requires that at least 25% of permitted acquisitions thereunder be financed with either cash on hand or subordinated debt. 
    
  The Company has outstanding a convertible subordinated note to Retailco Acquisition Co, LLC ("RAC"), which is wholly owned by W. Keith Maxwell III, for $2.1 million. The convertible subordinated note matures on July 8, 2020, and bears interest at an annual rate of 5.00%. The Company has the right to pay interest in kind. The convertible subordinated note is convertible into shares of the Company s Class B common stock (and a related unit of Spark HoldCo) at a conversion price of $16.57. RAC may not exercise conversion rights for the first eighteen months that the convertible subordinated note is outstanding. The convertible subordinated note is subject to automatic conversion upon a sale of the Company. Shares of Class A common stock resulting from the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock issued as a result of the conversion right under the convertible subordinated note will be entitled to registration rights identical to the registration rights currently held by Retailco, LLC on shares of Class A common stock it receives upon conversion of its existing shares of Class B common stock. On October 5, 2016, RAC issued to the Company an irrevocable commitment to convert this convertible subordinated note into 134,731 shares of Class B common stock on January 8, 2017.   
    
  The Company has outstanding a convertible subordinated note to RAC for $5.0 million. The convertible subordinated note matures on July 31, 2020 and bears interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum payable semiannually. The Company has the right to pay interest in kind. The convertible subordinated note is convertible into shares of Class B common stock (and a related unit of Spark HoldCo) at a conversion rate of $14.00 per share. RAC cannot exercise any conversion rights for the first eighteen months that the convertible note is outstanding. The convertible subordinated note is subject to automatic conversion upon a sale of the Company. Shares of Class A common stock resulting from the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock issued as a result of the conversion right under the convertible subordinated note are entitled to registration rights identical to the registration rights currently held by Retailco, LLC on shares of Class A common stock it receives upon conversion of its existing shares of Class B common stock. On October 5, 2016, RAC issued to the Company an irrevocable commitment to convert this convertible subordinated note into 383,090 shares of Class B common stock on January 31, 2017.   
    
  Each of the convertible subordinated notes is subordinated in certain respects to the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a subordination agreement. The Company may pay interest and prepay principal on the convertible subordinated notes so long as the Company is in compliance with its covenants, is not in default under the Senior Credit Facility and has minimum availability of $5.0 million under its borrowing base under the Senior Credit Facility.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09"),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 ("ASU 2015-14"),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which deferred the effective date to periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is selecting a transition method and determining the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  The FASB issued additional amendments to ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14: 
             
    March 2016 - ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ("ASU 2016-08"). ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to customers.  
                
    April 2016 - ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ("ASU 2016-10"). ASU 2016-10 covers two specific topics: performance obligations and licensing. This amendment includes guidance on immaterial promised goods or services, shipping or handling activities, separately identifiable performance obligations, functional or symbolic intellectual property licenses, sales-based and usage-based royalties, license restrictions (time, use, geographical) and licensing renewals.  
                
    May 2016 - ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12"). ASU 2016-12 clarifies certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the full retrospective transition method is adopted. 
       
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 amends existing guidance to require subsequent measurement of inventory at the  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02")  .   ASU 2016-02 amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting by requiring entities to include substantially all leases on the balance sheet by requiring the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases. Entities may elect to not recognize leases with a maximum possible term of less than 12 months. For lessees, a lease is classified as finance or operating and the asset and liability are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. For lessors, accounting for leases is largely unchanged from previous guidance. ASU 2016-02 also requires qualitative disclosures along with certain specific quantitative disclosures for both lessees and lessors. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and are effective for interim periods in the year of adoption. The ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation     (Topic 718)   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for shared-based payments, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under current U.S. GAAP, excess tax benefits are currently recorded in equity and presented as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Upon adoption, excess tax benefits for share-based payments will be recorded as a reduction of income taxes and reflected in operating cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a current expected credit loss ("CECL") model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The model requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected credit losses during the period. The measurement of expected losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues in the statement of cash flows. Those issues are cash payment for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instrument or other debt instrument with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; cash proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, cash received from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distribution received from equity method investees; beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method for each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740):     Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ).  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory.   Current U.S. GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including regulatory and other matters. 
  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
    
  For a discussion of the status of current litigation and governmental investigations, see Note   11    Commitments and Contingencies  in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Emerging Growth Company Status 
  We are an  emerging growth company  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, but we have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 
  We intend to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an  emerging growth company  upon the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.0 billion or more in annual revenues; (ii) the date on which we become a  large accelerated filer  (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more as of June 30); (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or (iv) the last day of 2019.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices and interest rates, as well as counterparty credit risk. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks.  
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We hedge and procure our energy requirements from various wholesale energy markets, including both physical and financial markets and through short and long term contracts. Our financial results are largely dependent on the margin we are able to realize between the wholesale purchase price of natural gas and electricity plus related costs and the retail sales price we charge our customers. We actively manage our commodity price risk by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from fixed-price forecasted sales and purchases of natural gas and electricity in connection with our retail energy operations. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, as well as over-the-counter markets. These contracts have varying terms and durations, which range from a few days to a few years, depending on the instrument. Our asset optimization group utilizes similar derivative contracts in connection with its trading activities to attempt to generate incremental gross margin by effecting transactions in markets where we have a retail presence. Generally, any of such instruments that are entered into to support our retail electricity and natural gas business are categorized as having been entered into for non-trading purposes, and instruments entered into for any other purpose are categorized as having been entered into for trading purposes. Our net gain (loss) on non-trading derivative instruments net of cash settlements was   $(10.1) million   and   $5.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  We have adopted risk management policies to measure and limit market risk associated with our fixed-price portfolio and our hedging activities. For additional information regarding our commodity price risk and our risk management policies, see  Item 1A Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We measure the commodity risk of our non-trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis on our net open position. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Gas Non-Trading Fixed Price Open Position (hedges net of retail load) was a long position of 268,249 MMBtu. An increase of 10% in the market prices (NYMEX) from their   September 30, 2016   levels would have increased the fair market value of our net non-trading energy portfolio by   $0.1 million  . Likewise, a decrease of 10% in the market prices (NYMEX) from their   September 30, 2016   levels would have decreased the fair market value of our non-trading energy derivatives by   $0.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our Electricity Non-Trading Fixed Price Open Position (hedges net of retail load) was a long position of 293,864 MWhs. An increase of 10% in the forward market prices from their   September 30, 2016   levels would have increased the fair market value of our net non-trading energy portfolio by   $1.2 million  . Likewise, a decrease of 10% in the forward market prices from their   September 30, 2016   levels would have decreased the fair market value of our non-trading energy derivatives by   $1.2 million  . 
    
  We measure the commodity risk of our trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis on our net open position. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have a Gas Trading Fixed Price Open Position. 
  Credit Risk  
    
  In many of the utility service territories where we conduct business, POR programs have been established, whereby the local regulated utility offers services for billing the customer, collecting payment from the customer and remitting payment to us. This service results in substantially all of our credit risk being linked to the applicable utility and not to our end-use customer in these territories. Approximately 69% and 68% of our retail revenues were derived from territories in which substantially all of our credit risk was directly linked to local regulated utility companies for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, all of which had investment grade ratings as of such date. During the same period, we paid these local regulated utilities a weighted average discount of approximately 1.43% and 1.39%, respectively, of total revenues for customer credit risk protection. In certain of the POR markets in which we operate, the utilities limit their collections exposure by retaining the ability to transfer  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

a delinquent account back to us for collection when collections are past due for a specified period. If our collection efforts are unsuccessful, we return the account to the local regulated utility for termination of service. Under these service programs, we are exposed to credit risk related to payment for services rendered during the time between when the customer is transferred to us by the local regulated utility and the time we return the customer to the utility for termination of service, which is generally one to two billing periods. We may also realize a loss on fixed-price customers in this scenario due to the fact that we will have already fully hedged the customer s expected commodity usage for the life of the contract. 
  In non-POR markets, we manage customer credit risk through formal credit review in the case of commercial customers, and credit score screening, deposits and disconnection for non-payment, in the case of residential customers. Economic conditions may affect our customers  ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense. Our bad debt expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was less than   1.0%   of non-POR market retail revenues. See  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Drivers of Our Business  for an analysis of our bad debt expense related to non-POR markets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We are exposed to wholesale counterparty credit risk in our retail and asset optimization activities. We manage this risk at a counterparty level and secure our exposure with collateral or guarantees when needed. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately 88% of our total exposure of   $3.4 million   was either with an investment grade customer or otherwise secured with collateral or a guarantee. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates under our variable-price debt obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , we were co-borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility, under which   $49.3 million   of variable rate indebtedness was outstanding. Based on the average amount of our variable rate indebtedness outstanding during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , a 1% percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional annual interest expense of approximately   $0.5 million  . We do not currently employ interest rate hedges, although we may choose to do so in the future.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   at the reasonable assurance level.  
    
  Management believes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
    
  We are the subject of lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and claims. While the lawsuits and claims are asserted for amounts that may be material should an unfavorable outcome occur, management does not currently expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note   11   "Commitments and Contingencies" to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain other proceedings. 
    
  The Company is the subject of the following lawsuits: 
    
  John Melville et al v. Spark Energy Inc. and Spark Energy Gas, LLC 
    
  John Melville et al v. Spark Energy Inc. and Spark Energy Gas, LLC   is a purported class action filed on December 17, 2015 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging, among other things, that (i) sales representatives engaged as independent contractors for Spark Energy Gas, LLC engaged in deceptive acts in violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and (ii) Spark Energy Gas, LLC  breached its contract with plaintiff, including a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for himself and the purported class, injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief, disgorgement of revenues and/or profits and attorneys  fees. On March 14, 2016, Spark Energy Gas, LLC and Spark Energy, Inc. filed a Motion to Dismiss this case. On April 18, 2016, Plaintiff filed his Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. On April 25, 2016, Spark Energy, Inc. and Spark Energy Gas, LLC filed a Reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss. The Motion to Dismiss was set on the Court's submission docket for May 2, 2016.  The parties are currently waiting on the Court s ruling.  Discovery has not yet commenced in this matter. We cannot predict the outcome or consequences of this case. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
    
  Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors under "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Other Information and in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (the "First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q"). There has been no material change in our risk factors from those described in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. These risks are not the sole risks for investors. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

This Plan shall be administered by the Committee except to the extent the Board elects to administer this Plan, in which case references herein to the  Committee  shall be deemed to include references to the  Board.   Subject to the express provisions of the Plan and Rule 16b-3, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (i) adopt, amend, and rescind administrative and interpretive rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (ii) determine the Eligible Persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted; (iii) determine the amount of cash and/or the number of shares of Stock, as applicable Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock Awards, Dividend Equivalents, Bonus Stock, Other Stock-Based Awards, Annual Incentive Awards, Performance Awards, or any combination thereof, that shall be the subject of each Award; (iv) determine the terms and provisions of each Award agreement (which need not be identical), including provisions defining or otherwise relating to (A) the term and the period or periods and extent of exercisability of the Options, (B) the extent to which the transferability of shares of Stock issued or transferred pursuant to any Award is restricted, (C) except as otherwise provided herein, the effect of termination of employment, or the service relationship with the Company, of a Participant on the Award, and (D) the effect of approved leaves of absence (consistent with any applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service); (v) accelerate the time of vesting or exercisability of any Award that has been granted; (vi) construe the respective Award agreements and the Plan; (vii) make determinations of the Fair Market Value of the Stock pursuant to the Plan; (viii) delegate its duties under the Plan (including, but not limited to, the authority to grant Awards) to such agents as it may appoint from time to time, provided that the Committee may not delegate its duties where such delegation would violate state corporate law, or with respect to making Awards to, or otherwise with respect to Awards granted to, Eligible Persons who are subject to section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or who are Covered Employees receiving Awards that are intended to constitute  performance-based compensation  within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Code; (ix)  subject to Section 10(f), terminate, modify or amend the Plan; (x) subject to the limitations set forth herein, amend any Award agreement; and (xi) make all other determinations, perform all other acts, and exercise all other powers and authority necessary or advisable for administering the Plan, including the delegation of those ministerial acts and responsibilities as the Committee deems appropriate.

The determinations of the Committee on the matters referred to in this Section 3(a) shall be final and conclusive. 
  (b)        Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority  .  At any time that a member of the Committee is not a Qualified Member, any action of the Committee relating to an Award granted or to be granted to an Eligible Person who is then subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company, or relating to an Award intended by the Committee to qualify as  performance-based compensation  within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder, may be taken either (i) by a subcommittee, designated by the Committee, composed solely of two or more Qualified Members, (ii) by the Board or (iii) by the Committee but with each such member who is not a Qualified Member abstaining or recusing himself or herself from such action;   provided  ,   however  , that, upon such abstention or recusal, the Committee remains composed solely of two or more Qualified Members.  Such action, authorized by such a subcommittee or by the Committee upon the abstention or recusal of such non-Qualified Member(s), shall be the action of the Committee for purposes of this Plan.  Any action of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Persons, including the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parents, stockholders, Participants, Beneficiaries, and transferees under Section 10(b) hereof or other persons claiming rights from or through a Participant.  The express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Committee.  The Committee may delegate to officers or managers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parents, or committees thereof, the authority, subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine, to perform such functions, including administrative functions, as the Committee may determine, to the extent that such delegation will not result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)(1) for Awards granted to Participants subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company and will not cause Awards intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation  under section 162(m) of the Code to fail to so qualify.  The Committee may appoint agents to assist it in administering the Plan. 
  (c)        Limitation of Liability  .

Members of the Committee and any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents acting at the direction or on behalf of the Committee shall not be personally liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to this Plan, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be indemnified and held harmless by the Company with respect to any such action or determination. 
  (d)        No Repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights  . Other than pursuant to Section 9, neither the Board nor the Committee may provide for the repricing or exchange of underwater Options or SARs for cash consideration, other Awards, or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the original exercise price of such underwater Options or SARs, unless such repricing or exchange receives the approval of a majority of the holders of the Stock. 
  4.        Stock Subject to Plan  .   
  (a)        Overall Number of Shares Available for Delivery  .  Subject to adjustment in a manner consistent with any adjustment made pursuant to Section 9, the total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance in connection with Awards under this Plan shall not exceed 1,375,000 shares, and such total will be available for the issuance of Incentive Stock Options. 
  (b)        Application of Limitation to Grants of Awards  .  Subject to Section 4(e), no Award may be granted if the number of shares of Stock to be delivered in connection with such Award exceeds  the number of shares of Stock remaining available under this Plan minus the number of shares of Stock issuable in settlement of or relating to then-outstanding Awards.  The Committee may adopt reasonable counting procedures to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double counting (as, for example, in the case of tandem or substitute awards) and make adjustments if the number of shares of Stock actually delivered differs from the number of shares previously counted in connection with an Award. 
  (c)        Availability of Shares Not Issued under Awards  .  Shares of Stock subject to an Award under this Plan that expire or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged, settled in cash or otherwise terminated, including (i) shares forfeited with respect to Restricted Stock, (ii) shares tendered or withheld in payment of any exercise or purchase price of an Award or taxes relating to an Award and (iii) shares that were subject to an Option or an SAR and were not issued or delivered upon the net settlement or net exercise of such Option or SAR, shall be available again for issuance in connection with Awards under the Plan, except that if any such shares could not again be available for Awards to a particular Participant under any applicable law or regulation, such shares shall be available exclusively for Awards to Participants who are not subject to such limitation. 
  (d)        Stock Offered  .  The shares to be delivered under the Plan shall be made available from (i) authorized but unissued shares of Stock, (ii) Stock held in the treasury of the Company, (iii) previously issued shares of Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased on the open market, or (iv) effective September 1, 2016, Stock held by any Parent or Subsidiary. 
  5.        Eligibility  .  Awards may be granted under this Plan only to Persons who are Eligible Persons at the time of grant thereof.   
  6.        Specific Terms of Awards  .   
  (a)        General  .  Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6.  In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter (subject to Section 10(f)), such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, as the Committee shall determine, including terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in the event of termination of employment by the Participant, or termination of the Participant s service relationship with the Company, and terms permitting a Participant to make elections relating to his or her Award.  The Committee shall retain full power and discretion to accelerate, waive or modify, at any time, any term or condition of an Award that is not mandatory under this Plan;   provided  ,   however  , that the Committee shall not have any discretion to accelerate, waive or modify any term or condition of an Award that is intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation  for purposes of section 162(m) of the Code if such discretion would cause the Award to not so qualify or to accelerate the terms of payment of any Award that provides for a deferral of compensation under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules if such acceleration would subject a Participant to additional taxes under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. 
  (b)        Options  .  The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: 
  (i)        Exercise Price  .  The exercise price per share of Stock subject to an Option shall not be less than the greater of (1) the par value per share of the Stock and (2) 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock as of the date of grant of the Option (or in the case of an ISO granted to an individual who owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or its parent or any subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code), 110% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock on the date of grant); provided, however, nothing in this Section 6(b)(i) is intended to limit the ability of the Company to assume or otherwise grant Options in substitution of awards in connection with any merger, stock purchase, recapitalization or other corporate transaction.   
  (ii)        Time and Method of Exercise  .  The Committee shall determine the time or times at which or the circumstances under which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), the methods by which such Exercise Price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such payment, including without limitation cash, Stock, other Awards or awards granted under other plans of the Company or any Subsidiary, or other property (including notes or other contractual obligations of Participants to make payment on a deferred basis), and the methods by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants, including, but not limited to, the delivery of Restricted Stock subject to Section 6(d).  In the case of an exercise whereby the Exercise Price is paid with Stock, such Stock shall be valued as of the date of exercise. The Award agreement governing each Option shall set forth the last date that the Option may be exercised (the  Option Expiration Date ) and may provide (A) for the automatic exercise of such Option on the Option Expiration Date if the exercise price per share of the Stock under the Option is less than the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock on the Option Expiration Date and the Participant has not previously exercised such Option, or (B) except with respect to an ISO, that in the event trading in the Stock is prohibited by applicable law, the term of the Option shall automatically be extended until the date that is 30 days after such prohibition is lifted, to the extent that such extension does not cause the Participant to become subject to taxation under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Rules. 
  (iii)        ISOs  .  The terms of any ISO granted under this Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of section 422 of the Code.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9, no term of this Plan relating to ISOs (including any SAR in tandem therewith) shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under this Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify either this Plan or any ISO under section 422 of the Code, unless the Participant has first requested the change that will result in such disqualification.  ISOs shall not be granted more than ten years after the earlier of the adoption of this Plan or the approval of this Plan by the Company s stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock subject to an ISO and the aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of stock of any parent or subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code) subject to any other ISO (within the meaning of section 422 of the Code)) of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code) that first becomes purchasable by a Participant in any calendar year may not (with respect to that Participant) exceed $100,000, or such other amount as may be prescribed under section 422 of the Code or applicable regulations or rulings from time to time.  As used in the previous sentence, Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the date the ISOs are granted.  Failure to comply with this provision shall not impair the enforceability or exercisability of any Option, but shall cause the excess amount of shares to be reclassified in accordance with the Code. 
  (iv)        Service Providers to Parents  .  To the extent an Option is granted to an Eligible Person who is an employee or service provider to any Parent of the Company, such Option is intended to be designed in a manner that is intended to comply with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. 
  (c)        Stock Appreciation Rights  .  The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions:  
  (i)        Right to Payment  .  An SAR shall confer on the Participant to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of exercise over (B) the grant price of the SAR as determined by the Committee;   provided, however  , that the grant price per share of the Stock under each SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of the Stock on the date the SAR is granted. 
  (ii)        Rights Related to Options  .  An SAR granted pursuant to an Option shall entitle a Participant, upon exercise, to surrender that Option or any portion thereof, to the extent unexercised, and to receive payment of an amount computed pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii)(B).  That Option shall then cease to be exercisable to the extent surrendered.  SARs granted in connection with an Option shall be subject to the terms of the Award agreement governing the Option, which shall comply with the following provisions in addition to those applicable to Options: 
  (A)        An SAR granted in connection with an Option shall be exercisable only at such time or times and only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall not be transferable except to the extent that the related Option is transferable. 
  (B)        Upon the exercise of an SAR related to an Option, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company of an amount determined by multiplying: 
  (1)        the difference obtained by subtracting the Exercise Price with respect to a share of Stock specified in the related Option from the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR, by 
  (2)        the number of shares as to which that SAR has been exercised. 
  (iii)        Right Without Option  .  An SAR granted independent of an Option shall be exercisable as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award agreement governing the SAR, which Award agreement shall comply with the following provisions: 
  (A)        Each Award agreement shall state the total number of shares of Stock to which the SAR relates. 
  (B)        Each Award agreement shall state the time or periods in which the right to exercise the SAR or a portion thereof shall vest and the number of shares of Stock for which the right to exercise the SAR shall vest at each such time or period. 
  (C)        Each Award agreement shall state the date at which the SARs shall expire if not previously exercised. 
  (D)        Each SAR shall entitle a Participant, upon exercise thereof, to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying: 
  (1)        the difference obtained by subtracting the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of the SAR from the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of that SAR, by 
  (2)        the number of shares as to which the SAR has been exercised. 
  (iv)        Terms  .

Accordingly, the terms of Sections 8(b), (c), (d) and (e), including the definitions of Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder.  The foregoing notwithstanding, because the Committee cannot determine with certainty whether a given Eligible Person will be a Covered Employee with respect to a fiscal year that has not yet been completed, the term Covered Employee as used herein shall mean only a Person designated by the Committee, at the time of grant of a Performance Award or an Annual Incentive Award, who is likely to be a Covered Employee with respect to that fiscal year.  If any provision of this Plan as in effect on the date of adoption of any agreements relating to Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards that are designated as intended to comply with section 162(m) of the Code does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(e) or elsewhere in this Plan, the Company intends to rely on the transition relief set forth in Treasury Regulation   1.162-27(f), and hence the deduction limitation imposed by section 162(m) of the Code will not be applicable to the Company until the earliest to occur of (i) the material modification of the Plan within the meaning of Treasury Regulation   1.162-27(h)(1)(iii); (ii) the issuance of the number of shares of Stock set forth in Section 4(a); or (iii)  the first meeting of shareholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected that occurs after December 31, 20__ (the  Transition Period ), and during the Transition Period, Awards to Covered Employees shall only be required to comply with the transition relief described in this Section 8(e).

  (ii)        If at any time, or from time to time, the Company shall consolidate as a whole (by reclassification, by reverse Stock split, or otherwise) the number of shares of Stock then outstanding into a lesser number of shares of Stock, (A)%8. the maximum number of shares of Stock for the Plan or available in connection with Awards as provided in Section 4 shall be decreased proportionately, and the kind of shares or other securities available for the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted, (B)%8. the number of shares of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) that may be acquired under any then outstanding Award shall be decreased proportionately, and (C)%8. the price (including the exercise price) for each share of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) subject to then outstanding Awards shall be increased proportionately, without changing the aggregate purchase price or value as to which outstanding Awards remain exercisable or subject to restrictions.

The Committee shall promptly provide each affected Participant with such notice. 
  (iv)        Adjustments under Sections 9(b)(i) and (ii) shall be made by the Committee, and its determination as to what adjustments shall be made and the extent thereof shall be final, binding, and conclusive.

  (c)        Corporate Recapitalization  .  If the Company recapitalizes, reclassifies its capital stock, or otherwise changes its capital structure (a  recapitalization ) without the occurrence of a Change in Control, the number and class of shares of Stock covered by an Option or an SAR theretofore granted shall be adjusted so that such Option or SAR shall thereafter cover the number and class of shares of stock and securities to which the holder would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the recapitalization if, immediately prior to the recapitalization, the holder had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Stock then covered by such Option or SAR and the share limitations provided in Sections 4 and 5 shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the recapitalization and the exercise prices and grant prices of such Awards shall, to the extent applicable, be adjusted accordingly. 
  (d)        Additional Issuances  .  Except as hereinbefore expressly provided, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash, property, labor or services, upon direct sale, upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, and in any case whether or not for fair value, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares of Stock subject to Awards theretofore granted or the purchase price per share, if applicable. 
  (e)        Change in Control  .  Upon a Change in Control the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any holder, shall affect one or more of the following alternatives, which may vary among individual holders and which may vary among Options or SARs (collectively  Grants ) held by any individual holder: (i) accelerate the time at which Grants then outstanding may be exercised so that such Grants may be exercised in full for a limited period of time on or before a specified date (before or after such Change in Control) fixed by the Committee, after which specified date all unexercised Grants and all rights of holders thereunder shall terminate, (ii) require the mandatory surrender to the Company by selected holders of some or all of the outstanding Grants held by such holders (irrespective of whether such Grants are then exercisable under the provisions of this Plan) as of a date, before or after such Change in Control, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Grants and pay to each holder an amount of cash (or other consideration including securities or other property) per share equal to the excess, if any, of the amount calculated in Section 9(f) (the  Change in Control Price ) of the shares subject to such Grants over the exercise price(s) under such Grants for such shares (except that to the extent the exercise price under any such Grant is equal to or exceeds the Change in Control Price, in which case no amount shall be payable with respect to such Grant), or (iii) make such adjustments to Grants then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control;   provided  ,   however  , that the Committee may determine in its sole discretion that no adjustment is necessary to Grants then outstanding;   provided  , further, however, that the right to make such adjustments shall include, but not require or be limited to, the modification of Grants such that the holder of the Grant shall be entitled to purchase or receive (in lieu of the total number of shares of Stock as to which an Option or SAR is exercisable (the  Total Shares ) or other consideration that the holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase or receive under the Grant (the  Total Consideration )), the number of shares of stock, other securities, cash or property to which the Total Consideration would have been entitled to in connection with the Change in Control (A) (in the case of Options), at an aggregate exercise price equal to the exercise price that would have been payable if the Total Shares had been purchased upon the exercise of the Grant immediately before the consummation of the Change in Control and (B) in the case of SARs, if the SARs had been exercised immediately before the occurrence of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Change in Control that constitutes an  equity restructuring  that would be subject to a compensation expense pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , or any successor accounting standard, the provisions in Section 9(b) above shall control to the extent they are in conflict with the discretionary provisions of this Section 9(e); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9(e) or in Section 9(b) above shall be construed as providing any Participant or any beneficiary of an Award any rights with respect to the  time value,   economic opportunity  or  intrinsic value  of an Award or limiting in any manner the Committee s actions that may be taken with respect to an Award as set forth in this Section 9(e) or in Section 9(b) above.   
  (f)        Change in Control Price  .  The  Change in Control Price  shall equal the amount determined in the following clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), whichever is applicable, as follows:  (i) the price per share offered to holders of Stock in any merger or consolidation, (ii) the per share Fair Market Value of the Stock immediately before the Change in Control without regard to assets sold in the Change in Control and assuming the Company has received the consideration paid for the assets in the case of a sale of the assets, (iii) the amount distributed per share of Stock in a dissolution transaction, (iv) the price per share offered to holders of Stock in any tender offer or exchange offer whereby a Change in Control takes place, or (v) if such Change in Control occurs other than pursuant to a transaction described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this Section 9(f), the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock that may otherwise be obtained with respect to such Grants or to which such Grants track, as determined by the Committee as of the date determined by the Committee to be the date of cancellation and surrender of such Grants.  In the event that the consideration offered to stockholders of the Company in any transaction described in this Section 9(f) or in Section 9(e) consists of anything other than cash, the Committee shall determine the fair cash equivalent of the portion of the consideration offered which is other than cash and such determination shall be binding on all affected Participants to the extent applicable to Awards held by such Participants. 
  (g)        Impact of Corporate Events on Awards Generally  .  In the event of a Change in Control or changes in the outstanding Stock by reason of a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange or other relevant change in capitalization occurring after the date of the grant of any Award and not otherwise provided for by this Section 9, any outstanding Awards and any Award agreements evidencing such Awards shall be subject to adjustment by the Committee at its discretion, which adjustment may, in the Committee s discretion, be described in the Award agreement and may include, but not be limited to, adjustments as to the number and price of shares of Stock or other consideration subject to such Awards, accelerated vesting (in full or in part) of such Awards, conversion of such Awards into awards denominated in the securities or other interests of any successor Person, or the cash settlement of such Awards in exchange for the cancellation thereof.  In the event of any such change in the outstanding Stock, the aggregate number of shares of Stock available under this Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive. 
  10.        General Provisions  .   
  (a)        Transferability  . 
  (i)        Permitted Transferees  .  The Committee may, in its discretion, permit a Participant to transfer all or any portion of any Award, or authorize all or a portion of an Option or SAR to be granted to an Eligible Person to be on terms which permit transfer by such Participant;   provided   that, in either case the transferee or transferees must be any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, in each case with respect to the Participant, an individual sharing the Participant s household (other than a tenant or employee of the Company), a trust in which any of the foregoing individuals have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which any of the foregoing individuals (or the Participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests (collectively,  Permitted Transferees    provided   further that, (X) there may be no consideration for any such transfer and (Y) subsequent transfers of Awards transferred as provided above shall be prohibited except subsequent transfers back to the original holder of the Awards and transfers to other Permitted Transferees of the original holder.  Agreements evidencing Awards with respect to which such transferability is authorized at the time of grant must be approved by the Committee, and must expressly provide for transferability in a manner consistent with this Section 10(a)(i). 
  (ii)        Domestic Relations Orders  .  An Award may be transferred, to a Permitted Transferee, pursuant to a domestic relations order entered or approved by a court of competent jurisdiction upon delivery to the Company of written notice of such transfer and a certified copy of such order. 
  (iii)        Other Transfers  .  Except as expressly permitted by Sections 10(a)(i) and 10(a)(ii), Awards shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10, an Incentive Stock Option shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
  (iv)        Effect of Transfer  .  Following the transfer of any Award as contemplated by Sections 10(a)(i), 10(a)(ii) and 10(a)(iii), (A) such Award shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided that the term  Participant  shall be deemed to refer to the Permitted Transferee, the recipient under a qualified domestic relations order, or the estate or heirs of a deceased Participant or other transferee, as applicable, to the extent appropriate to enable the Participant to exercise the transferred Award in accordance with the terms of this Plan and applicable law and (B) the provisions of the Award relating to exercisability shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Participant and, following the occurrence of any applicable events described therein the Awards shall be exercisable by the Permitted Transferee, the recipient under a qualified domestic relations order, or the estate or heirs of a deceased Participant, as applicable, only to the extent and for the periods that would have been applicable in the absence of the transfer. 
  (v)        Procedures and Restrictions  .  Any Participant desiring to transfer an Award as permitted under Sections 10(a)(i), 10(a)(ii) or 10(a)(iii) shall make application therefor in the manner and time specified by the Committee and shall comply with such other requirements as the Committee may require to assure compliance with all applicable securities laws.  The Committee shall not give permission for such a transfer if (A) it would give rise to short swing liability under section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or (B) it may not be made in compliance with all applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws. 
  (vi)        Registration  .  To the extent the issuance to any Permitted Transferee of any shares of Stock issuable pursuant to Awards transferred as permitted in this Section 10(b) is not registered pursuant to the effective registration statement of the Company generally covering the shares to be issued pursuant to this Plan to initial holders of Awards, the Company shall not have any obligation to register the issuance of any such shares of Stock to any such transferee. 
  (b)        Taxes  .  The Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Parents are authorized to withhold from any Award granted, or any payment relating to an Award under this Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award.  This authority shall include authority to withhold or receive Stock or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participant s tax obligations, either on a mandatory or elective basis in the discretion of the Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Affiliates may, in its sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, withhold or permit the Participant to elect to have the Company withhold a sufficient number of shares of Stock that are otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to an Award (or allow the surrender of shares of Stock by the Participant to the Company). The number of shares of Stock that may be so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of shares of Stock that have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates for U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. income and social insurance taxes and payroll taxes, as determined by the Committee. 
  (c)        Changes to this Plan and Awards  .  The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate this Plan or the Committee s authority to grant Awards under this Plan without the consent of stockholders or Participants, except that any amendment or alteration to this Plan, including any increase in any share limitation, shall be subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders not later than the annual meeting next following such Board action if such stockholder approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then be listed or quoted, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit other such changes to this Plan to stockholders for approval;   provided  , that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Board action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award agreement relating thereto, except as otherwise provided in this Plan;   provided  ,   however  , that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under such Award.  For purposes of clarity, any adjustments made to Awards pursuant to Section 9 will be deemed   not   to materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award and therefore may be made without the consent of affected Participants. 
  (d)        Limitation on Rights Conferred under Plan  .  Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant the right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in the employ or service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, (ii) interfering in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents to terminate any Eligible Person s or Participant s employment or service relationship at any time, (iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to be granted any Award under this Plan or to be treated uniformly with other Participants and/or employees and/or other service providers, or (iv) conferring on a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Participant is duly issued or transferred shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of an Award. 
  (e)        Unfunded Status of Awards  .  This Plan is intended to constitute an  unfunded  plan for certain incentive awards. 
  (f)        Nonexclusivity of this Plan  .  Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor its submission to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or a committee thereof to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including incentive arrangements and awards which do not qualify under section 162(m) of the Code.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents from taking any corporate action which is deemed by the Company or such Subsidiary or Parent to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on this Plan or any Award made under this Plan. No employee, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents as a result of any such action. 
  (g)        Fractional Shares  .  No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Award.  The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
  (h)        Severability  .  If any provision of this Plan is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.  If any of the terms or provisions of this Plan or any Award agreement conflict with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 (as those terms or provisions are applied to Eligible Persons who are subject to section 16(b) of the Exchange Act) or section 422 of the Code (with respect to Incentive Stock Options), then those conflicting terms or provisions shall be deemed inoperative to the extent they so conflict with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 (unless the Board or the Committee, as appropriate, has expressly determined that the Plan or such Award should not comply with Rule 16b-3) or section 422 of the Code.  With respect to Incentive Stock Options, if this Plan does not contain any provision required to be included herein under section 422 of the Code, that provision shall be deemed to be incorporated herein with the same force and effect as if that provision had been set out at length herein;   provided  , further, that, to the extent any Option that is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option cannot so qualify, that Option (to that extent) shall be deemed an Option not subject to section 422 of the Code for all purposes of the Plan. 
  (i)        Governing Law  .  All questions arising with respect to the provisions of the Plan and Awards shall be determined by application of the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions thereof, except to the extent Delaware law is preempted by federal law.  The obligation of the Company to sell and deliver Stock hereunder is subject to applicable federal and state laws and to the approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the authorization, issuance, sale, or delivery of such Stock. 
  (j)        Conditions to Delivery of Stock  .  Nothing herein or in any Award granted hereunder or any Award agreement shall require the Company to issue any shares with respect to any Award if that issuance would, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, constitute a violation of the Securities Act or any similar or superseding statute or statutes, any other applicable statute or regulation, or the rules of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect.  At the time of any exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or at the time of any grant of a Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, or other Award the Company may, as a condition precedent to the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right or settlement of any Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit or other Award, require from the Participant (or in the event of his or her death, his or her legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees) such written representations, if any, concerning the holder s intentions with regard to the retention or disposition of the shares of Stock being acquired pursuant to the Award and such written covenants and agreements, if any, as to the manner of disposal of such shares as, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, may be necessary to ensure that any disposition by that holder (or in the event of the holder s death, his or her legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees) will not involve a violation of the Securities Act or any similar or superseding statute or statutes, any other applicable state or federal statute or regulation, or any rule of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect.  No Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable and no settlement of any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit shall occur with respect to a Participant unless and until the holder thereof shall have paid cash or property to, or performed services for, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents that the Committee believes is equal to or greater in value than the par value of the Stock subject to such Award. 
  (k)        Clawback  .  The Committee shall have the right to provide, in an Award Agreement or otherwise, or to require a Participant to agree by separate written or electronic instrument, that all Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the Participant upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the receipt or resale of any shares of Stock underlying the Award) shall be subject to the provisions of any clawback policy implemented by the Company, including, without limitation, any clawback policy adopted to comply with the requirements of applicable law, including without limitation the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent set forth in such clawback policy and/or in the applicable Award Agreement. 
  (l)        Section 409A of the Code  .  In the event that any Award granted pursuant to this Plan provides for a deferral of compensation within the meaning of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, it is the general intention, but not the obligation, of the Company to design such Award to comply with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and such Award should be interpreted accordingly.  Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or an Award agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit provided for under an Award would be subject to additional taxes and interest under section 409A of the Code if the Participant s receipt of such payment or benefit is not delayed in accordance with the requirements of section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such payment or benefit shall not be provided to the Participant (or the Participant s estate, if applicable) until the earlier of (i) the date of the Participant s death or (ii) the date that is six months after the date of the Participant s  separation from service  with the Company within the meaning of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. 
  (m)        Plan Effective Date and Term  .  This Plan was adopted by the Board and approved by the sole stockholder of the Company on July 21, 2014, to be effective on the Effective Date.  No Awards may be granted under this Plan on and after July 21, 2024.
