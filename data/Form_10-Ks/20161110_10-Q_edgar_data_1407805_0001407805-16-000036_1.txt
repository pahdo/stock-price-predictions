Note 1 - General and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Rockies Region 2007 Limited Partnership   (this  Partnership  or the  Registrant ) was organized in 2007 as a limited partnership, in accordance with the laws of the State of West Virginia, for the purpose of engaging in the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties. Business operations commenced upon closing of an offering for the private placement of Partnership units. Upon funding, this Partnership entered into a Drilling and Operating Agreement ( D O Agreement ) with the Managing General Partner which authorizes PDC to conduct and manage this Partnership's business. In accordance with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement (the  Agreement ), the Managing General Partner is authorized to manage all activities of this Partnership and initiates and completes substantially all Partnership transactions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,758   limited partners ("Investor Partners") in this Partnership. PDC is the designated Managing General Partner of this Partnership and owns a   37%   Managing General Partner ownership in this Partnership. According to the terms of the Agreement, revenues, costs and cash distributions of this Partnership are allocated   63%   to the Investor Partners, which are shared pro rata based upon the number of units in this Partnership, and   37%   to the Managing General Partner. The Managing General Partner may repurchase Investor Partner units under certain circumstances provided by the Agreement, upon request of an individual Investor Partner. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Managing General Partner had repurchased   145   units of Partnership interest from the Investor Partners at an average price of   $2,376   per unit. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Managing General Partner owned   39%   of this Partnership, including the repurchased interest. 
    
  In the Managing General Partner's opinion, the accompanying condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of this Partnership's results for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial information included in the audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2015 condensed balance sheet data was derived from financial statements audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent  registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report filed with the SEC on March 25, 2016, but does not include disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with this Partnership's audited financial statements and notes thereto included in this Partnership's   2015   Form 10-K. This Partnership's accounting policies are described in the   Notes to Financial Statements   in this Partnership's   2015   Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,   2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards     
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The standard outlines a five-step approach to apply the underlying principle: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to the standard intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations when recognizing revenue. The revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The revenue standard can be adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition method. Entities are permitted to adopt the revenue standard early, beginning with annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016. The Managing General Partner of this Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on this Partnership's financial statements.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (unaudited) 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This Partnership expects to adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on this Partnership's financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update on statements of cash flows to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Managing General Partner of this Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on this Partnership's financial statements. 

Note 3 - Transactions with Managing General Partner 
    
  The Managing General Partner transacts business on behalf of this Partnership under the authority of the D O Agreement.  Revenues and other cash inflows received by the Managing General Partner on behalf of this Partnership are distributed to the partners, net of corresponding operating costs and other cash outflows incurred on behalf of this Partnership.  
    
  The following table presents transactions with the Managing General Partner reflected in the condensed balance sheets line item  Due to Managing General Partner-other, net,  which remain undistributed or unsettled with this Partnership's investors as of the dates indicated:

During the second quarter of 2016, an overriding royalty owner notified the Managing General Partner that the owner believed certain charges and costs had been improperly deducted before applying the owner s overriding royalty percentage in certain of this Partnership s wells in which this owner has an interest. During settlement discussions, the Managing General Partner and the owner agreed on a settlement amount. This Partnership recorded a charge to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales and an accrual of approximately   $63,000   for this settlement during the second quarter of 2016. The settlement was paid to the overriding royalty owner and deducted from this Partnership's cash distributions in the third quarter of 2016. 

Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements 
    
  This Partnership's fair value measurements were estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires this Partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The carrying value of the financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
    
  The Managing General Partner utilizes fair value, on a non-recurring basis, to perform impairment testing on this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas properties by comparing net capitalized costs, or carrying value, to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows, the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value and is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed their estimated fair value. 

Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  Neither this Partnership nor PDC, in its capacity as the Managing General Partner of this Partnership, are party to any pending legal proceeding that PDC believes would have a materially adverse effect on this Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
  Environmental 
    
  Due to the nature of the oil and gas industry, this Partnership is exposed to environmental risks. The Managing General Partner has various policies and procedures in place to prevent environmental contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental contamination. The Managing General Partner conducts periodic reviews to identify changes in this Partnership's environmental risk profile. Liabilities are accrued when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are reduced as remediation efforts are completed or are adjusted as a consequence of subsequent periodic reviews. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , this Partnership had accrued environmental remediation liabilities of   $2,900   and   $1,600  , respectively, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the condensed balance sheets. 
    
  The Managing General Partner is not currently aware of any environmental claims existing as of   September 30, 2016   which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on this Partnership's condensed financial statements; however, there can be no assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change or that unknown past non-compliance with environmental laws or other potential sources of liability will not be discovered on this Partnership's properties. 
    
  In August 2015, the Managing General Partner received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request (the "Information Request") from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). The Information Request sought, among other things, information related to the design, operation, and maintenance of certain production facilities in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of

ROCKIES REGION 2007 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (unaudited) 

Colorado. The Information Request focused on historical operation and design information for 46 production facilities, of which one relates to this Partnership, and asked that the Managing General Partner conduct sampling and analyses at the identified 46 facilities. The Managing General Partner responded to the Information Request in January 2016. The Managing General Partner continues to meet with the EPA and provide additional information, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time. 
    
  In addition, in December 2015, the Managing General Partner received a Compliance Advisory pursuant to C.R.S.   25-7-115(2) from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Quality Control Commission's Air Pollution Control Division alleging that the Managing General Partner had failed to design, operate, and maintain certain condensate collection, storage, processing and handling operations to minimize leakage of volatile organic compounds to the maximum extent possible at 65 facilities consistent with applicable standards under Colorado law. Certain of this Partnership's wells were included in this list of 65 facilities. The Managing General Partner is working with the agency to address the allegations, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time.  

Note 6 - Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of the asset retirement obligations associated with this Partnership's working interest in crude oil and natural gas properties:  

The current portion of the asset retirement obligations relates to wells that are producing minimal or no hydrocarbons and are expected to be plugged and abandoned within the next 12 months. 
    
  This Partnership's estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated economic lives, estimated plugging and abandonment costs and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the liability, this Partnership must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time, revisions to either the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows or changes in inflation factors and changes to this Partnership's credit-adjusted risk-free rate as market conditions warrant.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Partnership Overview 
    
  This Partnership engages in the development, production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. This Partnership began crude oil and natural gas operations in   August 2007   and currently operates   75   gross (  73.9   net) wells located in the Wattenberg Field of Colorado. The Managing General Partner markets this Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production to midstream marketers. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold primarily under market-sensitive contracts in which the price varies as a result of market forces. PDC does not charge a separate fee for the marketing of the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs because these services are covered by a monthly well operating charge. Seasonal factors, such as effects of weather on realized commodity prices, costs incurred and availability of PDC or third-party owned pipeline capacity, and other factors such as high line pressures in the gathering system, whether caused by heat or third-party facilities issues, may impact this Partnership's results. 
    
  Partnership Operating Results Overview 
    
  Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales decreased   $110,000  , or   9%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable period of   2015  , attributable to a decrease in the average sales price per barrel of crude oil equivalent ("Boe") of   8%   and a $63,000 provision for underpayment of natural gas sales, offset in part by an increase in sales volume of   4%  . The average sales price per Boe was   $21.98   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $23.85   for the same period a year ago. 
    
  Primarily as a result of the decreased sales revenues, this Partnership experienced decreased cash flows from operations. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , this Partnership had net cash from operations of   $234,000   compared to net cash from operations of   $335,000   for the comparable period of   2015  . Accordingly, cash distributions to Investor Partners decreased   47%   to   $216,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $410,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales 
    
  Changes in Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales Volumes.   For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production, on an energy equivalency-basis, decreased   6%  , primarily attributable to a 21% increase in average system line pressures. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production, on an energy equivalency-basis, increased   4%  , primarily attributable to a 13% reduction in average system line pressures. 
    
  Production from crude oil and natural gas wells that have been producing for longer periods of time are more susceptible to variations in line pressure. From time to time, this Partnership s production has been adversely affected by high line pressures in the Wattenberg Field. Such pressures affected this Partnership's production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as noted above. The Partnership relies on third-party midstream service providers to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with industry-wide production growth. The Managing General Partner, along with other operators in the Wattenberg Field, continues to work closely with the third-party midstream providers to monitor the need for such facilities in an effort to ensure adequate system capacity going forward. The timing and availability of adequate infrastructure, including potential line pressure impacts in 2017, is not within this Partnership s control and may be affected by a number of factors, including potential increases in production from the Wattenberg Field and warmer than expected weather. 
    
  Changes in Crude Oil Sales.   Crude oil sales increased by   $12,000  , or   1%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, primarily attributable to an increase production volume of   11%  , offset by decrease in the average selling price of   9%   per Bbl. The average selling price per Bbl was   $36.85   for the current year   nine   month period compared to   $40.49   for the same prior year period. 
    
  Crude oil sales increased by   $53,000  , or   18%  , during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, attributable to an increase in the average selling price of   18%   per Bbl. The average selling price per Bbl was   $44.04   for the current year   three   month period compared to   $37.26   for the same prior year period. 
    
  Changes in Natural Gas Sales.   Natural gas sales decreased by   $52,000  , or   25%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, due to a decrease in average selling price of   23%   per Mcf and a decrease in production volume of   3%  . The average selling price per Mcf was   $1.58   for the current year   nine   month period compared to   $2.04   for the same prior year period. 
    
  Natural gas sales decreased by   $6,000  , or   8%  , during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in production volume of   15%  , offset by an increase in average selling price of   7%   per Mcf. The average selling price per Mcf was   $2.01   for the current year   three   month period compared to   $1.87   for the same prior year period. 
    
  Changes in NGLs Sales.   NGLs sales decreased by   $7,000  , or   6%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price of   7%   per Bbl, offset in part by a production volume increase of   2%  . The average selling price per Bbl was   $8.88   for the current year   nine   month period compared to   $9.59   for the same prior year period.

NGLs sales increased by   $7,000  , or   23%  , during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of   27%   per Bbl, slightly offset by a decrease in production volume of   4%  . The average selling price per Bbl was   $9.45   for the current year   three   month period compared to   $7.43   for the same prior year period. 
    
  Provision for Underpayment of Natural Gas Sales.   During the second quarter of 2016, an overriding royalty owner notified the Managing General Partner that the owner believed certain charges and costs had been improperly deducted before applying the owner s overriding royalty percentage in certain of this Partnership s wells in which this owner has an interest. During settlement discussions, the Managing General Partner and the owner agreed on a settlement amount. In June 2016, this Partnership recorded a charge to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of approximately $63,000 for this settlement. The settlement was paid to the overriding royalty owner and deducted from this Partnership's cash distributions in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Pricing.   This Partnership's results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the Managing General Partner's ability to market this Partnership's production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. While the price of crude oil decreased during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, prices during the third quarter of 2016 increased substantially compared to the first half of 2016 as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined. Natural gas prices also decreased during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same prior year period. Due to an oversupply of nearly all domestic NGLs products, this Partnership's average realized sales price for NGLs during the first nine months of 2016 reflected the same low levels seen during the last quarter of 2015, although NGLs prices were somewhat higher in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable prior year period.  
    
  This Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are recorded under either the  net-back  or "gross" method of accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. This Partnership uses the "net-back" method of accounting for natural gas and NGLs sales, as well as a portion of this Partnership's crude oil production, as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation, gathering and processing services. This Partnership sells commodities at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price. The net-back method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based. This Partnership uses the "gross" method of accounting for crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs pipeline as the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services. Under this method, this Partnership recognizes revenues based on the gross selling price and recognizes transportation, gathering and processing expenses as a component of production costs. 

Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Production Costs 
    
  Generally, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs vary with changes in total crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales and production volumes. Production taxes are estimates by the Managing General Partner based on tax rates determined using published information. These estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the Managing General Partner with taxing authorities. Production taxes vary directly with crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales. Fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as production decreases. In addition, general oil field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on services required, but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment repairs and maintenance, snow removal, environmental compliance and remediation and service rig workovers.  
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   increased   $46,000   compared to the same period in   2015  . The period-over-period increase was primarily attributable to an increase in oil transportation cost on the White Cliffs pipeline, workover expense, production taxes and metering charges by this Partnership's midstream provider, offset in part by a decrease in well swabbing costs and wireline work, regulatory compliance expenses and other operating costs.

  Direct costs - general and administrative for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   increased approximately   $22,000   compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to higher professional fees.  
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Direct costs - general and administrative for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   increased approximately   $20,000   compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to higher professional fees.  
    
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD A") expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD A expense decreased   $297,000   during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , mainly attributable to a lower DD A expense rate in   2016  , partially offset in part by the   4%   increase in production volumes. The DD A expense rate per Boe decreased to   $5.74   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   $11.71   during the same period in   2015   due to the effect of impairments recorded in 2015 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on this Partnership's proved crude oil and natural gas properties. Partially offsetting this decrease were the decline in proved developed reserves at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, as a result of the significant decrease in SEC commodity prices utilized in the December 31, 2015 reserve report and the removal of vertical re-fracs and re-completions from the proved developed reserves, due to the current depressed commodity price environment. 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  DD A expense decreased   $109,000   during the   three months ended September 30,     2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , mainly attributable to a lower DD A expense rate in   2016   . The DD A expense rate per Boe decreased to   $5.79   for the    three months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   $11.48   during the same period in   2015   due to the effect of impairments recorded in 2015 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on this Partnership's proved crude oil and natural gas properties. Partially offsetting this decrease were the decline in proved developed reserves at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, as a result of the significant decrease in SEC commodity prices utilized in the December 31, 2015 reserve report and the removal of vertical re-fracs and re-completions from the proved developed reserves, due to the current depressed commodity price environment. 
    
  Asset Retirement Obligations and Accretion Expense 
    
  Of the   75   wells in this partnership, 33 wells had an increase in production totaling approximately 12.2 MBoe, or 23%, during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to the same prior year period and 40 wells had a decrease in production totaling approximately 9.9 MBoe, or 19%, during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to the same prior year period.  The remaining two wells did not produce hydrocarbons during either period. The Managing General Partner expects that a portion of this Partnership's wells may be uneconomical to operate and may be plugged and abandoned. Currently, the Managing General Partnership anticipates that four of this Partnership's wells will be plugged and abandoned over the next 12 months. As a result, as of   September 30, 2016  , this Partnership has classified a portion of the asset retirement obligation ("ARO") as a current liability.

Accretion of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") expense for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   increased   $38,000   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily attributable to an increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in December 2015 to reflect increased estimated costs for materials and services related to the plugging and abandonment of certain vertical wells, as well as a decrease in the estimated useful life of these wells. 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Accretion of ARO expense for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   increased   $13,000   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily attributable to an increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in December 2015 to reflect increased estimated costs for materials and services related to the plugging and abandonment of certain vertical wells, as well as a decrease in the estimated useful life of these wells. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Historically, this Partnership's primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operating activities. Fluctuations in this Partnership's operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and sales volumes. This source of cash has been primarily used to fund this Partnership's operating costs, direct costs-general and administrative, capital program and distributions to the Investor Partners and the Managing General Partner. 
    
  This Partnership's future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and revenues generated from crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production activities. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production from existing properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the remaining life of the wells. Accordingly, this Partnership anticipates a lower annual level of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production and, therefore, lower revenues, unless commodity prices increase. Under these circumstances, decreased production would have a material adverse impact on this Partnership's operations and may result in a continued reduction in or elimination of cash distributions to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners through the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
    
  Working Capital 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , this Partnership had a working capital of   $175,000  , compared to working capital of   $182,000   at   December 31, 2015  . The   $7,000   decrease in working capital from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the following changes: 

an increase in the current portion of asset retirement obligations of   $10,000  ; and 
                
    an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $3,000  . 
       
  Offset in part by: 

a decrease in amounts due to Managing General Partner-other, net of   $14,000  . 
       
  Although the D O Agreement permits this Partnership to borrow funds on its behalf for Partnership activities, the Managing General Partner does not anticipate electing to fund a portion of this Partnership's activities, if any, through borrowings. Partnership borrowings, should any occur, will be non-recourse to the Investor Partners. Accordingly, this Partnership, rather than the Investor Partners, will be responsible for repaying any amounts borrowed.

Cash Flows 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  This Partnership's cash flows from operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   were primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, operating costs and direct costs-general and administrative expenses. The key components of the changes in this Partnership's cash flows from operating activities are described in more detail in   Results of Operations   above. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $234,000   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to net cash from operating activities of   $335,000   for the comparable period in   2015  . The decrease of   $101,000   in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to the following: 

an increase in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs of   $46,000  ; and 
                
    an increase in direct costs - general and administrative of   $22,000  . 
       
  Offset in part by: 

an increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $77,000  . 
       
  Investing Activities  
    
  Cash flows from investing activities consist of investments in equipment. From time to time, this Partnership invests in equipment which supports treatment, delivery and measurement of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs or environmental protection. During the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , investment in equipment was   $46,000   compared to   $58,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  This Partnership initiated monthly cash distributions to investors in   May 2008   and has distributed   $113.6 million   through   September 30, 2016  . The table below presents cash distributions to this Partnership's investors. Distributions to the Managing General Partner represent amounts distributed to the Managing General Partner for its   37%   general partner interest in this Partnership and Investor Partner distributions include amounts distributed to Investor Partners for their   63%   ownership share in this Partnership, including amounts distributed to the Managing General Partner for limited partnership units repurchased.  

The decrease in distributions during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2016.

  I, Barton R. Brookman, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of   Rockies Region 2007 Limited Partnership  ; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
