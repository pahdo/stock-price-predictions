1.   
       Basis
    of Presentation    

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial
statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial
position as of March 31, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. The
financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to these periods are
unaudited. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for any subsequent periods or for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived
from the audited financial statements at that date.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements
and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Principles
of Consolidation    

Our
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This basis differs from that used in the statutory
accounts of SkyPeople (China), Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo, Huludao Wonder, Yingkou, Hedetang Juice Beverages, Orange Products, SkyPeople
Suizhong, Kiwi Fruit   Farm Products, Guo Wei Mei, Xi an Hedetang, Cornucopia, Fruitee Fun and Hedetang Holding, which
were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and relevant financial regulations applicable to enterprises in the
PRC. All necessary adjustments have been made to present the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Uses
of estimates in the preparation of financial statements    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The significant areas requiring
the use of management estimates include, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, estimated useful
life and residual value of property, plant and equipment, provision for staff benefit, recognition and measurement of deferred
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge
of current events and actions management may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs    

Shipping
and handling amounts billed to customers in related sales transactions are included in sales revenues and shipping expenses incurred
by the Company are reported as a component of selling expenses. The shipping and handling expenses of $92,408 and $956,653 for
the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
as a component of selling expenses.  

Leases    

Leases
are reviewed and classified as capital or operating at their inception in accordance with ASC Topic 840, Accounting for Leases.
For leases that contain rent escalations, the Company records monthly rent expense equal to the total amount of the payments due
in the reporting period over the lease term. The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged
to deferred rent account.  

Earnings
per share    

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 215,  Statement of Shareholder Equity . Basic EPS are computed by dividing net income available
to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period.
Diluted EPS give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during a period. In computing diluted EPS, the average
price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and
warrants.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
January 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to its accounting guidance related to recognition and measurement of financial assets
and financial liabilities. The amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
financial instruments. The amendment will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We are evaluating
the impact of adopting this amendment to our consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for leases. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency
and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet.
The new standard will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of
expense recognition in the statement of earnings. The new standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective method
to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. The new standard will be effective for us
beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this
amendment to our consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to its accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments. The amendment simplifies
several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The amendment will be effective
for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting
this amendment to our consolidated financial statements.  

There
were no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended March 31,
2016 compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 that are of significance or potential significance to us.

East to North America, Europe, Russia, South Korea and the Middle East.  The Company sells its Hedetang branded bottled
fruit beverages domestically primarily to supermarkets in the PRC. The Company sells its fresh fruit and vegetables to supermarkets
and whole sellers in the PRC.  

Some
of these product segments might never individually meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments and we
determine the reportable segments based on the discrete financial information provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker evaluates the results of each segment in assessing performance and allocating resources among
the segments. Since there is an overlap of services provided and products manufactured between different subsidiaries of the Company,
the Company does not allocate operating expenses and assets based on the product segments. Therefore, operating expenses and assets
information by segment are not presented. Segment profit represents the gross profit of each reportable segment.

       Subsequent
    Events    

On
June 15, 2016, Hedetang Holdings Co., Ltd. (the  Hedetang ), a wholly owned subsidiary of SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc.
(the  Company ), entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Shaanxi New Silk Road Kiwifruit
Group Inc. ( the  NSR ), a limited liability corporation registered in China.  

Pursuant to the Agreement, NSR will acquire
51% of the equity shares of Shaanxi Guoweiduomei Beverage Co, Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hedetang (the  Shares ).
The tentative total transfer price for the Shares is 300 million RMB (approximately $46 million) and is subject to and will be
settled according to the final price in the valuation report to be issued by an appraisal firm jointly engaged by both parties.
NSR shall pay the total transfer price to Hedetang within six months of the effective date of the Agreement. If NSR fails to pay
the total transfer price within six months due to the delay of the approval process from the local authority, NSR can receive a
payment extension for up to twelve months from the effective date of the Agreement upon the negotiation and agreement by the parties.
Because NSR is a state-owned enterprise in China and its investment needs to be approved by a higher level administrative authority
in China, NSR has the right to terminate the Agreement unilaterally if it fails to receive the approval from such administrative
authority within twelve months from the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this report, the local authority has not approved
this transaction, and we have not yet received payment from NSR. The Company is now negotiating with NSR the potential terms to
terminate this Agreement.

DISCLAIMER
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

The
following discussion and analysis of the condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes in Item I above and with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes, and with the information under the headings  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ
materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including
those discussed in this report and under the heading  Risk Factors  in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Overview
of Our Business   

We are engaged in the production and sales
of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees, concentrated fruit purees and concentrated fruit juices), fruit beverages
(including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages), and other fruit related products (including organic and non-organic
fresh fruits) in and out of the PRC. Our fruit juice concentrates, which include apple, pear and kiwifruit concentrates, are sold
to domestic customers and exported directly or via distributors. We sell our Hedetang branded bottled fruit beverages domestically
primarily to supermarkets in the PRC. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, sales of our fruit concentrates, fruit beverages,
fresh fruits and other fruit related products represented 100%, 0% and 0% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 40%, 60% and
0% respectively, for the same period of 2015.  

In
addition to our domestic sales, we also export our products. We sell our products either through distributors with good credit
or to end users directly. Our main export markets are Asia, North America, Europe, Russia and the Middle East. We sell our other
fruit related products to domestic customers.  

We
currently market our Hedetang brand fruit beverages in only certain regions of the PRC. We plan to expand the market presence
of Hedetang over a broader geographic area in the PRC. In particular, we plan to expand our glass bottle production line to produce
higher margin portable fruit juice beverages targeting consumers in more populated Chinese cities. Currently we produce six flavors
of fruit beverages in 280 ml glass bottles, 418 ml glass and 500 ml glass bottles and BIB packages, including apple juice, pear
juice, kiwifruit juice, mulberry juice, peach juice and pomegranate juice. We currently sell our fruit beverages to over 100 distributors
and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces. Our products are sold through distributors in stores such as
Hualian Supermarket in Beijing, RT-Mart in Shenyang, WOWO in Chengdu, Quanjia convenient store chain, Vanguard in Xi an,
Carrefour in Chongqing and Shenyang and Lianhua Supermarket in Shanghai.  

We
plan to continue to focus on creating new products with high margins to supplement our current product offering.  

Our
business is highly seasonal and can be greatly affected by weather because of the seasonal nature in the growing and harvesting
of fruits and vegetables. Our core products are apple, pear and kiwifruit juice concentrates, which are produced from July or
August to April of the following year. The squeezing season for (i) apples is from August to January or February; (ii) pears is
from July or August until April of next year; and (iii) kiwifruit is from September through December. Typically, a substantial
portion of our revenues is earned during our first and fourth quarters. To minimize the seasonality of our business, we make continued
efforts in identifying new products with harvesting seasons complementary to our current product mix. Our goal is to lengthen
our squeezing season, thus increasing our annual production of fruit juice concentrates and fruit beverages. In the first quarter
of 2009, we introduced mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages in the Chinese market. Unlike fruit juice concentrates, which can
only be produced during the squeezing season, such fruit beverages are made out of fruit juice concentrates and can be produced
and sold in all seasons. With continuous efforts in marketing of our beverages in domestic market, we believe that our seasonality
will be reduced.  

Fresh
fruits are the primary raw materials needed for the production of our products. Our raw materials mainly consist of apples, pears
and kiwifruits. Other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme, amylase, auxiliary power fuels and other power
sources such as coal, electricity and water.  

We purchase raw materials from local markets
and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants. We have implemented a fruit-purchasing program in areas surrounding our
factories. In addition, we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas, helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing
agents easily and in a timely manner. We are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production. We have assisted
local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel.
Our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile in China. Fruit concentrate and fruit
juice beverage companies generally do not enter into purchasing agreements with raw fruit suppliers. In addition to raw materials,
we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners, glass and plastic bottles, cans and packing barrels.
We generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers. We are not dependent on any one supplier or group of
suppliers.  

Shaanxi
and Liaoning Provinces, where our manufacturing facilities are located, are large fruit producing provinces. We own and operate
four manufacturing facilities in the PRC, all of which are strategically located near fruit growing centers so that we can better
preserve the freshness of the fruits and lower our transportation costs. To take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance
our production efficiency, generally, each of our manufacturing facilities has a focus on products made from one particular fruit
according to the proximity of such manufacturing to the sources of supply for that fruit. Our kiwifruit processing facilities
are located in Zhouzhi County of Shaanxi Province, which has the largest planting area of apples and kiwifruit in the PRC. Our
pear processing facilities are located in Shaanxi Province, which is the main pear-producing province in the PRC. Our apple processing
facilities are located in Liaoning Province, a region that abounds with high acidity apples. As we use the same production line
for concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice and both Shaanxi Province and Liaoning Province are rich in fresh apple
and pear production, our Liaoning facilities also produced concentrated apple juice and our Shaanxi Province facilities also produced
concentrated apple juice based on customer need. We believe that these regions provide adequate supply of raw materials for our
production needs in the foreseeable future.  

On
August 30, 2010, we closed the public offering of 5,181,285 shares of our Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share for approximately
$25.9 million. We received an aggregate of approximately $24 million as net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had spent approximately $18.6 million on various capital projects
in Huludao Wonder and $5.4 million on projects in SkyPeople Suizhong, as described in project (1) below using the proceeds from
our public offering. The following table presents the capital projects on which we currently plan to use the proceeds from this
offering. We review these projects and capital expenditures on a quarterly basis based on the market conditions and associated
costs of these projects.  

Capital
Investment Projects

The
distribution center is planned to be completed by the last quarter of 2017, and the orange plantation is planned to be operational
in the second quarter of 2017.  

Investment/Service
Agreement with Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center   

On
April 3, 2013, SkyPeople (China) entered into an Investment Agreement (the  Agreement ) with the Managing Committee
of Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center (the  Committee ). The Committee has been authorized by the
People s Government of Mei County to be in charge of the construction and administration of the Mei County National Kiwi
Fruit Wholesale Trading Center (the  Trading Center ).  

Under
the Agreement, the parties agreed to invest in and establish a kiwi fruit comprehensive deep processing zone and kiwi fruit and
fruit-related materials trading zone in Yangjia Village, Changxing Town of Mei County with a total planned area of total planned
area of 286 mu (approximately 47 acres) (the  Project ).  

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will
be responsible for the construction and financing of the Project with a total investment of RMB 445.6 million (approximately $71.9
million) in buildings and equipment. In addition, the Company agreed to pay for the land use rights for the Project land a fee
of RMB 0.3 million per mu. The Committee is responsible for financing and constructing the basic infrastructure surrounding the
Project, such as the main water supply, main water drainage, electricity, sewage, access roads to the Project, natural gas and
communications networks.  

Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading
Center built by the Company has started normal operations. There are 25 enterprises operating in the trading center, which includes
12 logistic companies, 4 on-line sales companies, 2 packing companies, and 3 agriculture companies ,
and other operations. In addition, all related government departments of National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center have moved
in. The trading center is expected to complete the promotion for the sale and lease of spaces of the trading center in the second
quarter of 2017. The Company is expected to generate income from this trading center in various operations and maximize the Company s
profit in agriculture trading area.  

On April 19, 2013, we established Shaanxi
Guo Wei Mei Kiwi Deep Processing Co., Ltd. ( Guo Wei Mei ) as a part of National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center
to engage in the business of producing kiwi fruit juice, kiwi puree and cider beverages, and similar products. The total estimated
investment was RMB 294 million (approximately $ 46
million). We are now building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R D center and
an office building. We plan to compete the construction in the second quarter of 2017.  

Suizhong

in the concentrated fruit juice business in China, the construction work on this project is currently suspended.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of Three Months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:    

Revenue    

The
following table presents our consolidated revenues for each of our main products for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively (in thousands for the revenue):  

The
decrease in gross revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily due to decreased sales in most of our product
lines that was partially offset by increased revenues from concentrated apple juice and apple aroma.  

Sales from apple-related products increased for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as
the Company sold approximately 4,796 tons of concentrated apple juice versus 211 tons of concentrated apple juice in the same
period of 2015. Such an increase was partially offset by a decrease in unit price of concentrated apple juice. Most of our concentrated
apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market. In 2016, international demand of concentrated apple juice
from China continued to drop. According to the data provided by the Chinese Customs, the amount of exported concentrated apple
juice from China dropped by 11% in the first half year of 2016 as compared to the same period of last year. Over the past three
years, the purchase price of fresh apple has increased, but the sales price of concentrated apple related products was low in
2016. Because of the negative trend of the international market and estimated lower margin, our YingKou factory did not operate
its concentrated apple juice production facilities in 2016, which caused a lower inventory of concentrated apple juice. 

During the first quarter of 2016, due to increased demand for concentrated apple juice from our customers,
we purchased the concentrated apple juice from our suppliers and sold such concentrated apple juice to our customers  to
satisfy our customers  need. We do not expect a continued increase in customers  order for concentrated apple juice
in near future.   

Sales
from concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree decreased during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to net sales of kiwi-related
product line in the same quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of the decreased amount of products sold in the first quarter
of 2016 as compare to same period of 2015. Our production of concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree in the first quarter
of 2016 was low as the demand for our products decreased in the market and our factories were closed in observance of the Spring
Festival holidays in China.  

Sales
of concentrated pear juice decreased in the first quarter of 2016 as we sold 199 and 1,519 tons of concentrated pear juice during
first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in sales amount was mainly due to short of inventory of concentrated
pear juice. Due to unexpected weather conditions in the 2015 pear harvest season, the amount of available raw material supplies
was low in early 2016. As a result, the squeezing season started later than usual, and the production amount was lower.  

Sales from our fruit juice beverages decreased
for the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to due to a decrease in the in-store demand of our products as a result of heavy
competition in China market, as consumers increased their fruit juice beverage purchases through on-line home delivery of groceries
instead of through the traditional in-store supermarkets in which we sell our products.  

Gross
Margin   

The
following table presents the consolidated gross profit of each of our main products and the consolidated gross profit margin,
which is gross profit as a percentage of the related revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively
(in thousands for the gross profit):  

The
consolidated gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $0.43 million, a decrease of $7.1 million, from 7.2 million
for the same period of 2015, primarily due to a decrease of profit margin of all of our products.  

The gross profit margin of concentrated apple juice for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 were 1% and 32%,
respectively. We did not have any inventory of concentrated apple juice during the first quarter of 2016 and we had to purchase
concentrated apple juice to satisfy our customers  demand, which caused a lower margin. 

The gross profit margin of the concentrated
kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree decreased from 36% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 to negative 48% for the same period
of 2016, primarily due to lower production during the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a higher ratio of fixed expenses
to the unit cost of our products. In addition, due to the higher cost of fresh kiwi purchased in the last squeezing season, we
experienced a higher cost of concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree sold during the current period as compared to the
same period of 2015. We also reduced the sales prices of our products as a result of lower market demand. 

The gross profit margin of the concentrated
pear juice decreased from 40% to 2% for first quarter of 2015 to 2016, respectively, primarily due to the higher costs of raw material.  

The gross profit margin of our fruit juice beverages
decreased from 46% for the three months ended March 31, 2015, to 26% for the same period of 2016. The decrease of gross margin
of fruit juice beverages was primarily due to lower unit selling prices in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to same period
of 2015 as a result of heavy market competition. 

Operating
Expenses    

The
following table presents our consolidated operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

Operating
expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015.  

The
decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared with same period of 2015,
was mainly due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts. We recorded provision of doubtful accounts of $1,452,096
in the first quarter of 2015. In April 2015, the Company recruited new employees to strengthen it sales team and replace certain
sales employees. As a result, the collection of accounts receivable were slower than expected. The Company has provided an allowance
covering 50% of the accounts receivable which were outstanding for 120 or more days, reflecting management s best estimate
of ultimate collectability of such accounts receivable. In addition, we reduced our headcount from 250 full-time employees as
of December 31, 2015 to 180 employees as of March 31, 2016 as a result of less production and competitive market condition in
China. Salary and related expenses were reduced in the first quarter of 2016.  

Selling
expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to a decrease
in shipping and handling expenses as a result of a decrease in volume of sales.  

Other
Income (Expense), Net    

Other income, net was $444,645 for three months
ended March 31, 2016 and other expenses, net were $876,756 for three months ended March 31, 2015. Subsidy income increased from
$188,761 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $ 531,445 in the same period of 2016. Subsidy income in the first quarter
of 2016 was related to our Yidu project and subsidy income in the first quarter of 2015 represents the value-added tax rebates
provided on our exports. 

Interest expense decreased to $208,665, representing a decrease of $890,405 or 81%, during the
current period as compared to interest expense of $1,099,070 for the same period of 2015, which was primarily due to lower bank
loan amounts and interest rates on our bank loans in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. During
the first quarter of 2016, China reduced the basic bank rate to stimulate the economy. Consulting fees related to a capital lease
were $9,159 in the first quarter of 2016 and there was no such expense in the first quarter of 2015. 

Income
Tax    

We
did not have tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as the company suffered a loss in the first quarter of 2016.
Our consolidated income tax rates were 26% for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  

Noncontrolling
Interests    

As
of March 31, 2016, SkyPeople (China) held a 91.15% interest in Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo and Pacific held a 99.78% interest in SkyPeople
(China). TSD held a 26.36% interest in Skypeople China. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased mainly due
to the decrease in the net income generated from Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo and SkyPeople (China).  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash of $66,251,577, an increase of $13,164,707, or 26%, from $53,086,870 as of December 31, 2015. We expect the
projected cash flows from operations, anticipated cash receipts, cash on hand, and trade credit to provide sufficient capital to
meet our projected operating cash requirements at least for the next 12 months, which does not take into account any potential
expenditures related to the potential expansion of our current production capacity. 

Our working capital has historically been generated from our operating cash flows, advances from our customers
and loans from bank facilities. Our working capital was $50,984,228 as of March 31, 2016, an increase of $228,118, from working
capital of $14,324,493 as of March 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, net cash provided by our operating activities was
$407,730 compared to $8,149,084 from operating activities of same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in net income of $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of last year. In addition, there
was cash outflow of $1,852,548 from a decrease in accounts receivable during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $12,389,382
in net cash inflow during the first quarter of 2015.  This
increase in cash outflow was partially offset by an increase in cash inflow from changes of accounts payables during the first
quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of last year.   

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, our investing activities used net cash of $2,784,612, including $2,527,423 of additions
to property, plant and equipment as compare to $1,984,556 for the same period of 2015.   

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, our financing activities generated net cash inflow of $4,016,159 as compared to net cash
inflow of $8,080,186 in the same period of 2015.  

During
the first quarter of 2016, the Company repaid $1,233,968 on bank loans as compared to repayment of $9,213,508 for the same period
of last year. In addition, the Company repaid capital lease of $11,391,267 as compared to $39,212 for the same period of last
year.  

On
March 11, 2016, Skypeople HK, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and a 99.78% owner of Skypeople China entered into a Share
Transfer Agreement and a Capital Contribution (the  Agreements ) with Shenzhen TianShunDa Equity Investment Fund Management
Co., Ltd. (the  TSD ), a limited liability corporation registered in China. Pursuant to the Agreements, TSD paid $16,641,394
and acquired 112,809,100 shares of Skypeople China from Skypeople HK, resulting in TSD owning 112,809,100 shares, or 26.36%, of
Skypeople China.  

Off-balance

As
of March 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are
required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of March 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date as identified in our internal
control over financial reporting below. 

 Notwithstanding
this material weakness, our management has concluded that, based upon the interim remediation of internal control described below
under  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting , our consolidated financial statements for the periods
covered by and included in this report are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects,
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein. 

  Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting  

Our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based upon the updated framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in 1992 and updated in May 2013. Based
on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of March 31, 2016, there is a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting. Specifically, we currently lack sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience
and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

 We have
taken, and are taking, certain actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We have
hired an assistant to the Interim Chief Financial Officer in September 2016 who has an accounting degree from the U.S. and is familiar
with U.S. GAAP to help us in preparation of our financial statements to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. We plan to hire additional credentialed professional staff and consulting professionals with greater knowledge
and experience of U.S. GAAP and related regulatory requirements to oversee our financial reporting process in order to ensure our
compliance with U.S. GAAP and other relevant securities laws. In addition to the above stated remediation plan we previously engaged
an outside Sarbanes-Oxley Act consultant in March 2012 to assist us with improving the design and operations of our internal controls
over financial reporting for our U.S. parent company and all subsidiaries. 

 We believe
the measures described above will remediate the material weakness identified above. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve
our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures are necessary to address control any future
deficiencies. 

 Other than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended March 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
    1.   
       Legal
    Proceedings    

In
April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch ( Cinda Shaanxi Branch ) filed two enforcement proceedings
with Xi'an Intermediate People's Court against the Company for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by the Company to its suppliers
for a total amount of RMB 39,596,250, or approximately $6.1 million.  

In
June 2014, two long term suppliers of pear, mulberry, kiwi fruits to the Company requested the Company to provide guarantees for
their loans with Cinda Shaanxi Branch. Considering the long term business relationship and to ensure the timely supply of raw
materials, the Company agreed to provide guarantees upon the value of the raw materials supplied to the Company. Because Cinda
Shaanxi Branch is not a bank authorized to provide loans, it eventually provided financing to the two suppliers through purchase
of accounts receivables of the two suppliers with the Company. In July, 2014, the parties entered into two agreements - Accounts
Receivables Purchase and Debt Restructure Agreement and Guarantee Agreements for Accounts Receivables Purchase and Debt Restructure.
Pursuant to the agreements, Cinda Shaanxi Branch agreed to provide a RMB 100 million credit line on a rolling basis to the two
suppliers and the Company agreed to pay its accounts payables to the two suppliers directly to Cinda Shaanxi Branch and provided
guarantees for the two suppliers. In April 2015, Cinda Shaanxi Branch stopped providing financing to the two suppliers and the
two suppliers were unable to continue the supply of raw materials to the Company. Consequently, the Company stopped making any
payment to Cinda Shaanxi Branch.  

The Company has responded to the court and
taken the position that the financings under the agreements are essentially the loans from Cinda Shaanxi Branch to the two suppliers,
and because Cinda Shaanxi Branch does not have permits to make loans in China, the agreements are invalid, void and have no legal
forces from the beginning. Therefore, the Company has no obligations to repayment the debts owed by the two suppliers to Cinda
Shaanxi Branch. The proceeding is currently pending for the verdict of the judge. 

From
time to time we may be a party to various litigation proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, none of which,
in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
