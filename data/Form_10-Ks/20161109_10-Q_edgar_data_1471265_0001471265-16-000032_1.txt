NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Unaudited 

(1) 
    Basis of Presentation and Informational Disclosures 
       
  Northwest Bancshares, Inc. (the  Company ) or ( NWBI ), a Maryland corporation headquartered in Warren, Pennsylvania, is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The primary activity of the Company is the ownership of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Northwest Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank ( Northwest ).  Northwest is regulated by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. Northwest operates   176   community-banking offices throughout Pennsylvania, western New York, eastern Ohio and Maryland. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Northwest, and Northwest s subsidiaries Northwest Settlement Agency, LLC, Northwest Consumer Discount Company, Northwest Financial Services, Inc., Northwest Advisors, Inc., Northwest Capital Group, Inc., Allegheny Services, Inc., Great Northwest Corporation, Boetger   Associates, Inc. and The Bert Company. The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information or footnotes required for complete annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations have been included.  The consolidated statements have been prepared using the accounting policies described in the financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   updated, as required, for any new pronouncements or changes. 
    
  Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year s reporting format. 
    
   The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  , or any other period. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  On May 18, 2016, we awarded employees   660,600   stock options and directors   64,800   stock options with an exercise price of   $14.15   and grant date fair value of   $1.52   per stock option.  On May 18, 2016, we also awarded employees   310,160   restricted common shares and directors   24,300   restricted common shares with a grant date fair value of   $14.51  .  Awarded stock options and common shares vest over a   ten  -year period with the first vesting occurring on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense of   $6.4 million   and   $1.0 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $9.6 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, was recognized in compensation expense relating to our stock benefit plans.  At   September 30, 2016   there was compensation expense of   $4.3 million   to be recognized for awarded but unvested stock options and   $16.2 million   for unvested common shares. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Northwest Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") was terminated. As a result,   1,366,574   unallocated ESOP shares were retired to payoff the ESOP loan due to the Company. The remaining   401,356   unallocated ESOP shares were distributed into the employees' Northwest Savings Bank 401(k) Plan accounts. This distribution resulted in stock-based compensation expense of   $5.5 million   and $  6.3 million   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
    
  Income Taxes- Uncertain Tax Positions 
    
  Accounting standards prescribe a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.  A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is  more likely than not  that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.  The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.  At   September 30, 2016   we had   no   liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  We recognize interest accrued related to: (1) unrecognized tax benefits in other expenses and (2) refund claims in other operating income.  We recognize penalties (if any) in other expenses. We are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and any state in which we conduct business for the tax periods ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  .

Impact of New Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-9,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .   This guidance supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of this guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and provides five steps to be analyzed to accomplish the core principle. This guidance is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years and early adoption is not permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)   . This guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Additionally, this guidance requires entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-2,    Leases   . This guidance requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the term of the lease. Optional periods should only be recognized if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the lessee is permitted not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal Versus Agent Considerations   . This guidance clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations of ASU 2014-09   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"  . When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party. This guidance is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years and early adoption is not permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting   . This guidance is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative and simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold for credit losses requiring, instead, that all financial assets (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected inclusive of the entity s current estimate of all lifetime expected credit losses. This guidance also applies to certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures such as unfunded commitments and non-derivative financial guarantees. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) in order to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The income statement under this guidance will reflect the initial recognition of current expected credit losses for newly recognized assets, as well as any increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have occurred during the period. This guidance retains many currently-existing disclosures related to the credit quality of an entity s assets and the related allowance for credit losses amended to reflect the change to an expected credit loss methodology,  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

as well as enhanced disclosures to provide information to users at a more disaggregated level. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-13 provides for a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is effective, except for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has previously been recognized. For these debt securities, a prospective transition is provided in order to maintain the same amortized cost prior to and subsequent to the effective date of the ASU. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position.

    Acquisition 
           
  On September 9, 2016, Northwest, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of   18   branches located in Erie and Niagara Counties, New York and certain related assets, and the assumption by Northwest of certain related liabilities, pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement with KeyCorp, First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. ( FNFG ), and First Niagara Financial Group s wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Niagara Bank, National Association ( First Niagara Bank ) and First Niagara Securities, Inc., dated April 28, 2016 (the  Purchase Agreement ). We also acquired certain wealth management relationships, which included approximately   $450.0 million   of assets under management. While the FNFG branch acquisition is considered a purchase of a business for accounting purposes, pro forma income statement information is not presented because the FNFG branch acquisition does not represent the acquisition of a business which has continuity both before and after the acquisition. 
    
  The following table shows the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed that were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition (in thousands):  

(1) Preliminary estimates of fair value have been recorded. 
  (2) Amount is net of $  76.6 million   deposit premium paid to FNFG. 
    
  We estimated the fair value of loans acquired from FNFG by utilizing a methodology wherein similar loans were aggregated into pools. Cash flows for each pool were determined by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value based on a market rate for similar loans. There was no carryover of FNFG s allowance for loan losses associated with the loans we acquired as the loans were initially recorded at fair value. We did not acquire any purchased credit impaired loans which would require accounting under ASC 310-30. 
    
  The $  25.7 million   core deposit and the $  1.1 million   wealth management intangible assets recognized as part of the FNFG acquisition are being amortized over their estimated useful life of approximately   11   and   7   years, respectively, using an accelerated method. The goodwill, which is not amortized for book purposes, was assigned to our Community Banking segment and is deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of savings and transaction deposit accounts acquired from FNFG was assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. Certificates of deposit were valued by projecting out the expected cash flows based on the remaining contractual terms of the certificate of deposit. These cash flows were discounted based on a market rate for a certificate of deposit with a corresponding remaining maturity. 
    
  Direct costs related to the FNFG acquisition were expensed as incurred and amounted to $  8.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which includes technology and communications costs, professional services, marketing and advertising, and other noninterest expenses.

    Business Segments 
       
  We operate in   two   reportable business segments: Community Banking and Consumer Finance.  The Community Banking segment provides services traditionally offered by full-service community banks, including business and personal deposit accounts and business and personal loans, as well as insurance, brokerage and investment management and trust services.  The Consumer Finance segment, which is comprised of Northwest Consumer Discount Company, a subsidiary of Northwest, operates   51   offices in Pennsylvania and offers personal installment loans for a variety of consumer and real estate products.  This activity is funded primarily through an intercompany borrowing relationship with Allegheny Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Northwest.  Net income is the primary measure used by management to measure segment performance.  The following tables provide financial information for these reportable segments.  The  All Other  column represents the parent company and elimination entries necessary to reconcile to the consolidated amounts presented in the financial statements.

We review our investment portfolio for indications of impairment.  This review includes analyzing the length of time and the extent to which amortized costs have exceeded fair values, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, and the intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value.  Certain investments are evaluated using our best estimate of future cash flows.

At   September 30, 2016  , we expect to fully collect the carrying value of our purchased credit impaired loans and have determined that we can reasonably estimate their future cash flows including those loans that are 90 days or more delinquent.  As a result, we do not consider our purchased credit impaired loans that are 90 days or more delinquent to be nonaccrual or impaired and continue to recognize interest income on these loans, including the loans  accretable discount.

Our loan portfolios include loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"), where concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include: extending the note s maturity date, permitting interest only payments, reducing the interest rate to a rate lower than current market rates for new debt with similar risk, reducing the principal payment, principal forbearance or other actions.  These concessions are applicable to all loan segments and classes. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may be returned to performing status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period of at least six months. 

25 

     Table of Contents  

When we modify loans in a TDR, we evaluate any possible impairment similar to other impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, the loan s observable market price or the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral dependent loans.  If we determine that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance.  In periods subsequent to modification, we evaluate all TDRs, including those that have payment defaults, for possible impairment, using ASC 310-10. As a result, loans modified in a TDR may have the financial effect of increasing the specific allowance associated with the loan. 
    
  Loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default.  If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, we evaluate the loan for possible further impairment. The allowance may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan, or the loan may be charged-off completely.

  Credit quality indicators  :    We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans by credit risk.  Credit relationships greater than or equal to   $1.0 million   classified as special mention or substandard are reviewed quarterly for deterioration or improvement to determine if the loan is appropriately classified.  We use the following definitions for risk ratings other than pass: 
    
  Special mention     Loans designated as special mention have specific, well-defined risk issues, which create a high level of uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of the business. Loans in this class are considered to have high-risk characteristics.  A special mention loan exhibits material negative financial trends due to company-specific or systemic conditions.  If these potential weaknesses are not mitigated, they threaten the borrower s capacity to meet its debt obligations.  Special mention loans still demonstrate sufficient financial flexibility to react to and positively address the root cause of the adverse financial trends without significant deviations from their current business strategy. Their potential weaknesses deserve our close attention and warrant enhanced monitoring. 
    
  Substandard     Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
    
  Doubtful     Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard.   In addition, those weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.   A loan classified as doubtful exhibits discernible loss potential, but a complete loss seems very unlikely.  The possibility of a loss on a doubtful loan is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may strengthen the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status can be determined. 
    
  Loss       Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such value that the continuance as a loan is not warranted.  A loss classification does not mean that the loan has no recovery or salvage value; instead, it means that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off all or a portion of a basically worthless loan even though partial recovery may be possible in the future.

    Guarantees 
       
  We issue standby letters of credit in the normal course of business.  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party.  We are required to perform under a standby letter of credit when drawn upon by the guaranteed third party in the case of nonperformance by our customer.  The credit risk associated with standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is subject to normal loan underwriting procedures.  Collateral may be obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer.  At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was   $33.7 million  , of which   $24.8 million   is fully collateralized.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a liability, which represents deferred income, of   $225,000   related to the standby letters of credit.  There are   no   recourse provisions that would enable us to recover any amounts from third parties.

    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without considering any dilutive items. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. All stock options outstanding during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise price was less than the average market price of the common shares of   $15.19  . Stock options to purchase   534,482   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $13.15   per share were outstanding during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares of   $12.76  .

    Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
       
  Fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition, is required to be disclosed. These requirements exclude certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and certain financial assets and liabilities on a non-recurring basis are accounted for using a three-level hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.  This hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices with readily available independent data in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable market inputs (Level 3).  When various inputs for measurement fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest level input that has a significant impact on fair value measurement is used. 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuation techniques: 

Level 1   Financial assets and liabilities for which inputs are observable and are obtained from reliable quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in actively traded markets.  This is the most reliable fair value measurement and includes, for example, active exchange-traded equity securities. 
                
    Level 2   Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which values are based on similar assets or liabilities that are actively traded.  Level 2 also includes pricing models in which the inputs are corroborated by market data, for example, matrix pricing. 
                
    Level 3   Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  Level 3 inputs include the following: 

Quotes from brokers or other external sources that are not considered binding; 
                
    Quotes from brokers or other external sources where it cannot be determined that market participants would in fact transact for the asset or liability at the quoted price; 
                
    Quotes and other information from brokers or other external sources where the inputs are not deemed observable. 
       
  We are responsible for the valuation process and as part of this process may use data from outside sources in establishing fair value.  We perform due diligence to understand the inputs used or how the data was calculated or derived.  We also corroborate the reasonableness of external inputs in the valuation process. 
    
  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition approximate fair value for the following financial instruments: cash on hand, interest-earning deposits in other institutions, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, accrued interest receivable, accrued interest payable, and marketable securities available-for-sale. 
    
  Marketable Securities 
    
  Where available, market values are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. 
    
  Debt securities - available for sale   - Generally, debt securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs.  The valuation for most debt securities is classified as Level 2.  Securities within Level 2 include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities and US government obligations.  Certain corporate debt securities do not have an active market and as such the broker pricing received uses alternative methods. The fair value of these corporate debt securities is determined by using a discounted cash flow model using market assumptions, which generally include cash flow, collateral and other market assumptions.  As such, these securities are included herein as Level 3 assets. 
    
  Equity securities - available for sale   - Level 1 securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices.  We consider the financial condition of the issuer to determine if the securities have indicators of impairment. 

39 

     Table of Contents  

Debt securities - held to maturity     -   The fair value of debt securities held to maturity is determined in the same manner as debt securities available for sale. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale    
    
    The estimated fair value of loans held for sale is based on market bids obtained from potential buyers. 
       
  Loans Held for Investment    
    Loans with comparable characteristics including collateral and re-pricing structures are segregated for valuation purposes. Characteristics include remaining term, coupon interest, and estimated prepayment speeds. Delinquent loans are separately evaluated given the impact delinquency has on the projected future cash flow of the loan and the approximate discount or market rate.  Each loan pool is separately valued utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. Projected monthly cash flows are discounted to present value using a market rate for comparable loans, which is not considered an exit price. 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) Stock 
    
  Due to the restrictions placed on the transferability of FHLB stock it is not practical to determine the fair value. 
    
  Deposit Liabilities 
    
  The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, which includes demand deposits, money market, and other savings accounts, is the amount payable on demand. Although market premiums paid for depository institutions reflect an additional value for these low-cost deposits, adjusting fair value for any value expected to be derived from retaining those deposits for a future period of time or from the benefit that results from the ability to fund interest-earning assets with these deposit liabilities is prohibited. The fair value estimates of deposit liabilities do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by these deposits compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market. Fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies contractual cost currently being offered in the existing portfolio to current market rates being offered locally for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The valuation adjustment for the portfolio consists of the present value of the difference of these two cash flows, discounted at the assumed market rate of the corresponding maturity. 
    
  Borrowed Funds 
    
  Fixed rate advances are valued by comparing their contractual cost to the prevailing market cost.  The carrying amount of collateralized borrowings approximates the fair value. 
    
  Junior Subordinated Debentures 
    
  The fair value of junior subordinated debentures is calculated using the discounted cash flows at the prevailing rate of interest. 
    
  Cash flow hedges   Interest rate swap agreements ( swaps ) 
    
  The fair value of the swaps is the amount we would expect to pay to terminate the agreements and is based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows using the LIBOR swap curve, the basis for the underlying interest rate. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
    
  These financial instruments generally are not sold or traded, and estimated fair values are not readily available. However, the fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. Commitments to extend credit are generally short-term in nature and, if drawn upon, are issued under current market terms. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   significant unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these financial instruments.

Fair value estimates are made at a point-in-time, based on relevant market data and information about the instrument. The methods and assumptions detailed above were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  There were   no   transfers of financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as loans measured for impairment, mortgage servicing rights, and real estate owned.  The following table represents the fair value measurement for nonrecurring assets at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as loans measured for impairment and real estate owned.  The following table represents the fair value measurement for nonrecurring assets at   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

Impaired loans     A loan is considered to be impaired as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We classify loans individually evaluated for impairment that require a specific reserve as nonrecurring Level 3. 
    
  Mortgage servicing rights   - Mortgage servicing rights represent the value of servicing residential mortgage loans, when the mortgage loans have been sold into the secondary market and the associated servicing has been retained.  The value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency rate assumptions as inputs.  All of these assumptions require a significant degree of management judgment.  Servicing rights and the related mortgage loans are segregated into categories or homogeneous pools based upon common characteristics.  Adjustments are only made when the estimated discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, as determined by individual pool.  As such, mortgage servicing rights are classified as nonrecurring Level 3. 
    
  Real Estate Owned     Real estate owned is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure or voluntarily conveyed by delinquent borrowers.  These assets are recorded on the date acquired at the lower of the related loan balance or fair value, less estimated disposition costs, with the fair value being determined by appraisal.  Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or fair value, less estimated disposition costs.  We classify all real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 3.

The table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis and for which we have utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value at   September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands):  

(1) 
    Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which may include level 3 inputs that are not identifiable, or by using the discounted cash flow method if the loan is not collateral dependent. 
       
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our debt securities are discount margins, default rates and prepayment speeds.  Significant increases in any of those rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.

    Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in the Company s Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (Trust Preferred Securities) and Interest Rate Swaps 
       
  We have   two   legacy statutory business trusts: Northwest Bancorp Capital Trust III, a Delaware statutory business trust and Northwest Bancorp Statutory Trust IV, a Connecticut statutory business trust ( Trusts ).  These trusts exist solely to issue preferred securities to third parties for cash, issue common securities to the Company in exchange for capitalization of the Trusts, invest the proceeds from the sale of the trust securities in an equivalent amount of debentures of the Company, and engage in other activities that are incidental to those previously listed. 
    
  Northwest Bancorp Capital Trust III (Trust III) issued   50,000   cumulative trust preferred securities in a private transaction to a pooled investment vehicle on December 5, 2006 (liquidation value of   $1,000   per preferred security or   $50,000,000  ) with a stated maturity of December 30, 2035.  These securities carry a floating interest rate, which is reset quarterly, equal to   three-month LIBOR   plus   1.38%  .  Northwest Bancorp Statutory Trust IV (Trust IV) issued   50,000   cumulative trust preferred securities in a private transaction to a pooled investment vehicle on December 15, 2006 (liquidation value of   $1,000   per preferred security or   $50,000,000  ) with a stated maturity of December 15, 2035.  These securities carry a floating interest rate, which is reset quarterly, equal to   three-month LIBOR   plus   1.38%  .  The Trusts have invested the proceeds of the offerings in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Company.  The structure of these debentures mirrors the structure of the trust-preferred securities. Trust III holds   $51,547,000   of the Company s junior subordinated debentures and Trust IV holds   $51,547,000   of the Company s junior subordinated debentures. These subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. Cash distributions on the trust securities are made on a quarterly basis to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the Trusts.  We have the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time, or from time-to-time, for periods not exceeding   five   years.  If interest payments on the subordinated debentures are deferred, the distributions on the trust preferred securities are also deferred.  Interest on the subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust securities is cumulative.  To date, there have been   no   interest deferrals.  Our obligation constitutes a full, irrevocable, and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis of the obligations of the trust under the preferred securities. 
    
  As a result of the LNB acquisition we acquired   two   statutory business trusts: LNB Trust I and LNB Trust II; both are Delaware statutory business trusts.  The outstanding stock issued by LNB Trust I was redeemed on December 15, 2015. At   September 30, 2016  , LNB Trust II had   7,875   cumulative trust preferred securities outstanding (liquidation value of   $1,000   per preferred security or   $7,875,000  ) with a stated maturity of June 15, 2037. These securities carry a fixed interest rate of   6.64%    
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

through June 15, 2017, then becomes a floating interest rate, which is reset quarterly, equal to   three-month LIBOR   plus   1.48%  .  LNB Trust II invested the proceeds of the offerings in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures acquired by the Company.  The structure of these debentures mirrors the structure of the trust-preferred securities. LNB Trust II holds   $8,119,000   of junior subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. Cash distributions on the trust securities are made on a quarterly basis to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the Trusts. 
    
  We are currently a counterparty to   two   interest rate swap agreements (swaps), designating the swaps as cash flow hedges.  The swaps are intended to protect against the variability of cash flows associated with Trust III and Trust IV.  The first swap modifies the re-pricing characteristics of Trust III, wherein for a   ten   year period expiring in September 2018, the Company receives interest of   three-month LIBOR   from a counterparty and pays a fixed rate of   4.61%   to the same counterparty calculated on a notional amount of $  25.0 million  .  The other swap modifies the re-pricing characteristics of Trust IV, wherein for a   ten   year period expiring in December 2018, the Company receives interest of   three-month LIBOR   from a counterparty and pays a fixed rate of   4.09%   to the same counterparty calculated on a notional amount of   $25.0 million  .  The swap agreements were entered into with a counterparty that met our credit standards and the agreements contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party.  We believe that the credit risk inherent in the contracts is not significant.  At   September 30, 2016  , $  4.2 million   of cash was pledged as collateral to the counterparty. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the swap agreements was   $(3.5) million   and was the amount we would have expected to pay if the contracts were terminated.  There was   no   material hedge ineffectiveness for these swaps. 
    
  The following table shows liability derivatives, included in other liabilities, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

We establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  As of   September 30, 2016   we have not accrued for any legal proceedings based on our analysis of currently available information which is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.  Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances.  Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings.

  Overview of Critical Accounting Policies Involving Estimates 
    
  Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Executive Summary and Comparison of Financial Condition 
    
  On September 9, 2016, we acquired 18 Western New York banking branches with deposits of $1.643 billion, at fair value, from First Niagara Bank N.A. ("FNFG"). The premium paid on the deposits was 4.5%. In addition we received $1.119 billion in cash from the transaction and $455.9 million, at fair value, of performing business and personal loans.  
    
  Total assets at   September 30, 2016   were $9.715 billion, an increase of $762.7 million, or 8.5%, from $8.952 billion at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase in assets was due primarily to the FNFG branch acquisition and organic loan growth of $120.6 million, or 1.7%. Partially offsetting these increases was the utilization of cash to payoff FHLB advances and, as a  result, borrowed funds decreased by $839.1 million, or 86.1%.  
    
  Total loans receivable increased by $576.4 million, or 8.0%, to $7.799 billion at   September 30, 2016  , from $7.222 billion at   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the FNFG branch acquisition which added loans, at fair value, totaling $455.9 million. Additionally, loans funded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , of $2.139 billion exceeded loan maturities, principal repayments of $1.850 billion and mortgage loan sales of $158.1 million. Our commercial banking loan portfolio increased by $228.1 million, or 8.2%, to $3.002 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $2.774 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of acquired loans our commercial banking portfolio increased by $122.4, or 4.4%, as we continue to emphasize the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans. Additionally, our personal banking loan portfolio increased by $348.3 million, or 7.8%, to $4.797 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $4.448 billion at   December 31, 2015  .  Net of acquired loans our personal banking loan portfolio decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.1%, due primarily to the resumption of the sale of residential mortgage loans during 2016.  
    
  Total deposits increased by $1.590 billion, or 24.0%, to $8.203 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $6.613 billion at   December 31, 2015  .  All deposit types increased with the exception of time deposits. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by $319.3 million, or 27.1%, to $1.497 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $1.177 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of assumed deposits, noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by $39.6 million, or 3.4%. Interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $366.9 million, or 34.0%, to $1.447 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $1.080 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of assumed

deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $41.2 million, or 3.8%. Savings deposits increased by $285.5 million, or 20.6%, to $1.672 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $1.386 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of assumed deposits, savings deposits increased by $43.0 million, or 3.1%. Money market demand accounts increased by $621.8 million, or 48.8%, to $1.896 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $1.275 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of assumed deposits, money market demand accounts increased by $4.6 million, or 0.4%. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in time deposits of $3.3 million, or 0.2%, to $1.691 billion at   September 30, 2016   from $1.695 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Net of assumed deposits, time deposits decreased by $181.1 million, 10.7%. We believe the increase in more liquid deposit accounts is due primarily to customers  continued reluctance to lock in time deposits at these historically low rates and our emphasis on attracting low-cost fee-based deposits. 
    
  Borrowed funds decreased by $839.1 million, or 86.1%, to $135.9 million at   September 30, 2016  , from $975.0 million at   December 31, 2015  . This decrease is due to the repayment or maturity of all FHLB borrowings with the cash received from the FNFG branch acquisition. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $17.2 million in collateralized borrowings. 
    
  Total shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was $1.163 billion, or $11.48 per share, a decrease of $360,000 from $1.163 billion, or $11.42 per share, at   December 31, 2015  .  This decrease in equity was primarily the result of the payment of cash dividends of $45.0 million, and the repurchase of 145,900 shares of common stock for $1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases were net income of $25.2 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4.9 million due to an improvement in the net unrealized gain of the investment securities portfolio during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Regulatory Capital 
    
  Financial institutions and their holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on a company s financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, financial institutions must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting guidelines. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments made by the regulators about components, risk-weighting and other factors. 
    
  In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Among other things, the rule establishes a new Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets). The rule limits an organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
    
  The final rule became effective for Northwest on January 1, 2015.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective.  
    
  Quantitative measures, established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy, require financial institutions to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, CET1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).  Capital ratios are presented in the tables below.  Dollar amounts in the accompanying tables are in thousands.

Liquidity 
    
  We are required to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets, as determined by management and reviewed for adequacy by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking during their regular examinations. Northwest monitors its liquidity position primarily using the ratio of unencumbered available-for-sale liquid assets as a percentage of deposits and borrowings ( liquidity ratio ).  Northwest s liquidity ratio at   September 30, 2016   was 12.6%. We adjust liquidity levels in order to meet funding needs for deposit outflows, payment of real estate taxes and insurance on mortgage loan escrow accounts, repayment of borrowings and loan commitments.  At   September 30, 2016   Northwest had $3.299 billion of additional borrowing capacity available with the FHLB, including $150.0 million on an overnight line of credit, as well as $111.0 million of borrowing capacity available with the Federal Reserve Bank and $80.0 million with two correspondent banks. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  We paid $15.1 million and $13.0 million in cash dividends during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The common stock dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share divided by net income per share) was 107.1% and 107.7% for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, on regular dividends of $0.15 per share for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and on regular dividends of $0.14 per share for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .     We paid $45.0 million and $38.9 million in cash dividends during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The common stock dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share divided by net income per share) was 180.0% and 87.5% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, on regular dividends of $0.45 per share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and on regular dividends of $0.42 per share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . On October 19, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.15 per share payable on November 17, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 3, 2016.  This represents the 88  th   consecutive quarter we have paid a cash dividend. 
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
    
  The following table sets forth information with respect to nonperforming assets.  Nonaccrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest has ceased.  Generally, when a loan is 90 days past due, we fully reverse all accrued interest thereon and cease to accrue interest thereafter.  Exceptions are made for loans that have contractually matured, are in the process of being modified to extend the maturity date and are otherwise current as to principal and interest, and well secured loans that are in process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual before they reach 90 days past due if conditions exist that call into question our ability to collect all contractual interest.  Other nonperforming assets represent property acquired through foreclosure or repossession. Foreclosed property is carried at the lower of its fair value less estimated costs to sell, or the principal balance of the related loan.

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , we expect to fully collect the carrying value of our purchased credit impaired loans and have determined that we can reasonably estimate their future cash flows including those loans that are 90 days or more delinquent. As a result, we do not consider these loans that are 90 days or more delinquent, which total $2.9 million, to be nonaccrual or impaired and continue to recognize interest income on these loans, including the loans  accretable discount. 
    
  A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement including both contractual principal and interest payments.  The amount of impairment is required to be measured using one of three methods: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the loan s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, a specific allowance is allocated for the impairment. Impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were $116.4 million and $117.9 million, respectively. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  Our Board of Directors has adopted an  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  ( ALL ) policy designed to provide management with a systematic methodology for determining and documenting the ALL each reporting period.  This methodology was developed to provide a consistent process and review procedure to ensure that the ALL is in conformity with GAAP, our policies and procedures and other supervisory and regulatory guidelines. 
    
  On an ongoing basis, the Credit Administration department, as well as loan officers, branch managers and department heads, review and monitor the loan portfolio for problem loans.  This portfolio monitoring includes a review of the monthly delinquency reports as well as historical comparisons and trend analysis.  In addition, a meeting is held every quarter with each region to monitor the performance and status of loans on an internal watch list.  On an on-going basis the loan officer in conjunction with a portfolio manager grades or classifies problem loans or potential problem loans based upon their knowledge of the lending relationship and other information previously accumulated.  This rating is also reviewed independently by our Loan Review department on a periodic basis.  Our loan grading system for problem loans is consistent with industry regulatory guidelines which classify loans as  substandard ,  doubtful  or  loss.   Loans that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the previous categories, but which possess some weaknesses, are designated as  special mention .  A  substandard  loan is any loan that is 90 days or more contractually delinquent or is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans classified as  doubtful  have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as  substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions or values, highly questionable and improbable.  Loans classified as  loss  are considered uncollectible so that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. 
    
  Credit relationships that have been classified as substandard or doubtful and are greater than or equal to $1.0 million are reviewed by the Credit Administration department for possible impairment.  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including both contractual principal and interest payments. 
    
  If such an individual loan is deemed to be impaired, the Credit Administration department determines the proper measure of impairment for each loan based on one of three methods: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the loan s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less costs of sale or disposal.  If the measurement of the impaired loan is more or less than the recorded investment in the loan, the Credit Administration department adjusts the specific allowance associated with that individual loan accordingly. 
    
  If a substandard or doubtful loan is not considered individually for impairment, it is grouped with other loans that possess common characteristics for impairment evaluation and analysis.  This segmentation is accomplished by grouping loans of similar product types, risk characteristics and industry concentration into homogeneous pools.  Historical loss ratios are analyzed and adjusted based on delinquency trends as well as the current economic, political, regulatory, and interest rate environment and used to estimate the current measure of impairment. 
    
  The individual impairment measures along with the estimated loss for each homogeneous pool are consolidated into one summary document.   This summary schedule along with the support documentation used to establish this schedule is presented to management s Credit Committee on a quarterly basis.  The Credit Committee reviews the processes and documentation presented, reviews the concentration of credit by industry and customer, lending products and activity, competition and collateral values, as well as economic conditions in general and in each of our market areas.  Based on this review and discussion, the appropriate amount of ALL is estimated and any adjustments to reconcile the actual ALL with this estimate are determined.  In addition, the

Credit Committee considers if any changes to the methodology are needed.  The Credit Committee also reviews and discusses delinquency trends, nonperforming asset amounts and ALL levels and ratios compared to our peer group as well as state and national statistics.  Similarly, following the Credit Committee s review and approval, a review is performed by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 
    
  In addition to the reviews by management s Credit Committee and the Board of Directors  Risk Management Committee, regulators from either the FDIC or the Pennsylvania Department of Banking perform an extensive review on an annual basis for the adequacy of the ALL and its conformity with regulatory guidelines and pronouncements.  Any recommendations or enhancements from these independent parties are considered by management and the Credit Committee and implemented accordingly. 
    
  We acknowledge that this is a dynamic process and consists of factors, many of which are external and out of our control that can change often, rapidly and substantially.  The adequacy of the ALL is based upon estimates using all the information previously discussed as well as current and known circumstances and events.  There is no assurance that actual portfolio losses will not be substantially different than those that were estimated. 
    
  We utilize a structured methodology each period when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses, which the Credit Committee assesses regularly for appropriateness.  As part of the analysis as of   September 30, 2016  , we considered the economic conditions in our markets, such as unemployment and bankruptcy levels as well as changes in estimates of real estate collateral values.  In addition, we considered the overall trends in asset quality, specific reserves already established for criticized loans, historical loss rates and collateral valuations. The allowance for loan losses increased by $574,000, or 0.9%, to $63.2 million, or 0.81% of total loans at   September 30, 2016   from $62.7 million, or 0.87% of total loans, at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase is primarily attributable to the downgrade of five commercial loan relationships that required combined reserves totaling $2.9 million.  
    
  We also consider how the levels of non-accrual loans and historical charge-offs have influenced the required amount of allowance for loan losses.  Nonaccrual loans of $86.3 million or 1.11% of total loans receivable at   September 30, 2016   increased by $14.6 million, or 20.4%, from $71.7 million, or 0.94% of total loans receivable, at   December 31, 2015  . As a percentage of average loans, annualized net charge-offs decreased to 0.20% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 0.23% for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarters Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was $14.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, an increase of $1.3 million, or 10.3%, from net income of $12.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in net income resulted from increases in net interest income of $11.7 million, or 17.5%, and noninterest income of $2.7 million, or 14.8%, and a decrease in income tax expense of $541,000, or 10.3%. Partially offsetting these improvements to net income was an increase in provision for loan losses of $2.4 million, or 74.9%, and an increase in noninterest expense of $11.2 million, or 17.6%. Annualized, net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   represents returns on average equity and average assets of 4.89% and 0.63%, respectively, compared to 4.54% and 0.59% for the same quarter last year.  A further discussion of significant changes follows. 
    
  Interest Income 
    
  Total interest income increased by $5.0 million, or 6.2%, to $86.1 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $81.1 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is the result of an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of $425.7 million, or 5.5%, to $8.193 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $7.768 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets to 4.18% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 4.19% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest income on loans receivable increased by $6.3 million, or 8.3%, to $82.4 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $76.1 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase in interest income on loans receivable can be attributed to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of $773.0 million, or 11.7%, to $7.358 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $6.585 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is due primarily to the addition of $928.1 million of loans, at fair value, from the LNB acquisition which closed on August 15, 2015. In addition, $455.9 million of loan balances, at fair value, were added from the FNFG branch acquisition on September 9, 2016. Also contributing to this increase was internal loan growth of $191.1 million during the past year due to continued success in growing commercial b

anking relationships and our indirect automobile lending portfolio. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the average yield on loans receivable which decreased to 4.46% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 4.63% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decline in average yield is due primarily to the historically low level of market interest rates, as well as the overall lower average yield from the acquired LNB portfolio. 
    
  Interest income on mortgage-backed securities decreased by $200,000, or 9.0%, to $2.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $2.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $57.8 million, or 11.6%, to $441.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $498.8 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The cash flows from our existing portfolio were redirected to fund loan growth. Offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities to 1.84% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 1.79% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   due to the LNB portfolio having higher yields than our existing portfolio.  
    
  Interest income on investment securities decreased by $921,000, or 41.4%, to $1.3 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $2.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The average balance of investment securities decreased by $207.0 million, or 42.9%, to $275.7 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $482.7 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is due primarily to the maturity or call of municipal and government agency securities. The cash flows from our existing portfolio were redirected to fund loan growth and payoff FHLB advances. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average yield of investment securities to 1.89% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 1.84% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Dividends on FHLB stock decreased by $233,000, or 51.7%, to $218,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $451,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is attributable to decreases in both the average balance and average yield. The average yield of FHLB stock decreased to 3.12% for the quarter ended    September 30, 2016   from 4.52% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, the average balance of FHLB stock decreased by $11.8 million, or 29.8% to $27.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $39.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Required FHLB stock holdings fluctuate with, among other things, the utilization of our borrowing capacity as well as capital requirements established by the FHLB. 
    
  Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased by $15,000, or 15.2%, to $114,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $99,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits to 0.49% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 0.24% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of the 25 basis point increase in December 2015 of the Federal Funds rate targeted by the Federal Reserve Bank. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average balance of $70.8 million, or 43.7%, to $91.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $162.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the utilization of cash to payoff FHLB advances and fund loan growth.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense decreased by $6.7 million, or 47.3%, to $7.5 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $14.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which decreased to 0.47% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 0.91% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is due primarily to the payoff of all FHLB advances on September 12, 2016. Additionally, the average cost of each deposit type declined from the prior year in this low interest rate environment. Partially offsetting the decrease in cost was an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $194.2 million, or 3.2%, to $6.353 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $6.159 billion for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was due primarily to the addition of $1.643 billion, at fair value, of deposit balances from the FNFG branch acquisition on September 9, 2016 and our success at generating new low-cost deposit relationships.  
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income increased by $11.7 million, or 17.5%, to $78.6 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $66.9 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is attributable to the factors discussed above. The repayment of all FHLB advances and the FNFG branch acquisition which provided $1.464 billion in low-cost non-maturity deposits improved our net interest spread and margin. Our net interest rate spread increased to 3.71% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 3.28% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   and our net interest margin increased to 3.84% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from 3.45% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses increased by $2.3 million, or 74.9%, to $5.5 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $3.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is due primarily to the downgrade of four commercial loans requiring an additional $1.9 million of combined reserves. In addition, annualized net charge-offs increased for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to 0.17% of total loans compared to 0.10% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . However, the percentage of classified loans to total loans decreased to 2.73% at   September 30, 2016   from 2.81% at   September 30, 2015  .  Additionally, delinquent loans to total loans decreased at   September 30, 2016   to 1.11% from 1.20% at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In determining the amount of the current period provision, we considered current economic conditions, including but not limited to unemployment levels and bankruptcy filings, and changes in real estate values and the impact of these factors on the quality of our loan portfolio and historical loss factors.  We analyze the allowance for loan losses as described in the section entitled  Allowance for Loan Losses.   The provision that is recorded is sufficient, in our judgment, to bring this reserve to a level that reflects the losses inherent in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix, economic conditions and historical loss experience. 
    
  Noninterest Income 
    
  Noninterest income increased by $2.7 million, or 14.8%, to $20.8 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $18.1 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily attributable to increases in mortgage banking income and service charges and fees. Mortgage banking income increased by $1.6 million, or 606.4%, to $1.9 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $267,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the resumption of sales of residential mortgage loan originations from our Wholesale Lending Division into the secondary market. Service charges and fees increased by $1.1 million, or 10.7%, to $11.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $9.9 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   due primarily to the growth in checking accounts from both the LNB and FNFG acquisitions, and the successful execution of internal growth initiatives.  
    
  Noninterest Expense 
    
  Noninterest expense increased by $11.2 million, or 17.6%, to $75.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $63.8 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is primarily the result of increases in compensation and employee benefits, processing expenses, amortization of intangible assets, marketing expenses, and other expense. Compensation and employee benefits increased by $8.5 million, or 27.3%, to $39.5 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $31.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is due primarily to the employees retained from the LNB and FNFG acquisitions and the $5.1 million cost associated with the termination of Northwest's ESOP. Processing expenses increased by $718,000, or 8.8%, to $8.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $8.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to the acquisitions of LNB and FNFG, as well as technology upgrades. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense were increases in amortization of intangible assets of $646,000, or 153.1%, and marketing expenses of $548,000, or 32.4%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. These increases are due primarily to the acquisitions of LNB and 18 FNFG branches. Lastly, other expense increased $1.0 million, or 54.6%, from the same period last year largely due to Ohio Franchise tax that we are now subject to as a result of the LNB acquisition. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes decreased by $541,000, or 10.3%, to $4.7 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from $5.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of a decrease in our effective tax rate for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to 24.9% compared to 28.9% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is due primarily the lower amount of taxable income subject to Pennsylvania's mutual thrift tax as a result of our increased operations in the states of Ohio and New York. We anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 28.0% and 30.0% for all of   2016  .

Comparison of Operating Results for the     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016     and     2015    
    
  Net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $25.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, a decrease of $19.1 million, or 43.2%, from $44.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in net income resulted from increases in noninterest expense of $68.9 million, or 39.9%, and provision for loan losses of $6.3 million, or 122.7%. Partially offsetting these factors were increases in net interest income of $34.8 million, or 18.1%, and noninterest income of $11.2 million, or 22.8%, as well as a decrease in income tax expense of of $10.0 million, or 51.8%. Annualized, net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   represents returns on average equity and average assets of 2.90% and 0.38%, respectively, compared to 5.47% and 0.73% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  A discussion of significant changes follows. 
    
  Interest Income 
    
  Total interest income increased by $24.2 million, or 10.3%, to $258.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $233.9 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase is the result of increases in both the average balance of and average yield earned on interest earning assets. The average balance of interest earning assets increased by $696.2 million, or 9.3%, to $8.157 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $7.461 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased to 4.23% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 4.17% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest income on loans receivable increased by $28.1 million, or 12.9%, to $245.9 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $217.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This increase in interest income on loans receivable can be attributed to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of $1.050 billion, or 16.9%, to $7.278 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $6.228 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase is due primarily to the addition of $928.1 million of loan balances, at fair value, from the LNB acquisition on August 14, 2015. Also contributing to this increase was internal loan growth of $191.1 million during the past year due to continued success in growing commercial banking relationships and our indirect automobile lending portfolio. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the average yield on loans receivable which decreased to 4.51% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 4.68% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decline in average yield is due primarily to the continued historically low level of market interest rates, as well as the overall lower yield of the acquired LNB portfolio. 
    
  Interest income on mortgage-backed securities decreased by $148,000, or 2.3%, to $6.4 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and from $6.5 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $31.9 million, or 6.5%, to $462.5 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $494.4 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The cash flow from these securities was redirected to payoff FHLB advances and fund loan growth.  Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average yield on mortgage-backed securities to 1.84% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 1.76% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to the acquisition of the higher yielding LNB portfolio. 
    
  Interest income on investment securities decreased by $2.4 million, or 34.3%, to $4.5 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $6.9 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease is the result of decreases in both the average balance and average yield. The average balance of investment securities decreased by $158.4 million, or 32.7%, to $325.4 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $483.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is due primarily to the maturity or call of municipal and government agency securities and the use of these proceeds to pay off FHLB advances and fund loan growth. The average yield on investment securities decreased to 1.86% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 1.90% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is primarily the result of higher rate, tax-free, municipal securities maturing or being called and, if replaced, being replaced by lower yielding, shorter duration government agency securities.   
    
  Dividends on FHLB stock decreased by $1.2 million, or 53.4%, to $1.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $2.3 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease is due primarily to the $1.0 million special dividend which was paid in the first quarter of 2015.  The average balance decreased by $4.4 million, or 11.9%, to $32.7 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $37.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, the average yield, exclusive of the special dividend, decreased to 4.44% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 4.64% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Required FHLB stock holdings fluctuate with, among other things, the utilization of our borrowing capacity as well as capital requirements established by the FHLB.

Interest income on interest-earning deposits decreased by $175,000, or 41.9%, to $243,000 for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $418,000 for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This decrease is due to a decrease in the average balance of $159.2 million, or 73.3%, to $58.0 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $217.2 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to the utilization of cash to pay off FHLB advances and fund loan growth.  Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits to 0.55% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 0.25% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , as a result of the 25 basis point increase in December 2015 of the Federal Funds rate targeted by the Federal Reserve Bank. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense decreased by $10.6 million, or 25.4%, to $31.2 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $41.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This decrease in interest expense was due to a decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which decreased to 0.65% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 0.95% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease is due primarily to the replacement of long-term FHLB borrowings with lower cost short-term FHLB advances in May 2016 and the replacement of those short-term advances in September 2016 with the deposits received from the FNFG branch acquisition. Also contributing to this decrease was the shift in deposit mix  towards more lower cost or no cost deposits. Additionally, the average cost of each deposit type declined from the prior year in this low interest rate environment. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, which increased by $484.5 million, or 8.2%, to $6.394 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $5.909 billion for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was due primarily to the addition of $1.017 billion, at fair value, of deposit balances from the LNB acquisition on August 14, 2015 and our success at attracting new checking account customers.  
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income increased by $34.8 million, or 18.1%, to $226.9 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $192.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This increase is attributable to the factors discussed above. Redirecting existing funds and cash flow from investment securities to fund the LNB acquisition, which provided $1.140 billion of interest-earning assets, and the refinancing and subsequent repayment of all FHLB advances, improved our net interest spread and margin. Our net interest rate spread increased to 3.57% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 3.22% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and our net interest margin increased to 3.71% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from 3.41% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses increased by $6.3 million, or 122.7%, to $11.4 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $5.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This increase is due primarily to the downgrading of five commercial loans throughout the year requiring an additional $2.9 million in combined reserves and increases in reserves for growth in our indirect auto loans. However, the percentage of classified loans to total loans decreased to 2.73% at   September 30, 2016   from 2.81%  at   September 30, 2015  . In addition, annualized net charge-offs decreased for the   nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2016   to 0.20% of total loans compared to 0.26% for the   nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In determining the amount of the current period provision, we considered current economic conditions, including unemployment levels and bankruptcy filings, and changes in real estate values and the impact of these factors on the quality of our loan portfolio and historical loss factors.  We analyze the allowance for loan losses as described in the section entitled  Allowance for Loan Losses.   The provision that is recorded is sufficient, in our judgment, to bring this reserve to a level that reflects the losses inherent in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix, economic conditions and historical loss experience. 
    
  Noninterest Income 
    
  Noninterest income increased by $11.2 million, or 22.8%, to $60.5 million for the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016   from $49.3 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is attributable to increases in all noninterest income categories with the exception of gain on sale of investments.  Service charges and fees increased by $3.9 million, or 13.9%, to $31.7 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $27.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due primarily to the growth in checking accounts from both the LNB acquisition and the successful execution of internal growth initiatives. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest income was an decrease in loss on sale of real estate owned of $1.6 million, as we recognized a net loss of $203,000 for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a net loss of $1.8 million for the same period last year. Mortgage banking income increased by $1.8 million, or 251.7%, to $2.6 million for the   nine  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

months ended     September 30, 2016   from $725,000 for the   nine months ended      September 30, 2015  , due to the resumption of sales of residential mortgage loan originations from our Wholesale Lending Division into the secondary market. In addition, other operating income increased by $1.4 million, or 54.4%, to $4.0 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $2.6 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due primarily to income on paid-off purchased credit impaired loans. Both trust and other financial services income and insurance commission income increased by approximately $1.0 million, respectively, as these business lines have benefited from acquisitions and internal growth initiatives.  
    
  Noninterest Expense 
    
  Noninterest expense increased by $68.9 million, or 39.9%, to $241.6 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $172.7 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This increase is primarily the result of a FHLB prepayment penalty and, to a lesser extent, increases in compensation and employee benefits, restructuring and acquisition expense, other expense, and processing expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we replaced long-term FHLB borrowings with lower cost short-term advances incurring a $37.0 million prepayment penalty in May 2015. This refinancing occurred in anticipation of the acquisition of 18 First Niagara branches with deposits of approximately $1.600 billion. Compensation and employee benefits increased by $19.1 million, or 21.7%, to $106.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase is the result of the employees retained from both the LNB and FNFG acquisitions, higher health-care costs, and the costs associated with the ESOP termination. Additionally, acquisition and restructuring expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 33.3%. Acquisition and restructuring expense in the prior year related to the LNB acquisition. In the current year those similar charges relate to the FNFG branch acquisition as well as $3.0 million related to the consolidation of 24 branches into existing offices in April 2016. Also contributing to this increase in noninterest expense was an increase in other expense of $3.9 million, or 64.5%, as a result of an increase in charitable contributions made to utilize Pennsylvania Education Improvement Tax Credits and nine months of the Ohio Franchise tax. Processing expense increased by $2.7 million, or 11.9%, to $25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to technology upgrades, the additional maintenance costs attributable to the addition of the LNB and FNFG operations, and the replacement of debit cards in an effort to enhance customer security.   
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes decreased by $10.0 million, or 51.8%, to $9.3 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from $19.3 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of a decrease in pretax income of $29.2 million, or 45.8%. Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was 27.0% compared to 30.3% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  We anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 28.0% and 30.0% for all of 2016.

ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  As the holding company for a savings bank, one of our primary market risks is interest rate risk.  Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income to variations in interest rates over a specified time period.  The sensitivity results from differences in the time periods in which interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities mature or re-price.  We attempt to control interest rate risk by matching, within acceptable limits, the re-pricing periods of assets and liabilities.  We have attempted to limit our exposure to interest sensitivity by increasing core deposits, enticing customers to extend certificates of deposit maturities, borrowing funds with fixed-rates and longer maturities and by shortening the maturities of our assets by emphasizing the origination of more short-term fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans. We also continue to sell a portion of the long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans that we originate.  In addition, we purchase shorter term or adjustable-rate investment securities and mortgage-backed securities. 
    
  We have an Asset/Liability Committee consisting of members of management which meets monthly to review market interest rates, economic conditions, the pricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the balance sheet structure.  On a quarterly basis, this Committee also reviews the interest rate risk position and cash flow projections. 
    
  The Board of Directors has a Risk Management Committee which meets quarterly and reviews interest rate risk and trends, our interest sensitivity position, the liquidity position and the market risk inherent in the investment portfolio. 
    
  In an effort to assess interest rate risk and market risk, we utilize a simulation model to determine the effect of immediate incremental increases and decreases in interest rates on net income and the market value of equity.  Certain assumptions are made regarding loan prepayments and decay rates of savings and interest-bearing demand accounts.  Because it is difficult to accurately  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

project the market reaction of depositors and borrowers, the effect of actual changes in interest rates on these assumptions may differ from simulated results.  We have established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk: 
    
  Net interest income simulation  .  Given a non-parallel shift of 100 basis points ( bps ), 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the estimated net income may not decrease by more than 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively, within a one-year period. 
    
  Net income simulation  .  Given a non-parallel shift of 100 basis points ( bps ), 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the estimated net income may not decrease by more than 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively, within a one-year period. 
    
  Market value of equity simulation  .  The market value of equity is the present value of assets and liabilities.  Given a non-parallel shift of 100 bps, 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the market value of equity may not decrease by more than 15%, 30% and 35%, respectively, from the computed economic value at current interest rate levels. 
    
  The following table illustrates the simulated impact of a 100 bps, 200 bps or 300 bps upward or a 100 bps downward movement in interest rates on net income, return on average equity, earnings per share and market value of equity.  This analysis was prepared assuming that interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels at   September 30, 2016   remain constant.  The impact of the rate movements was computed by simulating the effect of an immediate and sustained shift in interest rates over a twelve-month period from   September 30, 2016   levels. 

The figures included in the table above represent projections that were computed based upon certain assumptions including prepayment rates and decay rates.  These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates.  Actual results may differ significantly due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions. 

ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the  Evaluation Date ).  Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  There were no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report or in other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.                   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are subject to a number of asserted and unasserted claims encountered in the normal course of business.  We believe that any additional liability, other than that which has already been accrued, that may result from such potential litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements.  However, we cannot presently determine whether or not any claims against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period.  See note 12.
