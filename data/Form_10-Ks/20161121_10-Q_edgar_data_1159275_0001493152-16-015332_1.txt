1.
 Description of Business and Organization    

References
herein to  Kiwa  or the  Company  refer to Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise.  

Business
  The Company s business is to develop, manufacture, distribute and market innovative, cost-effective and environmentally
safe bio-technological products for agriculture markets located primarily in China. The Company has acquired technologies to produce
and market bio-fertilizer.  

Acquisition
of Caber Holdings Ltd  - On November 30, 2015, we entered into an acquisition agreement (the  Agreement ) with
the shareholders of Caber Holdings LTD, whose Chinese name is Hong Kong Baina Group Co., Ltd, located in Hong Kong ( Baina
Hong Kong ), and Oriental Baina Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as  Baina Beijing ), Baina Hong Kong s
wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing, China. Kiwa will rename Baina Beijing to Kiwa Baiao Co. Ltd. Kiwa Baiao Co. Ltd will replace
Kiwa s current subsidiary in China - Kiwa Bio-Tech (Shandong) Co., Ltd ( Kiwa Shandong ) - to operate Kiwa s
bio-fertilizer market expansion and become Kiwa s platform for future acquisitions of new agricultural-related projects
in China. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, Kiwa agreed to pay US$30,000 to the Baina Hong Kong Shareholders for
the acquisition of 100% of the equity of Baina Hong Kong. The acquisition was completed on January 7, 2016. Both Baina Hong Kong
and Baina Beijing had no activities before the acquisition date and had no assets and liabilities. The purpose of this acquisition
was to acquire Baina Hong Kong s corporate registration in Hong Kong and in China. The total payment of approximately $34,000
was recorded as intangible assets.  

Restatement  - Based on the previously
restated consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 which were filed with company s annual report
Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the management of the Company has concluded that consolidated statement of comprehensive
income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 should be restated to record accrued interest expense of
$22,500 and $67,500 respectively. (see Note 9) 

2.
 Going Concern    

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not purport to represent the realizable or settlement values.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $545. The Company had working capital deficit of $3,442,227 and an accumulated
deficit of $ 19,993,105 and a stockholders  deficiency of $5,024,944 as of September 30, 2016. This trend is expected to
continue. These factors, among others, create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The Company plans to (1) raise finance from
related-parties, local banks, other financial institutions and other stock market to meet cash demand of daily demand; and (2)
raise capital to resume operations. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining this financing
(3) The Company s business plan is to develop, manufacture, distribute and market innovative, cost-effective and environmentally
safe biotechnological products for agriculture markets located primarily in China. The Company has acquired technologies to produce
and market bio-fertilizer.

 Summaries of Significant Accounting Policies    

Principle
of consolidation  - These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances or transactions are eliminated on consolidation.  

Basis
of preparation  - These interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim condensed
consolidated financial statements have been included. The results reported in the consolidated financial statements for any interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year or any other periods. The (a) consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from audited financial statements, and (b) the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company
believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

Reverse
Split  - On January 14, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation with the State
of Delaware with reference to a 1-for-200 reverse stock split with respect to its Common Stock with effective date of January
28, 2016. In connection with the reverse split, the Company s authorized capital stock was amended to be 120,000,000 shares,
comprising 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock par value $0.001 and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock par value $0.001. All
relevant information relating to numbers of shares, options and per share information have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect
the reverse stock split for all periods presented.  

Use
of Estimates  - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant accounting estimates include the bad debt provision, impairment
of long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization, valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and fair value of warrants and
options.  

Foreign
Currency Translation  - The Company uses United States dollars ( US Dollar  or  US$  or  $ )
for financial reporting purposes. However, the Company maintains the books and records in its functional currency, Chinese Renminbi
( RMB ), being the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operations are conducted. In general,
the Company translates its assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date, and the statement of income is translated at average exchange rates during the reporting period. Equity accounts are
translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Company s financial statements are recorded
as accumulated other comprehensive income.  

The
exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into U.S. Dollars for the purposes of preparing the condensed consolidated financial
statements were as follows:  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets  - We periodically evaluate our investment in long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for
recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our judgments
regarding potential impairment are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance indicators, among others.
In assessing the impairment of property and equipment, we make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other
factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. Based on our analysis, no further impairment of long-lived assets
was charged during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Revenue
Recognition  - The Company s revenue includes two parts: Part I represents fees per licensing agreement. The Company
entered into an agreement with a company, Kangtan Gerui (Beijing) Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. ( Gerui ), to allow Gerui sell
products with the Company s trademark. Gerui will pay 10% of total sales amount to the Company as license fee.  

Part
II represents the revenues from sales of products purchased. The Company recognized license fees and revenue from sales of products
when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, and no other significant obligations
of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers.  

Accounts
Receivables  - Accounts receivables represent customer accounts receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
a combination of current sales, historical charge offs and specific accounts identified as high risk. Uncollectible accounts receivable
are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all reasonable efforts to collect the amounts due have been exhausted.
Such allowances, if any, would be recorded in the period the impairment is identified.

  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

Income
Taxes  - The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 740,  Income Tax,  which
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company establishes
a valuation when it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered.  

Fair
value measurements   - ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes
a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There
are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.  

The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and short-term debts approximate their fair values
due to their short maturities.  

There
were no assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

4.
 Prepaid expenses    

The
Company issued 1,710,808 shares of common stock to three consulting companies for the investor relation consulting service and
four individuals for the growth and development strategy consulting service in China, which represents the amount of $1,688,300
based on quoted price at issuance. The Company amortized the consulting fee over the service periods per agreements. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the amortization of consulting expense was $57,717.  

5.
 Advance to customer - Gerui    

As
of September 30, 2016, Advance to customer-Gerui was $1,677,459, which represents the prepayment to Gerui, the main customer,
to subcontract the manufacturing of products to an unrelated company, Shandong Deluke Company.

at 6% and were due on June 29, 2009. Once the note is pass due, the interest rate increased to 15% per annum. The Company accrued
$16,919 and $16,857 interest expense on convertible notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
conversion price of the 6% Notes is based on a 40% discount to the average of the trading price of the Company s common
stock on the OTC Bulletin Board over a 20-day trading period. The conversion price is also adjusted for certain subsequent issuances
of equity securities of the Company at prices below the conversion price then in effect. The 6% Notes contain a volume limitation
that prohibits the holder from further converting the 6% Notes if doing so would cause the holder and its affiliates to hold more
than 4.99% of the Company s outstanding common stock. In addition, the holder of the 6% Notes agrees that they may not convert
more than their pro-rata share (based on original principal amount) of the greater of $120,000 principal amount of the 6% Notes
per calendar month or the average daily dollar volume calculated during the 10 business days prior to a conversion, per conversion.
This conversion limit has since been eliminated pursuant to an agreement by the Company and the Purchasers.  

The
Company incurs a financial penalty in cash or shares at the option of the Company (equal to 2% of the outstanding amount of the
Notes per month plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, prorated for partial months) if it breaches this or other affirmative
covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including a covenant to maintain a sufficient number of authorized shares under its Certificate
of Incorporation to cover at least 110% of the stock issuable upon full conversion of the Notes. Pursuant to the relevant provisions
for liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement, the Company has accrued the penalty of $57,672 and $53,605 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
6% Notes require the Company to procure the Purchaser s consent prior to taking certain actions including the payment of
dividends, repurchasing stock, incurring debt, guaranteeing obligations, merging or restructuring the Company, or selling significant
assets.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2016 contains  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements that include the
words  believes,   expects,   anticipates,  or similar expressions. These forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements concerning our expectations regarding our working capital requirements, financing
requirements, business, growth prospects, competition and results of operations, and other statements of expectations, beliefs,
future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical
facts. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2016 involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.   

Overview    

The
Company took its present corporate form in March 2004 when shareholders of Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Ltd. ( Kiwa BVI ),
a company originally organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on June 5, 2002 and Tintic Gold Mining Company ( Tintic ),
a corporation originally incorporated in the state of Utah on June 14, 1933 to perform mining operations in Utah, entered into
a share exchange transaction. The share exchange transaction left the shareholders of Kiwa BVI owning a majority of Tintic and
Kiwa BVI a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tintic. For accounting purposes this transaction was treated as an acquisition of Tintic
by Kiwa BVI in the form of a reverse triangular merger and a recapitalization of Kiwa BVI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Kiwa
Bio-Tech Products (Shandong) Co., Ltd. ( Kiwa Shandong ). On July 21, 2004, we completed our reincorporation in the
State of Delaware.  

We
have established a subsidiary in China, Kiwa Shandong in 2002, a wholly-owned subsidiary, engaging in the bio-fertilizer business.
Formerly, our subsidiary Tianjin Kiwa Feed Co., Ltd. ( Kiwa Tianjin ), was engaged in the bio-enhanced feed business.
At the end of 2009, Kiwa Tianjin could no longer use its assets including machinery and inventory in the normal course of operations.
The Company has classified the bio-enhanced feed business as discontinued operations. Effective on July 11, 2012, the Company
formally dissolved Kiwa Tianjin and Kiwa Shandong is inactive as of September 30, 2016.  

On
November 30, 2015, we entered into an acquisition agreement (the  Agreement ) with the shareholders of Caber Holdings
LTD, whose Chinese name is Hong Kong Baina Group Co., Ltd, located in Hong Kong ( Baina Hong Kong ), and Oriental
Baina Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as  Baina Beijing ), Baina Hong Kong s wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing,
China. Kiwa will rename Baina Beijing to Kiwa Baiao Co. Ltd. Kiwa Baiao Co. Ltd will replace Kiwa s current subsidiary in
China - Kiwa Bio-Tech (Shandong) Co., Ltd ( Kiwa Shandong ) - to operate Kiwa s bio-fertilizer market expansion
and become Kiwa s platform for future acquisitions of new agricultural-related projects in China. In accordance with the
terms of the Agreement, Kiwa agreed to pay US$30,000 to the Baina Hong Kong Shareholders for the acquisition of 100% of the equity
of Baina Hong Kong. The acquisition was completed on January 7, 2016. Both Baina Hong Kong and Baina Beijing had no activities
before the acquisition date and had no assets and liabilities. The purpose of this acquisition was to acquire Baina Hong Kong s
corporate registration in Hong Kong and in China. The total payment of approximately $34,000 was recorded as intangible assets.  

We
started to generate some revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compare with no revenues in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. We incurred a net income of $331,707 and a net loss $480,051 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  

The
Company entered into an agreement with a company, Kangtan Gerui (Beijing) Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. ( Gerui ), to allow Gerui
sell products with the Company s trademark. Gerui will pay 10% of total sales amount to the Company as license fee. The
Company recognized license fees when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed,
and no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured.  

The
Company also entered into agreement with a company, Qingzhou Agricultural Supply Company ( Qingzhou ), on August 1,
2016, to sell 6500 tons of products before December 31, 2016. As of September 28, 2016, the Company has shipped out all the products
and recognized revenue of $1,185,309 during the third quarter of this year.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $545. Due to shortage of working capital, we have relied on the proceeds from advances
from related parties to provide the necessary to fund the development of our business plan and operations. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net amount advanced by related parties was $51,500. These funds are insufficient to execute our business
plan as currently contemplated. Management is currently looking for alternative sources of capital to fund our operations.  

Going
Concern    

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not purport to represent the realizable or settlement values.  

As
of September 30, 2016 we had an accumulated deficit of $19,993,105 and a stockholders  deficiency of $5,024,944. We currently
have negative working capital. We will require additional capital to fund our operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our current liabilities were $8,042,656 which exceeded current assets by $3,442,227, representing a current
ratio of 0.572; comparably, as of December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $48,174 and current liabilities of $9,378,304,
denoting a current ratio of 0.0051. If we can achieve the necessary financing to increase our working capital, we believe the
Company will be well-positioned to generate sales of our products and to generate more revenues in the future. There can be no
assurances that we will be successful in obtaining this financing or in increasing our sales revenue if we do obtain the enough
financing.  

Our
independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements
for the latest eight years, which states that the financial statements raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as
a going concern. Our ability to make operations profitable or obtain additional funding will determine our ability to continue
as a going concern.  

Trends
and Uncertainties in Regulation and Government Policy in China    

Foreign
Investment Policy Change in China    

On
March 16, 2007, China s parliament, the National People s Congress, adopted the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which took
effect on January 1, 2008. The new income tax law sets a unified income tax rate for domestic and foreign companies at 25% and
abolishes the favorable policy for foreign invested enterprises. As a result subsidiaries established in China in the future will
not enjoy the original favorable policy unless they are certified as qualified high and new technology enterprises.  

According
to the enterprise income tax law previously in effect, our PRC subsidiaries, Kiwa Shandong and Kiwa Tianjin, were exempt from
corporate income taxes for their first two profitable years and were entitled to a 50% tax reduction for the succeeding three
years. Now that the new income tax law is in effect, fiscal year 2008 is regarded as the first profitable year even if Kiwa Shandong
or Kiwa Tianjin were not profitable that year; thereby narrowing the time period when the favorable tax treatment may be available
to us.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Since
inception of our ag-biotech business in 2002, we have relied on the proceeds from the sale of our equity securities and loans
from both unrelated and related parties to provide the resources necessary to fund our operations and the execution of our business
plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the advances from related parties, net of repayment by the Company to related

current ratio of 0.572. Comparably, as of December 31, 2015, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $9,330,130, denoting
a current ratio of 0.005.  

As

from advances from related parties, net of repayment to related parties and $766,281 of which are generated from sales of common
stock to stockholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated $77,988 from financing activities due to
proceeds received from related party loans.  

Given
the facts that:  

Outstanding
note payable of $360,000 as of September 30, 2016. This note has been in default since July 2007.  

To
the extent that we are unable to successfully raise capital necessary to fund our future cash requirements on a timely basis and
under acceptable terms and conditions, we will not have sufficient cash resources to maintain operations, and may have to curtail
operations and consider a formal or informal restructuring or reorganization.  

Commitments
and Contingencies    

See
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 in Part I.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

At

often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market
or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to reasonably ensure that material information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The principal basis for this conclusion is the lack of segregation of duties within
our financial function and the lack of an operating Audit Committee.  

(b)       Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)

likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
