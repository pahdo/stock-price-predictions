  NOTE 1 BACKGROUND AND ORGANIZATION  
   
   Organization   
   
 Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. ( the Company ) was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2007, under the name Red Oak Concepts, Inc. to serve as a vehicle for a business combination through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination. On December 4, 2007, the Company changed its jurisdiction of domicile by merging with a Nevada corporation titled Red Oak Concepts, Inc. On November 21, 2008, the Company changed its name to Vinyl Products, Inc. in connection with a reverse acquisition transaction with The Vinyl Fence Company, Inc. ( VFC ), a California corporation. On September 26, 2013, the Company formed Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On October 8, 2013, the Company merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. and as part of the merger changed its name to Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. 
   
   Business Overview-Current Operations   
   
   AAA Century Group Transaction   
   
 Effective as of May 27, 2016, Doug Brackin and Joy Brackin, husband and wife (the  Sellers ), entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) pursuant to which the Sellers agreed to sell to AAA Century Group USA Corp., a newly-formed New York corporation (the  Purchaser ), the 20,000,000 shares of Company common stock owned by the Sellers, constituting approximately 88.6% of the Company s 22,564,000 issued and outstanding common shares (the  Shares ), for $337,000. As part of the AAA Century Group Transaction, all liabilities of the Company were paid in full at the closing of the AAA Century Group Transaction or shortly thereafter. 
   
 As a result of the sale there was a change of control of the Company. In connection with the sale pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Sellers and the Company s then directors and officers Doug Brackin and Keith Moore resigned their positions and appointed Qingxi Meng as the sole director. Mr. Meng was named the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and in August 2016, Ms. Yingchuan ( Shelley ) Wang was named Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and a director of the Company. 
   
 Current management intends to engage in real estate transactions in the New York area. As of the date of the filing of this Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has not entered into any letter of intent or binding agreement to acquire any new assets or business in addition to the Company s current securities crowdfunding activities, described below. 
   
 On September 20, 2016, the holders of 17,690,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately 78.4% of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, executed a written consent in lieu of a special meeting of stockholder approving the following matters: 
   
 (1) An amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, changing the name of the Company to AAA Century Group USA, Inc. 
   
 (2) An amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, increasing the number of the authorized common shares, $.0001 par value, from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000, and our authorized Preferred Shares, $.0001 par value, from 10,000,000 to 50,000,000; and 
   
 (3) Authorizing the Board of Directors to effectuate a forward split of the Company s 22,564,000 currently issued and outstanding common shares of no less than two-for-one and no more than five-for-one, as and when determined by the Company s Board of Directors.

Crowdfunding Business   
   
 The Company s business operations support securities crowdfunding ( SCF ) activities. SCF in its simplest terms, is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities. 
   
 The Company earns revenue by providing outsourced SCF services including due diligence and developing marketing programs for companies looking to utilize technology to reach a broader potential investor base. 
   
  NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Interim Financial Statements   
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures included in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed financial statements included in this document have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements, and in our opinion reflect all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with US GAAP and SEC regulations for interim financial statements. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that we will have for any subsequent period.  These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to those statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
   
   Liquidity   
   
 The Company's unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company reported net income of $20,416 during the quarter ended September30, 2016, due almost entirely because of the cancellation of debt as part of the change of control in June 2016, but has an accumulated deficit of $339,395 since inception. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 Management s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and/or a debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

AAA CENTURY GROUP USA, INC.  
  formerly  
  CROWD SHARES AFTERMARKET, INC.  
   
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Unaudited)  

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are adjusted to reflect actual experience when necessary. Significant estimates and assumptions affect many items in the financial statements. These include allowance for doubtful trade receivables, asset impairments, and contingencies and litigation. Significant estimates and assumptions are also used to establish the fair value and useful lives of depreciable tangible and certain intangible assets. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such results may affect income, financial position or cash flows. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. Deposits with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company did not have any cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Typically, the Company recognizes revenue from marketing and due diligence services. Such revenue is recognized when the services are performed. 
   
 Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable, collection of the fees is probable, delivery of the service and or product has occurred, and no other significant obligations on the part of the Company remain. 
   
   Income Taxes   
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the FASB. Under those standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through future operations. 
   
 No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $287,951 as of September 30, 2016 that will be offset against future taxable income. The available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $288,000 will expire in various years through 2036. No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements because the Company believes there is a 50% or greater chance the carry forwards will expire unused. The income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the US federal income tax rate of 35% to net loss before income taxes for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Certain tax attributes are subject to an annual limitation as a result of the sale of shares from the Brackins to AAA Century Group USA Corp., which constitutes a change of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.

AAA CENTURY GROUP USA, INC.  
  formerly  
  CROWD SHARES AFTERMARKET, INC.  
   
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Unaudited)  

Effective October 1, 2008, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820-10 ) and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Neither of these statements had an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. 
   
  NOTE 3 DEBT AND DUE TO RELATED PARTY  
   
 From May, 2016, through July, 2016, as part of the AAA Century Group Transaction, the Company entered into settlement agreements with all debt holders of the Company.

The Company entered into settlement agreements with the promissory noteholders.  The total amount owed for principal was $215,000, of which $190,000 was paid off at the change in ownership.  The remaining amount plus accrued interest was extinguished, resulting in a gain of $87,308.  Interest expense totaled $5,360 and $16,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 On February 7, 2015, the Company issued and sold a $12,000 Note due May 7, 2015.

Interest expense totaled $0 and $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A total gain of $2,000 was recognized as a result of this debt settlement. 
   
  NOTE 4- ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SETTLEMENT  
   
 The Company entered into settlement agreements with various vendors resulting in the payoff of various accounts payable balances. For the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a gain on settlement of accounts payable of $82,771.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
   
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise,  we,   us  and  our  refer to AAA Century Group USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provide information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and all our other filings, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) through the date of this report. 
   
  Forward Looking Statements  
   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes both historical and forward-looking statements, which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulations. Words such as  may,   should,   could,   would,   predicts,   potential,   continue,   expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates,  and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are intended to operate as  forward-looking statements  of the kind permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, incorporated in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). That legislation protects such predictive statements by creating a  safe harbor  from liability in the event that a particular prediction does not turn out as anticipated. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will probably not be accurate indications of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or our management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. You should review carefully the section entitled  Risk Factors  beginning on page 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain of the risks that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or suggested by the forward-looking statements. 
   
 The inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us, or any other person, that such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should be aware that any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of the foregoing, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements, the Company recorded net income of $146,855 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, owing almost exclusively to the gain on debt settlements.  We have a working capital deficit of $3,053 and an accumulated deficit of $339,395 at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $0. 
   
 We started to generate revenue in January 2011, in our crowdsharing operations. However, in order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Accordingly, management s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and other securities. 
   
 Our current funding is not sufficient to continue our operations for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. We will require additional debt and/or equity financing to continue our operations. We cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. 

11 

If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease or delay development of our operations, sell assets or our business may fail. In each such case, the holders of our common stock would lose all or most of their investment. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to the 10-K for descriptions of critical accounting policies. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   
 We are a smaller reporting company and therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this item of Form 10-Q. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, and this assessment identified certain material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, including material weaknesses due to our management s lack of segregation of duties in financial transactions or reporting as a result of the fact that we only have two officers. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 
   
 Based on that evaluation, and for the reasons stated above, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 The Company changed its Chief Financial Officer in June 2016, other than that change there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
