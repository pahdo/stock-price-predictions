1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the  Company  or  Cisco ) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July.   Fiscal 2017   is a 52-week fiscal year, and   fiscal 2016   was a 53-week fiscal year. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cisco and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company conducts business globally and is primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following   three   geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).  
  The accompanying financial data as of   October 29, 2016   and for the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015   has been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The   July 30, 2016   Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   July 30, 2016  . 
  The Company consolidates its investments in a venture fund managed by SOFTBANK Corp. and its affiliates ( SOFTBANK ) as this is a variable interest entity and the Company is the primary beneficiary. The noncontrolling interests attributed to SOFTBANK are presented as a separate component from the Company s equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. SOFTBANK s share of the earnings in the venture fund are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. 
  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated balance sheet as of   October 29, 2016  ; the results of operations, the statements of comprehensive income, the statements of cash flows and equity for the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015   as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods. 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period s presentation.  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued. 

2. 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     (a) New Accounting Updates Recently Adopted 
  Consolidation of Certain Types of Legal Entities    In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The accounting standard update became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The application of this accounting standard update did not have any impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations upon adoption, but the Company has provided additional disclosures in Note 8 pursuant to this accounting standard update.    
  (b) Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective 
  Revenue Recognition      In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standard update related to revenue from contracts with customers, which, along with amendments issued in 2015 and 2016, will supersede nearly all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. This accounting standard update, as amended, will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption ("modified retrospective basis"). Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal 2018. The Company expects to adopt this accounting standard update on a modified retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and it is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited)  

Financial Instruments    In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Leases    In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to leases requiring lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as corresponding right-of-use assets. The new lease standard also makes some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard. In addition, disclosures will be required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Share-Based Compensation    In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that impacts the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The accounting standard will be effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Credit Losses of Financial Instruments      In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption in fiscal 2020 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Classification of Cash Flow Elements      In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Income Taxes on Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets      In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets (other than inventory) at the transaction date. The accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

3. 
    Acquisitions and Divestitures  
     The Company completed   three   acquisitions during the three months ended   October 29, 2016  . A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions):   

  On   August 1, 2016  , the Company completed its acquisition of privately held CloudLock Inc. ("CloudLock"), a provider of cloud security that specializes in cloud access security broker technology that provides enterprises with visibility and analytics around user behavior and sensitive data in cloud services. Revenue from the CloudLock acquisition has been included in the Company's Security product category. 
  The total purchase consideration related to the Company s acquisitions completed during the three months ended   October 29, 2016   consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately   $1 million  . Total transaction costs related to the Company s acquisition activities were   $1 million

and   $5 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses ("G A") in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The Company s purchase price allocation for acquisitions completed during recent periods is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at that time was unknown to the Company may become known to the Company during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the acquisition occurred. 
  The goodwill generated from the Company s acquisitions completed during the   three months ended October 29, 2016   is primarily related to expected synergies. The goodwill is generally not deductible for income tax purposes. 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each acquisition from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisitions completed during the   three months ended October 29, 2016   have not been presented because the effects of the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to the Company s financial results.  

4.

              (a)

Purchased intangible assets include intangible assets acquired through acquisitions as well as through direct purchases or licenses.   
  Impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   were   $42 million  . Impairment charges were primarily as a result of declines in estimated fair values of certain purchased intangible assets resulting from the reduction or elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of the Company s technology and IPR D intangible assets. Of these impairment charges,   $38 million   was recorded to restructuring and other charges upon the Company's decision to exit certain product lines, and the corresponding elimination of future associated cash flows. There were   no   impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the corresponding period in fiscal 2016. 
  The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets (in millions):

    Restructuring and Other Charges 
     In August 2016, the Company announced a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2017 Plan") that will impact up to   5,500   employees, representing approximately   7%   of its global workforce. The Company's aggregate pretax estimated charges pursuant to the restructuring plan are expected to be up to   $700 million  , consisting primarily of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. These charges are primarily cash-based, and the Company expects the Fiscal 2017 Plan to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.  
  In connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2014 (the  Fiscal 2015 Plan ), the Company incurred cumulative charges of approximately   $756 million  . The Company completed the Fiscal 2015 Plan in fiscal 2016.

    Financing Receivables and Operating Leases  
              (a) 
    Financing Receivables  
     Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts and other. Lease receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the sale of the Company s and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of the Company s products and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of the Company s products and services. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of   four years   on average, while loan receivables generally have terms of up to   three years  . The financed service contracts and other category includes financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services, software, and receivables related to financing of certain indirect costs associated with leases. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from   one   to   three   years.  
  A summary of the Company's financing receivables is presented as follows (in millions): 

As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the deferred service revenue related to "Financed Service Contracts and Other" was   $2,371 million   and   $1,716 million  , respectively. 
  Future minimum lease payments to the Company on lease receivables as of   October 29, 2016   are summarized as follows (in millions): 

Actual cash collections may differ from the contractual maturities due to early customer buyouts, refinancings, or defaults.

(b) 
    Credit Quality of Financing Receivables 
     Gross receivables, excluding residual value, less unearned income categorized by the Company s internal credit risk rating as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   are summarized as follows (in millions):    

The Company determines the adequacy of its allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in its financing receivables by portfolio segment. The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by the Company to its customers, which consist of the following: lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts and other.   
  The Company s internal credit risk ratings of   1   through   4   correspond to investment-grade ratings, while credit risk ratings of   5   and   6   correspond to non-investment grade ratings. Credit risk ratings of   7   and higher correspond to substandard ratings.  
  In circumstances when collectibility is not deemed reasonably assured, the associated revenue is deferred in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policies, and the related allowance for credit loss, if any, is included in deferred revenue. The Company also records deferred revenue associated with financing receivables when there are remaining performance obligations, as it does for financed service contracts. Total allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   were   $2,779 million   and   $2,112 million  , respectively, and they were associated with total financing receivables before allowance for credit loss of   $9,711 million   and   $8,805 million   as of their respective period ends.  
  The following tables present the aging analysis of gross receivables, excluding residual value and less unearned income as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   (in millions):  

Past due financing receivables are those that are   31 days   or more past due according to their contractual payment terms.  The data in the preceding tables is presented by contract, and the aging classification of each contract is based on the oldest outstanding receivable, and therefore past due amounts also include unbilled and current receivables within the same contract.  The balances  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  
  CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited)  

of either unbilled or current financing receivables included in the category of 91 days plus past due for financing receivables were   $436 million   and   $670 million   as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had financing receivables of   $236 million  , net of unbilled or current receivables, that were in the category of 91 days plus past due but remained on accrual status as they are well secured and in the process of collection. Such balance was   $144 million   as of   July 30, 2016  . 
           (c) 
    Allowance for Credit Loss Rollforward  
     The allowances for credit loss and the related financing receivables are summarized as follows (in millions):  

The Company assesses the allowance for credit loss related to financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis.  The Company considers various factors in evaluating lease and loan receivables and the earned portion of financed service contracts for possible impairment on an individual basis. These factors include the Company s historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. When the evaluation indicates that it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the financing agreement, including scheduled interest payments, are unable to be collected, the financing receivable is considered impaired. All such outstanding amounts, including any accrued interest, will be assessed and fully reserved at the customer level. The Company s internal credit risk ratings are categorized as   1   through   10  , with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality financing receivables.  
  Typically, the Company also considers receivables with a risk rating of   8   or higher to be impaired and will include them in the individual assessment for allowance. These balances, as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , are presented under  (b) Credit Quality of Financing Receivables  above. 
  The Company evaluates the remainder of its financing receivables portfolio for impairment on a collective basis and records an allowance for credit loss at the portfolio segment level. When evaluating the financing receivables on a collective basis, the Company uses expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as its own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation. 
           (d) 
    Operating Leases 
     The Company provides financing of certain equipment through operating leases, and the amounts are included in property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts relating to equipment on operating lease assets and the associated accumulated depreciation are summarized as follows (in millions):

As of   October 29, 2016  , for fixed income securities that were in unrealized loss positions, the Company has determined that (i) it does not have the intent to sell any of these investments and (ii) it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. In addition, as of   October 29, 2016  , the Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such fixed income securities and has determined that   no   other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three months ended   October 29, 2016  .  
  The Company has evaluated its publicly traded equity securities as of   October 29, 2016   and has determined that there was   no   indication of other-than-temporary impairments in the respective categories of unrealized losses. This determination was based on several factors, which include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Company s intent and ability to hold the publicly traded equity securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
           (c) 
    Maturities of Fixed Income Securities 
     The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s fixed income securities as of   October 29, 2016   (in millions):    

Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. The remaining contractual principal maturities for mortgage-backed securities were allocated assuming no prepayments. 
           (d) 
    Securities Lending 
     The Company periodically engages in securities lending activities with certain of its available for sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015   was   $1.5 billion   and   $0.5 billion  , respectively. The Company requires collateral equal to at least   102%   of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. The Company engages in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify the Company against collateral losses. The Company did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding securities lending transactions.

    Investments in Privately Held Companies 
     The carrying value of the Company s investments in privately held companies was included in other assets.  For such investments that were accounted for under the equity and cost method as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the amounts are summarized in the following table (in millions): 

For additional information on impairment charges related to investments in privately held companies, see Note 9. 
  Variable Interest Entities    In the ordinary course of business, the Company has investments in privately held companies and provides financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. The Company evaluates on an ongoing basis its investments in these privately held companies and its customer financings, and has determined that as of   October 29, 2016  , except as disclosed in Note 1, there were   no   significant variable interest entities required to be consolidated in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  As discussed in Note 2, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard update related to the consolidation of certain types of legal entities. As of   October 29, 2016  , the carrying value of the Company's investments in privately held companies was   $991 million  , of which   $609 million   of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. In addition, the Company has additional funding commitments of   $189 million   related to these investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The carrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments collectively represent the Company's maximum exposure related to these variable interest entities. 

9. 
     Fair Value  
     Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
           (a) 
    Fair Value Hierarchy 
     The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 
  Level 1   applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2   applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
  Level 3   applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

    Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
     Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   were as follows (in millions): 

Level 1 publicly traded equity securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 fixed income securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets and liabilities. The Company uses such pricing data as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its investment portfolio and has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs. The Company is ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The Company s derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented. 
  Level 3 assets include certain derivative instruments, the values of which are determined based on discounted cash flow models using inputs that the Company could not corroborate with market data. 
           (c) 
    Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
     The following table presents the Company s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the indicated periods and the related recognized gains and losses for the periods indicated (in millions): 

These assets were measured at fair value due to events or circumstances the Company identified as having significant impact on their fair value during the respective periods. To arrive at the valuation of these assets, the Company considers any significant  
  
   21

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited)  

changes in the financial metrics and economic variables and also uses third-party valuation reports to assist in the valuation as necessary.  
  The fair value measurement of the impaired investments was classified as Level 3 because significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. Significant unobservable inputs, which included financial metrics of comparable private and public companies, financial condition and near-term prospects of the investees, recent financing activities of the investees, and the investees  capital structure as well as other economic variables, reflected the assumptions market participants would use in pricing these assets. The impairment charges, representing the difference between the net book value and the fair value as a result of the evaluation, were recorded to other income (loss), net. The remaining carrying value of the investments that were impaired was   $46 million   and   $6 million   as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively. 
  The fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to the use of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation.  Significant unobservable inputs that were used included expected revenues and net income related to the assets and the expected life of the assets. The difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets was recorded as an impairment charge, which was included in product cost of sales and operating expenses as applicable. See Note 4. The remaining carrying value of the specific purchased intangible assets that were impaired was   $11 million   and   zero   as of   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  .  
    
  (d)  Other Fair Value Disclosures  
  The carrying value of the Company s investments in privately held companies that were accounted for under the cost method was   $829 million   as of each of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  . It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of this portfolio. 
  The fair value of the Company s short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to their short duration. The aggregate carrying value of the Company s long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts and other as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   was   $3.3 billion   and   $2.6 billion  , respectively. The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts and other approximates their carrying value. The Company uses significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of its long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s senior notes and other long-term debt was   $36.5 billion   with a carrying amount of   $34.8 billion  . This compares to a fair value of   $30.9 billion   and a carrying amount of   $28.6 billion   as of   July 30, 2016  . The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  

(a) 
    Short-Term Debt 
     The following table summarizes the Company s short-term debt (in millions, except percentages):   

  The effective interest rate on the current portion of long-term debt includes the impact of interest rate swaps, as discussed further in "(b) Long-Term Debt." Other notes and borrowings consist of the short-term portion of secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. These notes and credit facilities were subject to various terms and foreign currency market interest rates pursuant to individual financial arrangements between the financing institution and the applicable foreign subsidiary.  
  The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to   $3.0 billion   through the issuance of commercial paper notes. The Company uses the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. The Company did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  .

    Long-Term Debt 
     The following table summarizes the Company s long-term debt (in millions, except percentages): 

(1)    In September 2016, the Company issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of   $6.25 billion  .  
  To achieve its interest rate risk management objectives, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in prior periods with an aggregate notional amount of   $9.9 billion   designated as fair value hedges of certain of its fixed-rate senior notes.  In effect, these swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates.  For additional information, see Note 11. 
  The effective rates for the fixed-rate debt include the interest on the notes, the accretion of the discount, and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes and payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by the Company at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.  
  The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that may be issued in the future pursuant to the Company s short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under  (a) Short-Term Debt.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company was     in compliance with all debt covenants. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , future principal payments for long-term debt, including the current portion, are summarized as follows (in millions): 

(c) 
    Credit Facility 
     On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a   $3.0 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on   May 15, 2020  . Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus   0.50%  , (b) Bank of America s  prime rate  as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent ( Eurocurrency Rate ), for an interest period of one-month plus   1.00%  , or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on the Company s senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard   Poor s Financial Services, LLC and Moody s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than   zero  .  The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.  
  The Company may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional   $2.0 billion   and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to   May 15, 2022  . As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and the Company had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.  

11. 
    Derivative Instruments  
              (a) 
    Summary of Derivative Instruments 
     The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks. The Company s primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. The Company s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company does, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties.

    Offsetting of Derivative Instruments 
     The Company presents its derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the Company s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company also enters into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Information related to these offsetting arrangements is summarized as follows (in millions):

(c) 
    Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
     The Company conducts business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts. The Company does not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes. 
  The Company hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward contracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than   24 months  . The Company assesses effectiveness based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives.  The effective portion of the derivative instrument s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. During the periods presented, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. 
  The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. 
  The Company hedges certain net investments in its foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company s net investment in those foreign subsidiaries.  
           (d) 
    Interest Rate Risk 
     Interest Rate Derivatives, Investments     The Company s primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. To realize these objectives, the Company may utilize interest rate swaps or other derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges. As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate derivatives related to its fixed income securities. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt    In the three months ended October 29, 2016, the Company did not enter into any interest rate swaps. In prior fiscal years, the Company entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2017     through 2025. Under these interest rate swaps, the Company receives fixed-rate interest payments and makes interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was reflected in other current assets and other assets.  
           (e) 
    Equity Price Risk  
     The Company may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify its overall investment portfolio. The publicly traded equity securities in the Company s portfolio are subject to price risk. To manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, the Company has periodically entered into equity derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in the value of the hedging instruments are included in other income (loss), net, and offset the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged investment. In addition, the Company periodically enters into equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are also included in other income (loss), net.  
  The Company is also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the Company utilizes derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure.  
           (f) 
    Hedge Effectiveness  
     For the periods presented, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were not material for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges. In addition, hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges was not material for any of the periods presented.

    Commitments and Contingencies  
              (a) 
    Operating Leases 
     The Company leases office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in   Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom  . The Company also leases equipment and vehicles. Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of   one   year as of   October 29, 2016   are as follows (in millions): 

(b) 
    Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers  
     The Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and uses several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for its products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company or establish the parameters defining the Company s requirements.  A significant portion of the Company s reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust the Company s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed.  As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the Company had total purchase commitments for inventory of   $3,920 million   and   $3,896 million  , respectively. 
  The Company records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of its future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of the Company s excess and obsolete inventory. As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , the liability for these purchase commitments was   $161 million   and   $159 million  , respectively, and was included in other current liabilities. 
           (c) 
    Other Commitments 
     In connection with the Company s acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or upon the continued employment with the Company of certain employees of the acquired entities.  
  The following table summarizes the compensation expense related to acquisitions (in millions): 

As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to   $299 million   may be required to be recognized pursuant to the applicable business combination agreements, which included the remaining potential compensation expense related to Insieme Networks, Inc. ("Insieme"), as more fully discussed immediately below.  
  Insieme Networks, Inc.        In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between the Company and Insieme, this investment included   $100 million   of funding and a license to certain of the Company s technology. Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, the Company owned approximately   83%   of Insieme as a result of these investments and has consolidated the results of Insieme in its Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, the Company and Insieme entered into a put/call option agreement that provided the Company with the right to purchase the

  (Unaudited)  

remaining interests in Insieme.  In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require the Company to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events.  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company exercised its call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme s products. The Company recorded compensation expense of   $20 million   and   $51 million   during the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or are expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting will result in additional compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Company has determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by the Company is approximately   $834 million   (which includes the   $803 million   that has been expensed to date), net of forfeitures. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately   $323 million   and   $291 million   during the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company paid a total of approximately   $712 million   pursuant to these two milestone payments.  
           (d) 
    Product Warranties 
     The following table summarizes the activity related to the product warranty liability (in millions): 

The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of its cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for technical support staff, and associated overhead. The Company s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from   90 days   to   five years  , and for some products the Company provides a limited lifetime warranty. 
           (e) 
    Financing and Other Guarantees 
     In the ordinary course of business, the Company provides financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners and end-user customers. Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented. 
  Channel Partner Financing Guarantees     The Company facilitates arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms ranging from   60   to   90 days  . These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, the Company guarantees a portion of these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was   $6.9 billion   for each of the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  . The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was   $1.0 billion   and   $1.1 billion   as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  End-User Financing Guarantees     The Company also provides financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to   three years  . The volume of financing provided by third parties for leases and loans as to which the Company had provided guarantees was   $6 million   and   $23 million   for the   three months ended October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively.

Financing Guarantee Summary     The aggregate amounts of financing guarantees outstanding at   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , representing the total maximum potential future payments under financing arrangements with third parties along with the related deferred revenue, are summarized in the following table (in millions): 

Other Guarantees     The Company s other guarantee arrangements as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   that were subject to recognition and disclosure requirements were not material. 
           (f) 
    Supplier Component Remediation Liability 
     The Company has recorded in other current liabilities a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These components were widely used across the industry and are included in a number of the Company's products. Defects in some of these components have caused products to fail after a power cycle event.  Defect rates due to this issue have been and are expected to be low. However, the Company has seen a small number of its customers experience a growing number of failures in their networks as a result of this component problem. Although the majority of these products were beyond the Company's warranty terms, the Company has been proactively working with customers on mitigation.  Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company had a liability of   $63 million   related to this issue for expected remediation costs based on the intended approach at that time. In February 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures described above, the Company decided to expand its approach, which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of   $655 million   being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, adjustments to product cost of sales of   $74 million   and   $164 million  , respectively, were recorded to reduce the liability, reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products. The supplier component remediation liability as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   was   $265 million   and   $276 million  , respectively. 
           (g) 
    Indemnifications 
     In the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold such parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  
  The Company has been asked to provide indemnification in matters involving certain of the Company s service provider customers that are subject to patent infringement claims asserted by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. in Kansas and Delaware. Sprint alleges that the service provider customers infringe Sprint s patents by offering VoIP telephone services utilizing products provided by the Company and other manufacturers. Sprint seeks monetary damages. Sprint s Kansas cases were stayed pending resolution of Sprint s appeal of the Delaware court s judgment that certain Sprint patents were invalid. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the Delaware court s judgment on September 23, 2016. As a result, Sprint s Kansas cases are set for trial on February 13 and March 6, 2017 against Time Warner Cable and Comcast respectively, and its Delaware case was reset for trial on November 6, 2017 against Cox Communications. 
  The Company believes that the service providers have strong defenses and arguments that the Company's products do not infringe the patents and/or that Sprint's patents are invalid.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process, which involves numerous defendants, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time.  Should Sprint prevail in litigation, mediation, or settlement, the Company, in accordance with its agreements, may have an obligation to

indemnify its service provider customers for damages, mediation awards, or settlement amounts arising from their use of Cisco products. At this time, the Company does not anticipate that the outcome of the matters would be material.  
  In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company s agents.  
  It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the Company s limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the Company s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. 
           (h) 
    Legal Proceedings 
     Brazil        Brazilian authorities have investigated the Company s Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of the Company s products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against the Company s Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. 
  The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities that remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to   $253 million   for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes,   $1.3 billion   for interest, and   $1.2 billion   for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of   October 29, 2016  . The Company has completed a thorough review of the matters and believes the asserted claims against the Company s Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and the Company is defending the claims vigorously. While the Company believes there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against its Brazilian subsidiary and is unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. The Company does not expect a final judicial determination for several years.  
  Backflip Software         Backflip Software, Inc. brought claims against the Company as disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K filed on September 8, 2016. Prior to the commencement of trial set for September 12, 2016, the parties executed a Settlement and Release Agreement resolving all aspects of the case and the Court dismissed the case in its entirety on   October 17, 2016  . The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. 
  SRI International         On   September 4, 2013  , SRI International, Inc. ( SRI ) asserted patent infringement claims against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing Cisco products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing   two   U.S. patents. SRI sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages. On   May 12, 2016  , the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents. The jury awarded SRI damages of   $23.7 million  , and the Court will decide whether to award enhanced damages and attorneys  fees and whether an ongoing royalty should be awarded through the expiration of the patents in 2018. In June 2016, the Company filed post-trial motions. The Company also intends to pursue an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on various grounds. The Company believes it has strong arguments to overturn the jury verdict and/or reduce the damages award. While the ultimate outcome of the case may still result in a loss, the Company does not expect it to be material. 
  SSL       SSL Services, LLC ( SSL ) has asserted claims for patent infringement against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The proceeding was instituted on   March 25, 2015  . SSL alleges that the Company's AnyConnect products that include Virtual Private Networking functions infringed a U.S. patent owned by SSL. SSL seeks money damages from the Company. On   August 18, 2015  , Cisco petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to review whether the patent SSL has asserted against the Company is valid over prior art. On   February 23, 2016  , a PTAB multi-judge panel found a reasonable likelihood that Cisco would prevail in showing that SSL s patent claims are unpatentable and instituted proceedings. The PTAB held a hearing to review the Company's petition on   November 15, 2016   and we are awaiting a decision. The district court issued an order on   June 28, 2016   staying the district court case pending the final written decision from the PTAB. The Company believes it has strong arguments that the Company's products do not infringe and the patent is invalid. If the Company does not prevail and a jury were to find that the Company's AnyConnect products infringe, the Company believes damages, as appropriately measured, would be immaterial. Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes, however, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time.

Kangtega         Cisco Systems GmbH ( Cisco GmbH ) is subject to patent claims by Kangtega GmbH ( Kangtega ), instituted on   June 6, 2013  , alleging that Cisco GmbH infringes in Germany a European Patent by marketing in Germany network intrusion-detection (or firewall) products known as the  ASA  firewall offering. On   April 29, 2014  , the Mannheim Regional Court dismissed the infringement action, finding no infringement by Cisco GmbH of the asserted patent. On   November 23, 2016  , a court of appeal in Germany (Oberlandesgericht Karlsruhe) will hear an appeal of that judgment. The matter had been set for   July 13, 2016  , but that hearing was postponed until   November 23, 2016.   In addition, on   July 25, 2016   the German Federal Patent Court issued its grounds for a     decision denying Cisco s nullity request with respect to the Kangtega patent. The nullity decision, which is open to appeal, regards patent validity and was issued in a separate proceeding from the infringement action in which Cisco has previously prevailed. In the infringement action, Kangtega seeks an injunction which would prohibit Cisco GmbH s activities in Germany with respect to the ASA firewall offering unless Cisco GmbH takes a license from Kangtega or the Company redesigns the products.  The Company believes that the lower court ruling in Cisco's favor in the infringement action was correct and should be affirmed.  The Company does not anticipate that the outcome of the case would be material. However, due to uncertainty surrounding the litigation process, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the outcome of the appeal and any subsequent appeals to a higher court at this time. 
  In addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

    Shareholders  Equity  
              (a) 
    Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock  
     During the   three months ended October 29, 2016  , the Company declared and paid cash dividends of   $0.26   per common share, or   $1.3 billion  , on the Company s outstanding common stock. During the   three months ended October 24, 2015  , the Company declared and paid cash dividends of   $0.21   per common share, or   $1.1 billion  , on the Company s outstanding common stock. 
  Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. 
           (b) 
    Stock Repurchase Program 
     In September 2001, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company s Board of Directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to   $112 billion   of common stock under this program, and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was   $14.4 billion  , with no termination date. A summary of the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): 

(1)    There were   $23 million   of stock repurchases pending settlement as of   October 29, 2016  . There were   $45 million   of stock repurchases that were pending settlement as of   July 30, 2016  . 
  The purchase price for the shares of the Company s stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders  equity. The Company is required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. 
           (c) 
    Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings 
     For the   three months ended October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , the Company repurchased approximately   13 million   and     15 million   shares, or   $401 million   and     $382 million  , of common stock, respectively, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or stock units.

    Employee Benefit Plans   
              (a) 
    Employee Stock Incentive Plans 
     Stock Incentive Plan Program Description      As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had   three   stock incentive plans: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2005 Plan  the Cisco Systems, Inc. SA Acquisition Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  SA Acquisition Plan  and the Cisco Systems, Inc. WebEx Acquisition Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  WebEx Acquisition Plan ). In addition, the Company has, in connection with the acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to the Company and provide incentives for them to remain with the Company.  The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of the Company, government regulations, and other factors. The Company s primary stock incentive plans are summarized as follows:  
  2005 Plan        As of   October 29, 2016  , the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan over its term was   694 million   shares, plus shares from the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, the SA Acquisition Plan, and the WebEx Acquisition Plan that are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled. If any awards granted under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, the unexercised or unsettled shares underlying the awards will again be available under the 2005 Plan. Starting November 19, 2013, shares withheld by the Company from an award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right to satisfy withholding tax liabilities resulting from such award will again be available for issuance, based on the fungible share ratio in effect on the date of grant. 
  Pursuant to an amendment approved by the Company s shareholders on November 12, 2009, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan is reduced by   1.5   shares for each share awarded as a stock grant or a stock unit, and any shares underlying awards outstanding under the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, the SA Acquisition Plan, and the WebEx Acquisition Plan that expire unexercised at the end of their maximum terms become available for reissuance under the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan permits the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), the vesting of which may be performance-based or market-based along with the requisite service requirement, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including employee directors and officers), consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-employee directors of the Company. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Plan have an exercise price of at least   100%   of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date and prior to November 12, 2009 have an expiration date no later than   nine years   from the grant date. The expiration date for stock options and stock appreciation rights granted subsequent to the amendment approved on November 12, 2009 shall be no later than   10 years   from the grant date.  
  The stock options will generally become exercisable for   20%   or   25%   of the option shares   one   year from the date of grant and then ratably over the following   48 months   or   36 months  , respectively. Time-based stock grants and time-based RSUs will generally vest with respect to   20%   or   25%   of the shares or share units covered by the grant annually over the vesting period. The majority of the performance-based and market-based RSUs vests at the end of the   three  -year requisite service period or earlier if the award recipient meets certain retirement eligibility conditions. Certain performance-based RSUs, that are based on the achievement of financial and/or non-financial operating goals, typically vest upon the achievement of milestones (and may require subsequent service periods), with overall vesting of the shares underlying the award ranging from   six   months to   three   years. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors has the discretion to use different vesting schedules. Stock appreciation rights may be awarded in combination with stock options or stock grants, and such awards shall provide that the stock appreciation rights will not be exercisable unless the related stock options or stock grants are forfeited. Stock grants may be awarded in combination with non-statutory stock options, and such awards may provide that the stock grants will be forfeited in the event that the related non-statutory stock options are exercised. 
  Acquisition Plans   In connection with the Company s acquisitions of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. ( Scientific-Atlanta ) and WebEx Communications, Inc. ( WebEx ), the Company adopted the SA Acquisition Plan and the WebEx Acquisition Plan, respectively, each effective upon completion of the applicable acquisition. These plans constitute assumptions, amendments, restatements, and renamings of the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan of Scientific-Atlanta and the WebEx Communications, Inc. Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, respectively. The plans permit the grant of stock options, stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates who had been employed by Scientific-Atlanta or its subsidiaries or WebEx or its subsidiaries, as applicable. As a result of the shareholder approval of the amendment and extension of the 2005 Plan, as of November 15, 2007, the Company will no longer make stock option grants or direct share issuances under either the SA Acquisition Plan or the WebEx Acquisition Plan.

(b) 
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
     The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which includes its subplan named the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together, the  Purchase Plan ), under which   621 million   shares of the Company s common stock have been reserved for issuance as of   October 29, 2016  . Eligible employees are offered shares through a   24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods  . Employees may purchase a limited number of shares of the Company s stock at a discount of up to   15%   of the lesser of the market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period.  The Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on   January 3, 2020  .   No   shares were issued under the Purchase Plan during each of the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  . As of   October 29, 2016  ,   123 million   shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
           (c) 
    Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense 
     Share-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and RSUs granted to employees. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions): 

As of   October 29, 2016  , the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was   $2.7 billion  , which is expected to be recognized over approximately   2.5   years on a weighted-average basis.  
           (d) 
    Share-Based Awards Available for Grant 
     A summary of share-based awards available for grant is as follows (in millions):   

  As reflected in the preceding table, for each share awarded as restricted stock or subject to a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, an equivalent of   1.5   shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance. For restricted stock units that were awarded with vesting contingent upon the achievement of future financial performance or market-based metrics, the maximum awards that can be achieved upon full vesting of such awards were reflected in the preceding table.

    Valuation of Employee Share-Based Awards 
     Time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs") that are based on the Company s financial performance metrics or non-financial operating goals are valued using the market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected dividends. On the date of grant, the Company estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return ("TSR") component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows: 

The PRSUs granted during the periods presented are contingent on the achievement of the Company s financial performance metrics, its comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals. For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally   50%   of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a   three  -year performance period. Generally, the remaining   50%   of the PRSUs are earned based on the Company s TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in   0%   to   150%   of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of the Company's financial performance metrics or its comparative market-based returns and   0%   to   100%   of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals.

The following table provides details of income taxes (in millions, except percentages): 

As of October 29, 2016, the Company had   $1.7 billion   of unrecognized tax benefit, of which   $1.3 billion  , if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate. The Company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters.  The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefits at   October 29, 2016   could be reduced by approximately   $150 million   in the next 12 months.

    Segment Information and Major Customers  
              (a) 
    Revenue and Gross Margin by Segment 
     The Company conducts business globally and is primarily managed on a geographic basis consisting of   three   segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. The Company s management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from its internal management system. Sales are attributed to a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. The Company does not allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to its segments in this internal management system because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. In addition, the Company does not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.  
  Summarized financial information by segment for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and     October 24, 2015  , based on the Company s internal management system and as utilized by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), is as follows (in millions): 

Revenue in the United States was   $6.6 billion   and   $6.9 billion   for the   three months ended October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , respectively.

  Employee equity share options, unvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

  OVERVIEW 
  Cisco designs and sells broad lines of products, provides services and delivers integrated solutions to develop and connect networks around the world. For over 30 years, we have helped our customers build networks and automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize information technology (IT) based products and services. In an increasingly connected world, Cisco is helping to transform businesses, governments and cities worldwide. Over time, we have expanded to new markets that are a natural extension of our core networking business, as the network has become the platform for delivering an ever-increasing portfolio of IT based products and services.   
  A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): 

(1)    During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our Service Provider Video Connected Devices business ( SP Video CPE Business ). As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. Includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of   $411 million   for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  In the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , our revenue decreased by   3%   (increased 1% not including revenue from the divested SP Video CPE products which had been included in the prior year period) as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  . Within total revenue, product revenue decreased   6%   while service revenue increased   7%  .  Total gross margin increased by   2.0   percentage points, driven by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business, partially offset by the negative impacts of pricing and product mix.  As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by   0.8   percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by   1.0   percentage points, driven by the increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016 and the factors discussed above. Diluted earnings per share decreased by   4%   from the prior year, driven by a   4%   decrease in net income.  
  Revenue from the Americas decreased by   $0.3 billion  , driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business which led to lower product revenue in the United States. EMEA revenue decreased by   $0.1 billion  , led by product revenue declines in the United Kingdom. Revenue in our APJC segment increased   $0.1 billion  , led by product revenue growth in Australia and Japan. We experienced revenue declines from many emerging countries, and in particular we experienced product revenue declines in the emerging countries of Mexico, Brazil and China of 31%, 10% and 2%, respectively. In the aggregate, the  BRICM  countries experienced product revenue decline of 8% despite increased product revenue in Russia and India of 10% and 2%, respectively.  
  From a customer market standpoint, in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   we experienced product revenue declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets, while the enterprise market experienced growth. The decline in the service provider market was driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business.  
  From a product category perspective, total company product revenue, not including SP Video CPE products in the prior year period, decreased   1%   year over year. This decrease was led by product revenue decrease in Switching products of   7%  . Product revenue from Collaboration and Data Center each decreased by a   3%   and product revenue from Service Provider Video (excluding the CPE Business from the prior year period) and Wireless products each decreased by   2%  .  Partially offsetting these decreases was product revenue growth in Security and NGN Routing, which grew by   11%   and   6%  , respectively. The decline in sales of our Switching products was primarily due to lower sales of switches used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio. We believe the decline in sales of Switching products used in campus environments was driven by uncertainty in the macro environment, which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape.  
  In summary, during the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , we experienced solid revenue growth in our Security, NGN Routing and our Services categories. In addition, we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we experienced increased weakness in our business momentum with respect to the service provider customer market and continuing weakness in emerging countries in the aggregate.  We continue to operate in a challenging environment with significant volatility and a highly competitive landscape. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made solid progress over the past year in our priority areas. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned.  At the same time, we are aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment.

Strategy and Focus Areas 
  We see our customers increasingly using technology and, specifically, networks to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and try to gain a competitive advantage. In this increasingly digital world, we believe data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The network also plays an increasingly important role in enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data, where there is a premium on security and speed. We believe this is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connects nearly everything that can be digitally connected. 
  To deliver on our strategy, we are focused on providing highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects highly distributed data that is globally dispersed across organizations. Together with our ecosystem of partners and developers, we will provide technology, services, and solutions we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale, security and agility.  
  For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 30, 2016  .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 30, 2016  , as updated as applicable in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. 
  Revenue Recognition  
  Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: 
             
    Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.   Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. 
                
    Delivery has occurred.   Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable. 
                
    The fee is fixed or determinable.   We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. 
                
    Collectibility is reasonably assured.   We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history. 
     In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met.  For hosting arrangements, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term.  
  The amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting.  Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605,   Revenue Recognition  , deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605,   Software-Revenue Recognition,   or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting.  
  As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during the first quarter of   fiscal 2017  , nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

We make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. 
  Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns 
  The allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

(1)      Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income. 
  The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. 
  The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation.  Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. 
  A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   was   $124 million   and   $126 million  , respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.  
  Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 
  Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. 
  We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of   October 29, 2016  , the liability for these purchase commitments was   $161 million  , compared with   $159 million   as of   July 30, 2016  , and was included in other current liabilities. 
  
   45 

     Table of Contents     
  CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Our provision for inventory was   $12 million   and   $27 million   for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  , respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was   $30 million   and   $41 million   for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  , respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast.  
  Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties 
  We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.  
  Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
  We have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. In February 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in Note 12 (f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we decided to expand our approach, which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recorded adjustments to product cost of sales of   $74 million   and   $164 million  , respectively to reduce the liability, reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products. Estimating this liability is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liability may be impacted. 
  Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. 
  If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of   $62.4 billion   as of   October 29, 2016  , compared with   $58.1 billion   as of   July 30, 2016  . Our fixed income investment portfolio as of   October 29, 2016   consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  As described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.

Our Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during the periods presented, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. 
  The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of   October 29, 2016  . Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  . 
  Other-than-Temporary Impairments  
  We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. 
  If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. 
  For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
  We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of   October 29, 2016  , our investments in privately held companies were   $991 million  , compared with   $1,003 million   as of   July 30, 2016  , and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $47 million and $17 million for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  , respectively. 
  Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments 
  Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. 
  The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   was   $26.8 billion   and   $26.6 billion  , respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first quarters of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  .

The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. 
  We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.  Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $42 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and there were no such impairment charges for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.  
  Income Taxes 
  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was   21.4%   and     22.5%     in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  , respectively.  
  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. 
  Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. 
  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

  Revenue 
  The following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): 

We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): 

Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  For the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , total revenue decreased by   3%  . Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased 1%. Product revenue decreased by   6%   in total, and decreased by 1% not including revenue from SP Video CPE products in the prior year period. Service revenue increased by   7%  .  Our total revenue increased in our APJC geographic segment, while revenue decreased in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments.      The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced an 8% product revenue decline, with declines in Mexico, Brazil and China, partially offset by increases in the other two BRICM countries.  
  We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Our revenue in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure.  
  In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.

Product Revenue by Segment 
  The following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): 

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business.  As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods.  SP Video CPE Business revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was   $411 million  . 
  Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
    
  Americas    
  The   8%   decrease in product revenue for the Americas segment was driven primarily by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We had $312 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 in this segment. The decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment reflected declines across all customer markets. In particular, the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was due to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. The product revenue decrease in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments, partially offset by higher sales to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 7% in the United States, 31% in Mexico, 10% in Brazil and 2% in Canada.   
    
  EMEA 
  The decrease in product revenue for the EMEA segment was driven primarily by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  We had $85 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Product revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by   5%  , led by significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and commercial markets. We experienced product revenue growth in the enterprise market. The decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 7% and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, decreased by 4%. 
    
  APJC 
  Product revenue in the APJC segment increased by   3%  , led by solid growth in the commercial and enterprise markets. These increases were partially offset by declines in the public sector and service provider markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 20% in Australia, 11% in Japan and 2% in India, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 2% in China. Product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by a $14 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our SP Video CPE Business.

Product Revenue by Groups of Similar Products 
  In addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Collaboration (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence, and conferencing); Data Center; Wireless; Security; Service Provider Video (infrastructure and software and solutions); and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of     emerging technology products and other networking products.  
  The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): 

(1)    Includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of   $411 million   for the   first quarter   of fiscal 2016.  
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period s presentation.   
  Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  Switching 
  The decrease in revenue in our Switching product category of   7%  , or   $293 million  , was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Switching products used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio.  We believe this was driven by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape.  
  In terms of subcategories, the decrease was driven by a 21%, or $256 million, decrease in revenue from our modular switches due primarily to lower sales of most of our Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and also due to lower sales of our Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by sales growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches.  We experienced a slight decrease in revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches of 1%, or $26 million, and a decrease of a 12%, or $11 million, in sales of storage products. Revenue from our LAN-fixed configuration switches decreased due primarily to lower sales of most of the Cisco Catalyst Series switches in this product category, partially offset by higher sales of the Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches and certain other products in this portfolio.

NGN Routing 
  Revenue in our NGN Routing product category increased by   6%  , or   $120 million  , driven by a 9%, or $88 million, increase in revenue from our high-end router products, an 8%, or $25 million increase in revenue from what we categorize as other NGN Routing products and a 1%, or $7 million, increase in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products. The increase in revenue from our high-end router products was driven by an increase in revenue from our Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) products, our Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS) products and our legacy high-end router products.  The increase in revenue from other NGN Routing products was due to increased revenue from cable access products.  Revenue from our midrange and low-end router products increased slightly, driven by higher sales of our Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) products partially offset by lower sales of certain of our access router products.  
    
  Collaboration 
  Revenue from our Collaboration product category decreased by   3%  , or   $34 million  , driven by decreases in sales from Cisco TelePresence and Unified Communications products partially offset by continued growth in Conferencing revenue. The decrease in Unified Communications revenue was driven by decreased revenue from phones partially offset by higher software revenue. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products declined due to lower revenue from endpoint products. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from WebEx, which we include as product revenue within this category. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category.  
    
  Data Center 
  The decrease in revenue in our Data Center product category of   3%  , or   $25 million  , was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets partially offset by growth in the enterprise market.  We believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending.  Additionally, we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems.  Both of these factors we believe adversely impacted the sales of this product category. 
    
  Wireless 
  Revenue in our Wireless product category decreased by   2%  , or   $14 million  , driven by a decrease in sales of our controller products, partially offset by the continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this product category and increased sales of our access point products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category. 
    
  Security 
  Revenue in our Security product category increased   11%  , or   $55 million  , driven by higher sales of advanced threat security, web security and unified threat management products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category. 
    
  Service Provider Video 
  The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of   61%  , or   $416 million  , was driven by a decrease in product sales of   $411 million   related to our SP Video CPE Business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
  Other Products 
  The increase in revenue in our Other Products category was due to increased revenue from our Internet of Things ( IoT ) products, driven by our Jasper acquisition and increased revenue from our cloud-related offerings.

Service Revenue by Segment 
  The following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): 

Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  Service revenue grew   7%  , with solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased 10% and worldwide advanced services revenue was flat. Technical support services revenue experienced solid growth across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, decreased slightly in Americas and EMEA geographic segments and was flat in the APJC segment.

Product Gross Margin 
  The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as compared with the corresponding prior year period:  

(1)        Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere. 
  Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  Product gross margin increased by   2.5   percentage points as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  . The increase in product gross margin was due to productivity improvements and the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin SP Video CPE Business. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. The various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. Product gross margin was also impacted to a lesser extent by an unfavorable mix of products sold. The mix impact was driven by negative mix impact within Cisco Unified Computing System products and an unfavorable mix within our NGN routing products. 
  Service Gross Margin 
  Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  Our service gross margin percentage increased by   0.2   percentage points as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016   due to higher sales volume, favorable mix and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. These benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and increased outside services costs.   
  Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.

Gross Margin by Segment 
  The following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): 

(1)      The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments.  
  Three Months Ended October 29, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended October 24, 2015 
  The Americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements.  Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was driven by an unfavorable mix within our NGN routing products, decreased revenue from our higher margin Switching products, and a negative mix impact within Cisco Unified Computing System products. 
  The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the SP Video CPE Business, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing.  
  Our APJC segment gross margin percentage increased primarily due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable impacts from pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix. The mix impact was driven primarily by an increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products in this geographic segment. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment. 
  The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.

Research and Development ( R D ), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative ( G A ) Expenses 
  R D, sales and marketing, and G A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): 

R D Expenses 
  R D expenses decreased for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , primarily due to lower discretionary spending, lower acquisition-related costs and lower contracted services, partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses and higher share-based compensation expense. 
  We continue to invest in R D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R D.  
    
  Sales and Marketing Expenses 
  Sales and marketing expenses decreased for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services and lower acquisition-related costs. Lower headcount related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions. 
    
  G A Expenses 
  G A expenses increased in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher discretionary spending and higher contracted services, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower acquisition-related costs. 
    
  Effect of Foreign Currency 
  In the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R D, sales and marketing, and G A expenses by approximately   $33 million  , or approximately   0.7%  , compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  .   
    
  Headcount 
  Our headcount as of   October 29, 2016   was 72,385, which represents a decrease of 1,326 employees in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as compared with the total headcount at the end of   fiscal 2016  . The decrease was  driven by our fiscal 2017 restructuring actions that began in the first quarter, partially offset by additional headcount primarily from our investments in key growth areas.

The decrease in share-based compensation expense in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , was due primarily to lower expense associated with accelerated and modified awards, partially offset by higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions.  
  Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets 
  The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets (in millions): 

Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , due to higher impairment charges and amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired. 
  Restructuring and Other Charges 
  In the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately   $411 million   which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by the restructuring action announced in August 2016. Our aggregate pretax estimated charges pursuant to the restructuring action are expected to be approximately   $700 million  , and we expect the restructuring action to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring action in our key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud.  As a result, the overall cost savings from the restructuring action are not expected to be material for future periods. 
  In the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately $141 million, net of $1 million credit to cost of sales, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by the restructuring action announced in August 2014. We completed this restructuring action in fiscal 2016.

Operating Income 
  The following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):   

  For the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , operating income decreased by   7%  , and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by   1.0   percentage points. These decreases were primarily due to the increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016.  

Interest and Other Income (Loss), Net 
  Interest Income (Expense), Net     The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): 

For the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , interest income increased compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio.  Interest expense in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , was higher driven by higher average debt balances and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and on interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes. 
  Other Income (Loss), Net       The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): 

The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , was primarily attributable to higher realized gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current periods as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities.   
  The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies.  
  The change in other gains (losses), net in the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , was driven by net favorable foreign exchange impacts and lower donation expenses, partially offset by impacts from equity derivatives.

Provision for Income Taxes  
  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.   
  The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of   21.4%   for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   compared with   22.5%   for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  , a net   1.1   percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate for the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   as compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  . The decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development ( R D ) tax credit on December 18, 2015 and increase in foreign income taxed at other than U.S. tax rates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources. 
  Balance Sheet and Cash Flows 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments    The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): 

The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first quarter of   fiscal 2017   was primarily driven by an increase in debt of   $6.2 billion   and cash provided by operating activities of   $2.7 billion  . These sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of   $1.3 billion   and repurchase of common stock of   $1.0 billion   under the stock repurchase program, the timing of settlements and change in fair value of investments of $0.6 billion, capital expenditures of   $0.3 billion   and net cash paid for acquisitions of   $0.3 billion  .  
  Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was   $60.6 billion   and   $59.8 billion   as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   was   $10.4 billion   and   $5.9 billion  , respectively.  
  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.   
  Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation       As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. 
  We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): 

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see  Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  in this report.

We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.  
  The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): 

Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.  
  Accounts Receivable, Net   The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): 

Our accounts receivable net, as of   October 29, 2016   decreased by approximately   18%  , as compared with the end of   fiscal 2016  , primarily due to the timing of service billings. 
  Inventory Supply Chain    The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): 

Inventory as of   October 29, 2016   decreased by   3%   from our inventory balance at the end of   fiscal 2016  , and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately   1%  .  On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of   fiscal 2016  . We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. 
  Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products. 
  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. 
  We record a liability, included in other current liabilities, for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. The purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year. 
  Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. 
  Financing Receivables and Guarantees   We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of   October 29, 2016  , our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): 

Financing Receivables      Financing receivables less unearned income increased by   10%   compared with the end of   fiscal 2016  . The change was due to a   26%   increase in financed service contracts and other and a   5%   increase     in loan receivables partially offset by a   2%   decrease in lease receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. 
  Financing Guarantees      In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.  
  The volume of channel partner financing was   $6.9 billion   for each of the first quarters of   fiscal 2017 and 2016  . These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was   $1.0 billion   and   $1.1 billion   as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees     The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met. 
  Borrowings 
  Senior Notes      The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): 

(1)    In September 2016, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $6.25 billion    
  Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of   October 29, 2016  . 
  Other Debt    Other debt  as of   July 30, 2016   included secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was   $1 million   as of   July 30, 2016  .

Commercial Paper    We established a short-term debt financing program of up to   $3.0 billion   through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  . 
  Credit Facility     On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America s  prime rate  as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent ( Eurocurrency Rate ), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard   Poor s Financial Services, LLC and Moody s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.   
  We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. We were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.  
  Deferred Revenue     The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): 

Deferred product revenue increased   12%   primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription businesses and, to a lesser extent, higher deferred revenue related to two-tier distributors. The portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% on a year over year to $3.8 billion as of October 29, 2016. Collaboration, Security, and Wireless are the key product category contributors of this product deferred revenue growth. The   2%   decrease in deferred service revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared with the end of fiscal 2016, reflected a typical seasonal decline as we tend to experience higher service initiations as well as renewals in our fiscal fourth quarter.  
  Contractual Obligations 
  Operating Leases     
  We lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in   Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom  . We also lease equipment and vehicles. The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of   October 29, 2016   were   $1.1 billion  . 
  Other Commitments 
  In connection with our acquisitions and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insieme Networks, Inc.      In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment included   $100 million   of funding and a license to certain of our technology. Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately   83%   of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events.  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme s products. During the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015  , we recorded compensation expense of   $20 million   and   $51 million  , respectively, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or are expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting will result in additional compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately   $834 million   (which includes the   $803 million   that has been expensed to date), net of forfeitures. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately   $323 million   and   $291 million   during the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we paid a total of approximately   $712 million   pursuant to these two milestone payments.  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities.  
  We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to these variable interest entities, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were   $189 million   as of   October 29, 2016  . 
  On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. 
  We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under  Financing Receivables and Guarantees.  
  Securities Lending 
  We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available for sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 24, 2015   was   $1.5 billion   and   $0.5 billion  , respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
  Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Fixed Income Securities    We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of   October 29, 2016  . Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of   October 29, 2016  . We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. 
  Financing Receivables    As of   October 29, 2016  , our financing receivables had a carrying value of   $9.3 billion  , compared with   $8.4 billion   as of   July 30, 2016  . As of   October 29, 2016  , a hypothetical 50 basis points ( BPS ) increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively.  
  Debt       As of   October 29, 2016  , we had   $34.7 billion   in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of   $3.9 billion   floating-rate notes and   $30.8 billion   fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was   $34.8 billion  , and the related fair value based on market prices was   $36.5 billion  . As of   October 29, 2016  , a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the   $9.9 billion   of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately   $0.7 billion  , respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.   
  Equity Price Risk 
  The fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard   Poor s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments. 
  Publicly Traded Equity Securities    The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of   October 29, 2016   and   July 30, 2016   are as follows (in millions):

     Table of Contents  

Investments in Privately Held Companies    We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of   October 29, 2016  , the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was   $991 million  , compared with   $1,003 million   at   July 30, 2016  . Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  Our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding as of respective period-ends are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): 

We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. 
  Approximately 65% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017  , foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R D, sales and marketing, and G A expenses by approximately   $33 million  , or approximately   0.7%  , compared with the   first quarter   of   fiscal 2016  .  To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales. 
  We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.

    Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   Based on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act )) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our   first quarter   of   fiscal 2017   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

Brazil       Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years.  
  The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities that remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to   $253 million   for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes,   $1.3 billion   for interest, and   $1.2 billion   for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of October 29, 2016. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. 
  Backflip Software       Backflip Software, Inc. brought claims against us as disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K filed on September 8, 2016. Prior to the commencement of trial set for September 12, 2016, the parties executed a Settlement and Release Agreement resolving all aspects of the case.and the Court dismissed the case in its entirety on October 17, 2016. The settlement did not have a material impact on our results of operations. 
  SRI International      On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. ( SRI ) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two U.S. patents. SRI sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages. On May 12, 2016, the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents. The jury awarded SRI damages of   $23.7 million   and the Court will decide whether to award enhanced damages and attorneys  fees and whether an ongoing royalty should be awarded through the expiration of the patents in 2018. In June 2016, we filed post-trial motions. We also intend to pursue an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on various grounds. We believe we have strong arguments to overturn the jury verdict and/or reduce the damages award. While the ultimate outcome of the case may still result in a loss, we do not expect it to be material. 
  SSL     SSL Services, LLC ( SSL ) has asserted claims for patent infringement against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The proceeding was instituted on March 25, 2015. SSL alleges that our AnyConnect products that include Virtual Private Networking functions infringed a U.S. patent owned by SSL. SSL seeks money damages from us. On August 18, 2015, Cisco petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to review whether the patent SSL has asserted against us is valid over prior art. On February 23, 2016, a PTAB multi-judge panel found a reasonable likelihood that Cisco would prevail in showing that SSL s patent claims are unpatentable and instituted proceedings. The PTAB held a hearing to review our petition on November 15, 2016 and we are awaiting a decision. The district court issued an order on June 28, 2016 staying the district court case pending the final written decision from the PTAB. We believe we have strong arguments that our products do not infringe and the patent is invalid. If we do not prevail and a jury were to find that our AnyConnect products  
  
   68 

     Table of Contents  

infringe, we believe damages, as appropriately measured, would be immaterial. Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes, however, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time.   
  Kangtega       Cisco Systems GmbH ( Cisco GmbH ) is subject to patent claims by Kangtega GmbH ( Kangtega ), instituted on June 6, 2013, alleging that Cisco GmbH infringes in Germany a European Patent by marketing in Germany network intrusion-detection (or firewall) products known as the  ASA  firewall offering. On April 29, 2014, the Mannheim Regional Court dismissed the infringement action finding no infringement by Cisco GmbH of the asserted patent. On November 23, 2016, a court of appeal in Germany (Oberlandesgericht Karlsruhe) will hear an appeal of that judgment. The matter had been set for July 13, 2016, but that hearing was postponed until November 23, 2016. In addition, on July 25, 2016, the German Federal Patent Court issued its grounds for a decision denying Cisco s nullity request with respect to the Kangtega patent. The nullity decision, which is open to appeal, regards patent validity and was issued in a separate proceeding from the infringement action in which Cisco has previously prevailed. In the infringement action, Kangtega seeks an injunction which would prohibit Cisco GmbH s activities in Germany with respect to the ASA firewall offering unless Cisco GmbH takes a license from Kangtega or Cisco redesigns the products. We believe the lower court ruling in Cisco s favor in the infringement action was correct and should be affirmed.  We do not anticipate that the outcome of the case would be material. However, due to uncertainty surrounding the litigation process, we are unable to reasonably estimate the outcome of the appeal and any subsequent appeals to a higher court at this time. 
  In addition, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see  Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors-We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others  herein.

    Risk Factors 

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The descriptions below include any material changes to and supersede the description of the risk factors affecting our business previously disclosed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   July 30, 2016  . 
  OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE  
  Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:     

Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment 

Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers  spending plans and associated revenue 

Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments 

Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions 

The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers 

The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new and evolving markets, including in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards 

New business models for our offerings, such as other-as-a-service, where costs are borne up front while revenue is recognized over time 

Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales 

The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers 

Manufacturing and customer lead times 

Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described below

As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.  
  OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT  
  Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: 

Reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well 

Increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products 

Risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

Risk of supply constraints 

Risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity 

Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense 

The global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent. Instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the recent United Kingdom  Brexit  referendum to withdraw from the European Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
  Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. For example, emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and also in fiscal 2015. 
  In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers  perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
  WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN KEY PRIORITY AND GROWTH AREAS AS WELL AS MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN ROUTING, SWITCHING AND SERVICES, AND IF THE RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS IS LOWER OR DEVELOPS MORE SLOWLY THAN WE EXPECT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE HARMED  
  We expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center, cloud and software, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. However, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.  
  OUR REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS  
  As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty.  
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  

Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2014 on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.  
  The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the United States and in emerging countries. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.  
  Inventory management remains an area of focus. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.  
  We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.  
  Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.  
  WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO VARY OVER TIME, AND OUR LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE  
  Although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our level of product gross margins have declined in certain prior periods and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors, including: 

Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group 

Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models for our offerings such as XaaS 

Our ability to reduce production costs 

Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development 

Sales discounts 

Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints 

Excess inventory and inventory holding charges 

Obsolescence charges 

Changes in shipment volume

The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals 

Increased cost, loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates 

Lower than expected benefits from value engineering 

Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China 

Changes in distribution channels 

Increased warranty costs 

Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions 

How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans 

Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.  
  SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND WEAKNESS IN ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as Data Center, Collaboration, and Service Provider Video, in addition to longer sales cycles.  Product orders from the service provider market decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2015, and at various times in the past, including in fiscal 2014, we experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers. 
  DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS  
  If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors  financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.  
  A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. If sales through indirect channels  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  

increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.  
  Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. Although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.  
  Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following: 

We compete with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them 

Some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear 

Some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions 

Revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors  financial condition or operations weaken 

In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels. 
  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF REVENUE GROWTH  
  The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.  
  As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. Our competitors include Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; ARRIS Group, Inc.; Avaya Inc.; Blue Jeans Networks, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Citrix Systems, Inc.; Dell Inc.; Extreme Networks, Inc.; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; International Business Machines Corporation; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; Microsoft Corporation; Nokia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; Polycom, Inc.; Riverbed Technology, Inc.; Symantec Corporation; Ubiquiti Networks and VMware, Inc.; among others.  
  Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase.  
  For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face  
  
   74 

     Table of Contents  

greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. 
  The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:                        

The ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services 

Product performance 

Price 

The ability to introduce new products, including products with price-performance advantages 

The ability to reduce production costs 

The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection 

Conformance to standards 

Market presence 

The ability to provide financing 

Disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.  
  OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS  
  We must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.  
  SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR COMPONENT SUPPLIERS, OR A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY THAT INCREASED OUR COSTS OR CAUSED A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ORDERS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND OUR FAILURE TO ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS  
  The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results: 

Any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs 

75 

     Table of Contents  

Reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs 

Industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, could either limit supply or increase costs 

A reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. We have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See the risk factor above entitled  Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.    
  Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.  
  We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future:     

New markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity 

As we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

We face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets 

Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.

     Table of Contents  

If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS  CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER  
  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. Many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made, and our architectural approach, are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of IT-based products and services. For example, several years ago we launched our Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS), our next-generation enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing, network, storage access and virtualization resources in a single system, which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center. While our Cisco UCS offering remains a significant focus area for us, several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments.  
  One such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks. We believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine ASICs, hardware and software elements together. Other examples include our focus on security; the market transition related to digital transformation and IoT; and the transition in cloud. 
  The process of developing new technology, including technology related to more programmable, flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud, is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers  changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on  white box  hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. 
  Our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected. Over the last few years, we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed. 
  Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products. 
  CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURINGS 
  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose  
  
   77 

     Table of Contents  

of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. 
  In August 2016, we announced a restructuring plan under which we began taking action in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  OVER THE LONG TERM WE INTEND TO INVEST IN ENGINEERING, SALES, SERVICE AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND THESE INVESTMENTS MAY ACHIEVE DELAYED, OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED, BENEFITS WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS  
  While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center, cloud, and software, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.  
  OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS  
  A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the Internet, including the continued development of the Internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution. To the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  Because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. Because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.  
  WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS  
  Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: 

Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products 

Diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions 

Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles 

Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

78 

     Table of Contents  

Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 

The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans 

Acquisitions may also cause us to:     

Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders  percentage ownership 

Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt 

Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition 

Assume liabilities 

Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges 

Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets 

Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R D cost sharing arrangement and legal structure 

Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses 

Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation 

Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.  
  From time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. See the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled  We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers  changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer  for additional information.  
  ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS  
  As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.  
  Further, provision of greater levels of services, support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS  
  There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants. 
    
  PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND NET INCOME  
  We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.  
  DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during the first quarter of fiscal 2017,  the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and also in fiscal 2015. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States; and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including, among others, the following:     

Foreign currency exchange rates 

Political or social unrest 

Economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including the current economic challenges in China and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of Brexit; environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries 

Political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns 

Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic 

Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

Adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations 

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES  
  Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. We expect demand for customer financing to continue, and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries.  
  We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.  
  Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.  
  In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers  ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS  
  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  Our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.  
  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS  
  Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.  
  
   81 

     Table of Contents  

Currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income.  
  OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE  
  We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.  
  WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS  
  Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 12(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
  Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.  
  WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES  
  Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.  
  OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION MAY OCCUR DUE TO PRODUCTION AND SALE OF COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS 
  As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to  
  
   82 

     Table of Contents  

block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. 
  OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET  
  Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on Internet product or service sales, and access charges for Internet service providers. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES  
  Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe that there may be future changes in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers  network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including "net neutrality" rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure. 
  Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES  
  Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future. 
  ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. For example, Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties.   The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007.   The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to   $253 million   for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes,   $1.3 billion   for interest, and   $1.2 billion   for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of   October 29, 2016  . We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While

     Table of Contents  

we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Item 1,  Legal Proceedings,  contained in Part II of this report.  
  CHANGES IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS  
  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R D cost sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  
  OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS  
  Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  
  MAN-MADE PROBLEMS SUCH AS CYBER-ATTACKS, DATA PROTECTION BREACHES, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, AND CYBER-ATTACKS OR DATA PROTECTION BREACHES ON OUR CUSTOMERS  NETWORKS, OR IN CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PROVIDED BY OR ENABLED BY US, COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR US, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS 
  Despite our implementation of network security measures, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers, data centers and the cloud-based solutions on which our data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error. Any such event could compromise our networks or those of our customers, and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance, and may not be successful.  Breaches of network security in our customers  networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in liability for us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.  
  In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.  
  
   84 

     Table of Contents  

To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH ALLIANCES AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  
  We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our Cisco Unified Computing System products. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.  
  OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE  
  Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.  
  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INCURRENCE OF DEBT  
  As of the end of the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017  , we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of   $34.7 billion   that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2017 through 2040. We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $3.0 billion  , and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of   October 29, 2016  .   The outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually, except   $3.9 billion   of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly. The fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. The instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we will be required to have available in the United States sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources, including cash currently held offshore. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.

    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (in millions, except per-share amounts): 

On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. As of   October 29, 2016  , our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to   $112 billion   of common stock under this program. As of   October 29, 2016  , we had repurchased and retired   4.6 billion   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $21.11   per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $97.6 billion   since inception of the stock repurchase program, and the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was   $14.4 billion   with no termination date. 
  For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

  The Committee may adopt such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan. The Committee s determinations under the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each member of the Committee, or of the Board, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (i) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan or any Stock Option Agreement, SAR Agreement, Stock Grant Agreement or Stock Unit Agreement, and (ii) from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company s approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf.

   (c) Restrictions on Shares. Any Shares issued pursuant to an Award shall be subject to such rights of repurchase, rights of first refusal and other transfer restrictions as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion. Such restrictions shall apply in addition to any restrictions that may apply to holders of Shares generally and shall also comply to the extent necessary with applicable law. In no event shall the Company be required to issue fractional Shares under this Plan. 
   
   (d) Beneficiaries. Unless stated otherwise in an Award agreement, a Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries with respect to an Award by timely filing the prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the Participant s death.

   (e) Performance Conditions. The Committee may, in its discretion, include performance conditions in an Award or grant an Award upon the satisfaction of performance conditions.

   4 

administered pursuant to the requirements of Code Section 162(m). Before any Shares underlying an Award or any Award payments subject to Performance Goals are released to a Covered Employee with respect to a Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing that the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have been satisfied. Awards with performance conditions that are granted to Key Employees who are not Covered Employees need not comply with the requirements of Code Section 162(m). 
   
   (f) No Rights as a Shareholder. A Participant, or a transferee of a Participant, shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Common Stock covered by an Award until such person has satisfied all of the terms and conditions to receive such Common Stock, has satisfied any applicable withholding or tax obligations relating to the Award and the Shares have been issued (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). 
   
   (g) Termination of Service. Unless the applicable Award agreement or, with respect to Participants who reside in the U.S., the applicable employment agreement provides otherwise, the following rules shall govern the vesting, exercisability and term of outstanding Awards held by a Participant in the event of termination of such Participant s Service (in all cases subject to the expiration term of the Option or SAR as applicable): (i) upon termination of Service for any reason, all unvested portions of any outstanding Awards shall be immediately forfeited without consideration and the vested portions of any outstanding Stock Units shall be settled upon termination; (ii) if the Service of a Participant is terminated for Cause, then all unexercised Options and SARs, unvested portions of Stock Units and unvested portions of Stock Grants shall terminate and be forfeited immediately without consideration; (iii) if the Service of a Participant is terminated for any reason other than for Cause, death, or Disability, then the vested portion of his or her then-outstanding Options and/or SARs may be exercised by such Participant or his or her personal representative within three months after the date of such termination; or (iv) if the Service of a Participant is terminated due to death or Disability, the vested portion of his or her then-outstanding Options and/or SARs may be exercised within eighteen months after the date of termination of Service. 
   
   (h) Director Fees. Each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive a Stock Grant or Stock Unit under the Plan in lieu of payment of a portion of his or her regular annual retainer based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date any regular annual retainer would otherwise be paid. For purposes of the Plan, a Non-Employee Director s regular annual retainer shall not include any additional retainer paid in connection with service on any committee of the Board or paid for any other reason. Such an election may be for any dollar or percentage amount equal to at least 25% of the Non-Employee Director s regular annual retainer (up to a limit of 100% of the Non-Employee Director s regular annual retainer). The election must be made prior to the beginning of the annual board of directors cycle which shall be any twelve month continuous period designated by the Board. Any amount of the regular annual retainer not elected to be received as a Stock Grant or Stock Unit shall be payable in cash in accordance with the Company s standard payment procedures. Shares granted under this Section 4(h) shall otherwise be subject to the terms of the Plan applicable to Non-Employee Directors or to Participants generally (other than provisions specifically applying only to Employees). 
   
   SECTION 5.     SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN AND SHARE LIMITS  . 
   
   (a) Basic Limitations. The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued Shares.  The aggregate number of Shares reserved for Awards under the Plan shall not exceed 694,000,000 Shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11.  Shares issued as Stock Grants, pursuant to Stock Units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents will count against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan as 1.5 Shares for every 1 Share issued in connection with the Award or dividend equivalent.  
   
  (b) Additional Shares. If Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, then the Shares underlying such Awards, plus the number of additional Shares, if any, that counted against Shares available for issuance under the Plan in respect thereof at the time of Grant, shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. If a Previous Plan Award is forfeited or is terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, then the Shares underlying such Previous Plan Award shall again become available for Awards under this Plan. SARs shall be counted in full against the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, regardless of the number of Shares issued upon settlement of the SARs. In the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from an Award other than an Option or SAR are satisfied by the withholding of Shares by the Company, then the Shares so withheld, plus the number of additional Shares, if any, that counted against Shares available for issuance under the Plan in respect thereof at the time of Grant, shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. In the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from an Option or SAR are satisfied by the withholding of Shares by the Company, then the Shares so withheld shall not be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan. In addition, Shares that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with the exercise or settlement of an Option or SAR shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan and Shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an Option exercise shall not again be made available for issuance under the Plan. 
   
   (c) Dividend Equivalents. Any dividend equivalents settled in Shares under the Plan shall be applied against the number of Shares available for Awards. 
   
   (d) Share Limits. 
  (i) Limits on Options. Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11, no Key Employee shall receive Options to purchase Shares during any Fiscal Year covering in excess of 5,000,000 Shares and the aggregate maximum number of Shares that may be issued in connection with ISOs shall be 694,000,000 Shares. 
  (ii) Limits on SARs. Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11, no Key Employee shall receive Awards of SARs during any Fiscal Year covering in excess of 5,000,000 Shares and the aggregate maximum number of Shares that may be issued in connection with SARs shall be 694,000,000 Shares.    
  
   5 

(iii) Limits on Stock Grants and Stock Units. Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11, no Key Employee shall receive Stock Grants or Stock Units during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 5,000,000 Shares. 
  (iv) Limits on Awards to Non-Employee Directors. Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11, no Non-Employee Director shall receive Awards during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 50,000 Shares; provided that any Shares received pursuant to an election under Section 4(h) shall not count against such limit. 
   
   SECTION 6.     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS  . 
   
   (a) Stock Option Agreement. Each Grant of an Option under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Option Agreement between the Optionee and the Company. Such Option shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in a Stock Option Agreement (including without limitation any performance conditions). The provisions of the various Stock Option Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify whether the Option is an ISO or an NSO. 
   
   (b) Number of Shares. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the number of Shares that are subject to the Option and shall be subject to adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 11. 
   
   (c) Exercise Price. An Option s Exercise Price shall be established by the Committee and set forth in a Stock Option Agreement. The Exercise Price of an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value (110% for ISO grants to 10-Percent Shareholders) on the date of Grant. 
   
   (d) Exercisability and Term. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the Option is to become exercisable. The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify the term of the Option; provided that the term of an Option shall in no event exceed ten years from the date of Grant. Unless the applicable Stock Option Agreement provides otherwise, each Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 20% of the Shares subject to the Option upon completion of one year of Service measured from the vesting commencement date, the balance of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest and become exercisable in forty-eight equal installments upon completion of each month of Service thereafter, and the term of the Option shall be ten years from the date of Grant. A Stock Option Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant s death, Disability, or other events. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no Option can be exercised after the expiration date provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement and no Option may provide that, upon exercise of the Option, a new Option will automatically be granted. 

(e) Modifications or Assumption of Options. Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding options or may accept the cancellation of outstanding options (whether granted by the Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Options for the same or a different number of Shares, at the same or a different Exercise Price, and with the same or different vesting provisions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may not Re-Price outstanding Options unless there is approval by the Company shareholders and, unless a modification is necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule, such modification of an Option shall not, without the consent of the Optionee, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Option. 
   
   (f) Assignment or Transfer of Options. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement and then only to the extent permitted by applicable law, no Option shall be transferable by the Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement, an Option may be exercised during the lifetime  
  of the Optionee only by the Optionee or by the guardian or legal representative of the Optionee. No Option or interest therein may be assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Optionee during his or her lifetime, whether by operation of law or otherwise, or be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process. 
   
   SECTION 7.     PAYMENT FOR OPTION SHARES  . 
  The entire Exercise Price of Shares issued upon exercise of Options shall be payable in cash at the time when such Shares are purchased, except as follows and if so provided for in an applicable Stock Option Agreement: 
  (i) Surrender of Stock. Payment for all or any part of the Exercise Price or Options may be made with Shares which have already been owned by the Optionee; provided that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, require that Shares tendered for payment be previously held by the Optionee for a minimum duration. Such Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value. 
  (ii) Cashless Exercise. Payment for all or any part of the Exercise Price may be made through Cashless Exercise at the Committee s sole discretion. 
  (iii) Other Forms of Payment. Payment for all or any part of the Exercise Price may be made in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules and approved by the Committee. 
  In the case of an ISO granted under the Plan, payment shall be made only pursuant to the express provisions of the applicable Stock Option Agreement. The Stock Option Agreement may specify that payment may be made in any form(s) described in this Section 7. In the case of an NSO granted under the Plan, the Committee may, in its discretion at any time, accept payment in any form(s) described in this Section 7.

SECTION 8.     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS  . 
   
   (a) SAR Agreement. Each Grant of a SAR under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a SAR Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such SAR shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in a SAR Agreement (including without limitation any performance conditions). A SAR Agreement may provide for a maximum limit on the amount of any payout notwithstanding the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. The provisions of the various SAR Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. SARs may be granted in consideration of a reduction in the Participant s compensation. 
   
   (b) Number of Shares. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains and shall be subject to adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 11. 
   
   (c) Exercise Price. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price which shall be established by the Committee. The Exercise Price of a SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of Grant. 
   
   (d) Exercisability and Term. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the SAR is to become exercisable. The SAR Agreement shall also specify the term of the SAR which shall not exceed ten years from the date of Grant. Unless the applicable SAR Agreement provides otherwise, each SAR shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 20% of the Shares subject to the SAR upon completion of one year of Service measured from the vesting commencement date, the balance of the Shares subject to the SAR shall vest and become exercisable in forty-eight equal installments upon completion of each month of Service thereafter, and the term of the SAR shall be ten years from the date of Grant. A SAR Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant s death, Disability, or other events. SARs may be awarded in combination with Options or Stock Grants, and such an Award shall provide that the SARs will not be exercisable unless the related Options or Stock Grants are forfeited. A SAR may be included in an ISO only at the time of Grant but may be included in an NSO at the time of Grant or at any subsequent time, but not later than six months before the expiration of such NSO. No SAR may provide that, upon exercise of the SAR, a new SAR will automatically be granted. 
   
   (e) Exercise of SARs. If, on the date when a SAR expires, the Exercise Price under such SAR is less than the Fair Market Value on such date but any portion of such SAR has not been exercised or surrendered, then such SAR shall automatically be deemed to be exercised as of such date with respect to such portion. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR) shall receive from the Company (i) Shares, (ii) cash or (iii) any combination of Shares and cash, as the Committee shall determine at the time of Grant of the SAR, in its sole discretion. The amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on the date of exercise) of the Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the Exercise Price of those Shares. 
   
   (f) Modification or Assumption of SARs. Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding stock appreciation rights or may accept the cancellation of outstanding stock appreciation rights (including stock appreciation rights granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new SARs for the same or a different number of Shares, at the same or a different Exercise Price, and with the same or different vesting provisions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may not Re-Price outstanding SARs unless there is approval by the Company shareholders and, unless a modification is necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule, such modification of a SAR shall not  ,   without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or obligations under such SAR. 
   
   (g) Assignment or Transfer of SARs. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable SAR Agreement and then only to the extent permitted by applicable law, no SAR shall be transferable by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable SAR Agreement, a SAR may be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant or by the guardian or legal representative of the Participant. No SAR or interest therein may be assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Participant during his or her lifetime, whether by operation of law or otherwise, or be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process. 
   
   SECTION 9.     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK GRANTS  . 
   
   (a) Amount and Form of Awards. Awards under this Section 9 may be granted in the form of a Stock Grant. Each Stock Grant Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the Stock Grant pertains and shall be subject to adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 11. A Stock Grant may also be awarded in combination with NSOs, and such an Award may provide that the Stock Grant will be forfeited in the event that the related NSOs are exercised.  
   
  (b) Stock Grant Agreement. Each Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Grant Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Each Stock Grant shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement (including without limitation any performance conditions). The provisions of the various Stock Grant Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 
  
   7 

(c) Payment for Stock Grants. Stock Grants may be issued with or without cash consideration or any other form of legally permissible consideration approved by the Committee. 
   
   (d) Vesting Conditions. Each Stock Grant may or may not be subject to vesting. Any such vesting provision may provide that Shares shall vest based on Service over time or shall vest, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of performance conditions specified in the Stock Grant Agreement which may include Performance Goals pursuant to Section 4(e). Unless the applicable Stock Grant Agreement provides otherwise, each Stock Grant shall vest with respect to 20% of the Shares subject to the Stock Grant upon completion of each year of Service on each of the first through fifth annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date. A Stock Grant Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant s death, Disability, or other events. 
   
   (e) Assignment or Transfer of Stock Grants. Except as provided in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement, and then only to the extent permitted by applicable law, a Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Section 9(e) shall be void. However, this Section 9(e) shall not preclude a Participant from designating a beneficiary who will receive any vested outstanding Stock Grant Awards in the event of the Participant s death, nor shall it preclude a transfer of vested Stock Grant Awards by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
   
   (f) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holder of a Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company s other shareholders. A Stock Grant Agreement, however, may require that the holder of such Stock Grant invest any cash dividends received in additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant. Such additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Grant with respect to which the dividends were paid. Such additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant shall not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under Section 5. 
   
   (g) Modification or Assumption of Stock Grants. Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify or assume outstanding stock grants or may accept the cancellation of outstanding stock grants (including stock granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Stock Grants for the same or a different number of Shares and with the same or different vesting provisions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may not modify an outstanding Stock Grant such that the modification shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Stock Grant, unless such modification is necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule.  
   
   SECTION 10.     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK UNITS  .  
   
   (a) Stock Unit Agreement. Each grant of Stock Units under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Unit Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Unit Agreement (including without limitation any performance conditions). The provisions of the various Stock Unit Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. Stock Units may be granted in consideration of a reduction in the Participant s other compensation. 
   
   (b) Number of Shares. Each Stock Unit Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the Stock Unit Grant pertains and shall be subject to adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 11. 
   
   (c) Payment for Stock Units. Stock Units shall be issued without consideration. 
   
   (d) Vesting Conditions. Each Award of Stock Units may or may not be subject to vesting. Any such vesting provision may provide that Shares shall vest based on Service over time or shall vest, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of performance conditions specified in the Stock Unit Agreement which may include Performance Goals pursuant to Section 4(e). Unless the applicable Stock Unit Agreement provides otherwise, each Stock Unit shall vest with respect to 20% of the Shares subject to the Stock Unit upon completion of each year of Service on each of the first through fifth annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date. A Stock Unit Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant s death, Disability, or other events. 
   
   (e) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of Stock Units shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Stock Unit awarded under the Plan may, at the Committee s discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Stock Units. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both. Prior to distribution, any dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Units to which they attach and may not be paid until the applicable conditions and restrictions, including any performance conditions, are satisfied. 
   
   (f) Form and Time of Settlement of Stock Units. Settlement of vested Stock Units may be made in the form of (a) cash, (b) Shares or (c) any combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Stock Units, in its sole discretion. Methods of converting Stock Units into cash may include (without limitation) a method based on the average Fair Market Value of Shares over a series of trading days. Vested Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The distribution may occur or commence when the vesting conditions applicable to the Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or it may be deferred, in accordance with applicable law, to any later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents. Until an Award of Stock Units is settled, the number of such Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11. 
  
   8 

(g) Creditors  Rights. A holder of Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Unit Agreement. 
   (h) Modification or Assumption of Stock Units. Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify or assume outstanding stock units or may accept the cancellation of outstanding stock units (including stock units granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Stock Units for the same or a different number of Shares and with the same or different vesting provisions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may not modify an outstanding Stock Unit such that the modification shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Stock Unit, unless such modification is necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. 
   (i) Assignment or Transfer of Stock Units. Except as provided in the applicable Stock Unit Agreement, and then only to the extent permitted by applicable law, Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Section 10(i) shall be void. However, this Section 10(i) shall not preclude a Participant from designating a beneficiary who will receive any outstanding vested Stock Units in the event of the Participant s death, nor shall it preclude a transfer of vested Stock Units by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
   
   SECTION 11.     PROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION  . 
   (a) Adjustments. In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to the following: 
  (i) the number of Shares and the kind of shares or securities available for future Awards under Section 5; 
  (ii) the limits on Awards specified in Section 5; 
    
  (iii) the number of Shares and the kind of shares or securities covered by each outstanding Award; or 
  (iv) the Exercise Price under each outstanding SAR or Option. 
   (b) Participant Rights. Except as provided in this Section 11, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by the Company of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. If by reason of an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11 a Participant s Award covers additional or different shares of stock or securities, then such additional or different shares and the Award in respect thereof shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Award and the Shares subject to the Award prior to such adjustment. 
   (c) Fractional Shares. Any adjustment of Shares pursuant to this Section 11 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Shares. Under no circumstances shall the Company be required to authorize or issue fractional shares and no consideration shall be provided as a result of any fractional shares not being issued or authorized. 
   SECTION 12.     EFFECT OF A CORPORATE TRANSACTION  . 
   (a) Corporate Transaction. In the event that the Company is a party to a Corporate Transaction, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the applicable agreement of merger, reorganization, or sale of assets. Such agreement may provide, without limitation, for the assumption or substitution of outstanding Options, SARs, or Stock Units by the surviving corporation or its parent, for the assumption of outstanding Stock Grant Agreements by the surviving corporation or its parent, for the replacement of outstanding Options, SARs, and Stock Units with a cash incentive program of the surviving corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested portions of such outstanding Awards at the time of the transaction and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same vesting provisions applicable to those Awards, for accelerated vesting of outstanding Awards, or for the cancellation of outstanding Options, SARs, and Stock Units, with or without consideration, in all cases without the consent of the Participant. 
   (b) Acceleration. The Committee may determine, at the time of grant of an Award or thereafter, that such Award shall become fully vested as to all Shares subject to such Award in the event that a Corporate Transaction or a Change in Control occurs. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award agreement, in the event that a Corporate Transaction occurs and any outstanding Options, SARs or Stock Units are not assumed, substituted, or replaced with a cash incentive program pursuant to Section 12(a) or any outstanding Stock Grant Agreements are not assumed pursuant to Section 12(a), then such Awards shall fully vest and be fully exercisable immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction. Immediately following the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Units shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent that they are assumed by the surviving corporation or its parent. 
   (c) Dissolution. To the extent not previously exercised or settled, Options, SARs and Stock Units shall terminate immediately prior to the dissolution or liquidation of the Company. 
  
   9 

SECTION 13.     LIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS  . 
   (a) No Entitlements. A Participant s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award is derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards. Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participant s salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose. 
  Neither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain an employee, consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate. The Company and its Parents and Subsidiaries and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the Service of any person at any time, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and a written employment agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award. 
   (b) Shareholders  Rights. A Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Award prior to the issuance of such Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date when such Shares are issued, except as expressly provided in Section 11. 
   (c) Regulatory Requirements. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Shares or other securities under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and such approval by any regulatory body as may be required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in part, the delivery of Shares or other securities pursuant to any Award prior to the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such Shares or other securities, to     their registration, qualification or listing or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing. 
   SECTION 14.     WITHHOLDING TAXES  . 
   (a) General. A Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with his or her Award. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied. 
   (b) Share Withholding. If a public market for the Company s Shares exists, the Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her withholding or income tax obligations by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her or by surrendering or attesting to all or a portion of any Shares that he or she previously acquired. Such Shares shall be valued based on the value of the actual trade or, if there is none, the Fair Market Value as of the previous day. Any payment of taxes by assigning Shares to the Company may be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any restrictions required by rules of the SEC. The Committee may, in its discretion, also permit a Participant to satisfy withholding or income tax obligations related to an Award through Cashless Exercise or through a sale of Shares underlying the Award. 
   SECTION 15.     DURATION AND AMENDMENTS  . 
   (a) Term of the Plan. To the extent the Board approves an amendment to the Plan that requires shareholder approval, the amendment to the Plan shall become effective upon its approval by Company shareholders. The Plan shall terminate at the Company s 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and may be terminated on any earlier date pursuant to this Section 15. 
   (b) Right to Amend or Terminate the Plan. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason. The termination of the Plan, or any amendment thereof, shall not impair the rights or obligations of any Participant under any Award previously granted under the Plan without the Participant s consent, unless such modification is necessary or desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the Plan s termination. An amendment of the Plan shall be subject to the approval of the Company s shareholders only to the extent such approval is otherwise required by applicable laws, regulations or rules.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT 
  Recitals 
  A.    The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, non-employee members of the Board and Consultants. 
  B.    Optionee is to render valuable services to the Company (or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Company s grant of an option to Optionee. 
  C.    All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in this Agreement, the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the  Notice ), or the Plan. 
  NOW, THEREFORE  , it is hereby agreed as follows: 
  1.      Grant of Option  .  The Company hereby grants to Optionee, as of the grant date, as set forth in the Notice, (the  Grant Date ) an option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Notice.  The Option Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the Option term specified in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price specified in the Notice. 
  2.      Option Term  .  This Option shall have a maximum term of __________ years [not to exceed ten (10) years] measured from  

the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 4, 5 or 6. 
  3.      Non-Transferability  .     This Option shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Optionee die while holding this Option, then this Option shall be transferred in accordance with Optionee s will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
  4.      Dates of Exercise  .  This Option shall vest and become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as specified in the Notice.  As the Option becomes exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate and the Option shall remain exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Option term under Paragraph 5 or 6.  As an administrative matter, the exercisable portion of this Option may only be exercised until the close of the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the Expiration Date or the earlier termination date under Paragraph 5 or 6 or, if such date is not a trading day on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the last trading day before such date.  Any later attempt to exercise this Option will not be honored.  For example, if Optionee ceases to remain in Service as provided in Paragraph 5(i) and the date three (3) months from the date of cessation is Monday, July 4 (a holiday on which the Nasdaq Global Select Market is closed), Optionee must exercise the exercisable portion of this Option by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Friday, July 1. 
  5.      Cessation of Service  .  The Option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this Option shall cease to be outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions become applicable: 
  (i)    Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Disability or Cause and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of three (3) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (ii)    If Optionee dies while this Option is outstanding, then the Optionee s designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary was designated or properly designated or, if no designated beneficiary survives the Optionee, the Optionee s estate (to the extent reasonably determinable) or other individual or entity entitled to receive the Option under applicable local law shall have the right to exercise this Option.  Such right shall lapse, and this Option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (A) the expiration of the eighteen (18) month period measured from the date of Optionee s death or (B) the Expiration Date.  Optionee may only make a beneficiary designation with respect to this Option if the Company has approved a process or procedure for such beneficiary designation for the local jurisdiction within which Optionee performs services for the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  If no such beneficiary designation process or procedure has been approved by the Company, then, in the event of Optionee s death, this Option may only be exercised by the Optionee s estate (to the extent reasonably determinable) or other individual or entity entitled to receive the Option under applicable local law. 
  (iii)    Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Disability while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of eighteen (18) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (iv)    During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this Option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested Option Shares for which the Option is exercisable at the date the Optionee ceases to actively provide Service (not extended by any notice period mandated under local law).  Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares for which the Option has not been exercised.  However, this Option shall, immediately as of the date the Optionee ceases to actively provide Service for any reason, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any Option Shares in which Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested or for which this Option is not otherwise at that time exercisable. 
  (v)    Should Optionee s Service be terminated for Cause or should Optionee otherwise engage in activities constituting Cause while this Option is outstanding, then this Option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding.  In the event Optionee s Service is suspended pending an investigation of whether Optionee s Service will be terminated for Cause, all Optionee s rights under the Option, including the right to exercise the Option, shall be suspended during the investigation period. 
    
  (vi)    For purposes of this Paragraph 5, in the event of Optionee s cessation of Service, Optionee s right to receive additional options or to vest in the Option will end as of the date the Optionee is no longer actively providing Service and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (  e.g  ., active Service would not include any period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when an Optionee is no longer actively providing Service for purposes of this Option. 

6.      Special Acceleration of Option  . 
    
  (a)    This Option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this Option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become vested and exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested Shares.  No such acceleration of this Option, however, shall occur if and to the extent:  (i) this Option is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) this Option is replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested Option Shares at the time of the Corporate Transaction (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such Shares) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the same Exercise Schedule set forth in the Notice.  The determination of option comparability under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
    
  (b)    Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c)    If this Option is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of shares and the kind of shares or securities covered by the Option and the Exercise Price immediately after such Corporate Transaction, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. 
  (d)    This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
  7.      Adjustment in Option Shares  .  In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or kind of shares or securities subject to this Option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. 
  8.      Shareholder Rights  .  The holder of this Option shall not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the Option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased Shares. 
    
  9.      Manner of Exercising Option  . 
    
  (a)    In order to exercise this Option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this Option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the Option) must take the following actions: 
  (i)    Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased Shares in one or more of the following forms: 
  (A)    cash or check which, in the Company s sole discretion, shall be made payable to a Company-designated brokerage firm or the Company; and 
  (B)    as permitted by applicable law, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the Option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (I) to a Company-designated brokerage firm (or in the case of an executive officer or Board member of the Company, an Optionee-designated brokerage firm) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased Shares plus, if applicable, the amount necessary to satisfy the Company s (or a Parent s, Subsidiary s or Affiliate s) withholding obligations (including income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax items related to Optionee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Optionee ( Tax-Related Items )) and (II) to the Company to deliver the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction.  
  (ii)    Furnish to the Company appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the Option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this Option. 
  (iii)    Make appropriate arrangements with the Company (or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all withholding or other obligations related to Tax-Related Items applicable to the Option grant, vesting, exercise or the sale of Shares, as applicable.   
  (b)    As soon as practical after the exercise date, the Company shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this Option) the purchased Option Shares, (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly  

authorized transfer agent of the Company), subject to the appropriate legends and/or stop transfer instructions. 
  (c)    In no event may this Option be exercised for any fractional Shares. 
  (d)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, this Agreement or any other agreement to the contrary, if at the time this Option is exercised, Optionee is indebted to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) for any reason, the following actions shall be taken, as deemed appropriate by the Committee: 
  (i)    any Shares to be issued upon such exercise shall automatically be pledged against Optionee s outstanding indebtedness; and 
  (ii)    if this Option is exercised in accordance with subparagraph 9(a)(i)(B) above, the after tax proceeds of the sale of Optionee s Shares shall automatically be applied to the outstanding balance of Optionee s indebtedness. 
  10.      Responsibility for Taxes  . 
  (a)    Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Optionee s employer (the  Employer ) or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (1) withholding all applicable Tax-Related Items from Optionee s wages or other cash compensation paid to Optionee by the Company and/or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale (specifically including where this Option is exercised in accordance with subparagraph 9(a)(i)(B) above) or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise of the Option.  To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance.  Finally, Optionee must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Optionee s participation in the Plan or Optionee s purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of the Shares if Optionee fails to comply with Optionee s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Paragraph. 
  (b)    Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any or all Tax-Related Items, Optionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Optionee s responsibility and     may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Optionee s liability for Tax-Related Items     or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Optionee becomes subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  11.      Compliance with Laws and Regulations  . 
  (a)    The exercise of this Option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Company and Optionee with all applicable laws, regulations and rules relating thereto, including all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, if applicable) on which the Shares may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance and all applicable foreign laws. 
  (b)    The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares pursuant to this Option shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Shares as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. 
  12.      Successors and Assigns  .  Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and assigns and Optionee, Optionee s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Optionee s estate. 
  13.      Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to the Optionee at the address maintained for the Optionee in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party. 

14.      Construction  .  The Notice, this Agreement, and the Option evidenced hereby (a) are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan, and (b) constitute the entire agreement between Optionee and the Company on the subject matter hereof and supercede all proposals, written or oral, and all other communications between the parties related to the subject matter.  All decisions of the Committee with respect to any question or issue arising under the Notice, this Agreement or the Plan shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in this Option.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
  15.      Governing Law and Forum  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.  For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.      Excess Shares  .  If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of Shares which may without shareholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this Option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and all applicable laws, regulations and rules. 
  17.      Leave of Absence  .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to the extent permitted by local law, the following provisions shall apply upon the Optionee s commencement of an authorized leave of absence: 
  (a)    The Exercise Schedule in effect under the Notice shall be frozen as of the first day of the authorized leave, and this Option shall not become exercisable for any additional installments of the Option Shares during the period Optionee remains on such leave. 
  (b)    In no event shall this Option become exercisable for any additional Option Shares or otherwise remain outstanding if Optionee does not resume Service prior to the Expiration Date of the Option term. 
  18.      Further Instruments  .  The parties agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 
  19.      Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a) Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Optionee s personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Optionee s participation in the Plan. 
    
  (b) Optionee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about Optionee, including, but not limited to, Optionee s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all options or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee s participation in the Plan.  Optionee understands that Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in Optionee s country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Optionee s country.  Optionee understands that Optionee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Optionee s local human resources representative.  Optionee authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing Optionee s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of the Option under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Options or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited.  Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
    
  (c) Optionee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Optionee s participation in the Plan.  Optionee understands that Optionee may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting Optionee s local human resources representative in writing.  Optionee further acknowledges that withdrawal of consent may affect Optionee s ability to vest in or realize benefits from the Options, and Optionee s ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of Optionee s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Optionee understands that Optionee may contact Optionee s local human resources representative. 

20.      No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  . 
  (a)    Optionee s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with this Option or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit Optionee to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.  By accepting this Option, Optionee expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards to Optionee or benefits in lieu of Options or any other Awards even if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past.  All decisions with respect to future Option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
    
  (b)    This Option and the Shares subject to the Option are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of Optionee s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of Optionee s salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  The value of the Option and the Shares subject to the Option are an extraordinary item that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which are outside the scope of Optionee s written employment agreement (if any).   
    
  (c)      Optionee acknowledges that he or she is voluntarily participating in the Plan.  
    
  (d)      Neither the Plan nor this Option or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give Optionee a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate.  The Employer reserves the right to terminate the Service of Optionee at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles     of Incorporation     and Bylaws and a written employment agreement (if any). 
    
  (e)    The grant of the Option and Optionee's participation in the Plan     will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  
    
  (f)     The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty.  If the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value.  If Optionee exercises the Option and obtains Shares, the value of the Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price.  Optionee also understands that neither the Company, nor the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between the Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Option. 
    
  (g)     In consideration of the grant of the Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from termination of Optionee s Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and Optionee irrevocably releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, Optionee shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived Optionee s entitlement to pursue such claim. 
    
  (h)    Optionee agrees that the Company may require Options granted hereunder be exercised with, and the Option Shares held by, a broker designated by the Company.  
  (i)    Optionee agrees that his or her rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts the Optionee owes to the Company. 
  (j)    The Option and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability. 
  21.      No Advice Regarding Grant  .  The Company and the Employer have not provided any tax, legal or financial advice, nor has the Company or the Employer made any recommendations regarding Optionee s participation in the Plan, or Optionee s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares.  Optionee is hereby advised to consult with Optionee s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Optionee s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 
    
  22.      Electronic Delivery  .  The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Optionee s current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request Optionee s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.  Optionee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 
    
  23.      Language  .  If this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan is translated into a language other then English and  

the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version will take precedence. 
  24.      Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Option shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for Optionee s country of residence.  Moreover, if Optionee relocates to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to Optionee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.  The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 
  25.      Imposition of Other Requirements  .  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Optionee s participation in the Plan, on the Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan. Optionee agrees to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  Furthermore, Optionee acknowledges that the laws of the country in which Optionee is working at the time of grant, vesting and exercise of the Option or the sale of Shares received pursuant to this Agreement (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor, or other matters) may subject Optionee to additional procedural or regulatory requirements that Optionee is and will be solely responsible for and must fulfill.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT 
  Recitals 
  A. The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, non-employee members of the Board and Consultants. 
  B. Optionee is to render valuable services to the Company (or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Company s grant of an option to Optionee. 
  C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in this Agreement, the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the  Notice ), or the Plan. 
  NOW, THEREFORE  , it is hereby agreed as follows: 
  1.     Grant of Option  . The Company hereby grants to Optionee, as of the grant date, as set forth in the Notice, (the  Grant Date ) an option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Notice. The Option Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the Option term specified in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price specified in the Notice. 
  2.     Option Term  . This Option shall have a maximum term of                           years [not to exceed ten (10) years] measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 4, 5 or 6. 
  3.     Non-Transferability  . This Option shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Optionee die while holding this Option, then this Option shall be transferred in accordance with Optionee s will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
  4.     Dates of Exercise  . This Option shall vest and become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as specified in the Notice. As the Option becomes exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate and the Option shall remain exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Option term under Paragraph 5 or 6. As an administrative matter, the exercisable portion of this Option may only be exercised until the close of the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the Expiration Date or the earlier termination date under Paragraph 5 or 6 or, if such date is not a trading day on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the last trading day before such date. Any later attempt to exercise this Option will not be honored. For example, if Optionee ceases to remain in Service as provided in Paragraph 5(i) and the date three (3) months from the date of cessation is Monday, July 4 (a holiday on which the Nasdaq Global Select Market is closed), Optionee must exercise the exercisable portion of this Option by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Friday, July 1. 
  5.     Cessation of Service  . The Option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this Option shall cease to be outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions become applicable: 
  (i) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Disability or Cause and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of three (3) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (ii) If Optionee dies while this Option is outstanding, then the Optionee s designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary was designated or properly designated or, if no designated beneficiary survives the Optionee, the Optionee s estate (to the extent reasonably determinable) or other individual or entity entitled to receive the Option under applicable local law shall have the right to exercise this Option. Such right shall lapse, and this Option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (A) the expiration of the eighteen (18) month period measured from the date of Optionee s death or (B) the Expiration Date. Optionee may only make a beneficiary designation with respect to this Option if the Company has approved a process or procedure for such beneficiary designation for the local jurisdiction within which Optionee performs services for the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. If no such beneficiary designation process or procedure has been approved by the Company, then, in the event of Optionee s death, this Option may only be exercised by the Optionee s estate (to the extent reasonably determinable) or other individual or entity entitled to receive the Option under applicable local law. 
  (iii) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Disability while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of eighteen (18) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (iv) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this Option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested Option Shares for which the Option is exercisable at the date the Optionee ceases to actively provide Service (not extended by any notice period mandated under local law). Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares for which the Option has not been exercised. However, this Option shall, immediately as of the date the Optionee ceases to actively provide Service for any reason, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any Option Shares in which Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested or for which this Option is not otherwise at that time exercisable. 

(v) Should Optionee s Service be terminated for Cause or should Optionee otherwise engage in activities constituting Cause while this Option is outstanding, then this Option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding. In the event Optionee s Service is suspended pending an investigation of whether Optionee s Service will be terminated for Cause, all Optionee s rights under the Option, including the right to exercise the Option, shall be suspended during the investigation period. 
  (vi) For purposes of this Paragraph 5, in the event of Optionee s cessation of Service, Optionee s right to receive additional options or to vest in the Option will end as of the date the Optionee is no longer actively providing Service and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (  e.g  ., active Service would not include any period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when an Optionee is no longer actively providing Service for purposes of this Option. 
  6.     Special Acceleration of Option  . 
  (a) This Option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this Option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become vested and exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested Shares. No such acceleration of this Option, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) this Option is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) this Option is replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested Option Shares at the time of the Corporate Transaction (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such Shares) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the same Exercise Schedule set forth in the Notice. The determination of option comparability under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b) Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c) If this Option is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of shares and the kind of shares or securities covered by the Option and the Exercise Price immediately after such Corporate Transaction, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. 
  (d) This Option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Change in Control but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this Option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, become vested and exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested Shares. This Option shall remain so exercisable until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Option term. 
  (e) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
  7.     Adjustment in Option Shares  . In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or kind of shares or securities subject to this Option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. 
  8.     Shareholder Rights  . The holder of this Option shall not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the Option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased Shares. 
  9.     Manner of Exercising Option  . 
  (a) In order to exercise this Option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this Option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the Option) must take the following actions: 
  (i) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased Shares in one or more of the following forms: 
  (A) cash or check which, in the Company s sole discretion, shall be made payable to a Company-designated brokerage firm or the Company; and 
  (B) as permitted by applicable law, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the Option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (I) to a Company-designated brokerage firm (or in the case of an executive officer or Board member of the Company, an Optionee-designated brokerage firm) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased Shares plus, if applicable, the amount necessary to satisfy the Company s (or a Parent s, Subsidiary s or Affiliate s) withholding obligations (including income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax items  

related to Optionee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Optionee ( Tax-Related Items )) and (II) to the Company to deliver the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction. 
  (ii) Furnish to the Company appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the Option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this Option. 
  (iii) Make appropriate arrangements with the Company (or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all withholding or other obligations related to Tax-Related Items applicable to the Option grant, vesting, exercise or the sale of Shares, as applicable. 
  (b) As soon as practical after the exercise date, the Company shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this Option) the purchased Option Shares, (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), subject to the appropriate legends and/or stop transfer instructions. 
  (c) In no event may this Option be exercised for any fractional Shares. 
  (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, this Agreement or any other agreement to the contrary, if at the time this Option is exercised, Optionee is indebted to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) for any reason, the following actions shall be taken, as deemed appropriate by the Committee: 
  (i) any Shares to be issued upon such exercise shall automatically be pledged against Optionee s outstanding indebtedness; and 
  (ii) if this Option is exercised in accordance with subparagraph 9(a)(i)(B) above, the after tax proceeds of the sale of Optionee s Shares shall automatically be applied to the outstanding balance of Optionee s indebtedness. 
  10.     Responsibility for Taxes  . 
  (a) Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Optionee s employer (the  Employer ) or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding all applicable Tax-Related Items from Optionee s wages or other cash compensation paid to Optionee by the Company and/or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale (specifically including where this Option is exercised in accordance with subparagraph 9(a)(i)(B) above) or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise of the Option. To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance. Finally, Optionee must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Optionee s participation in the Plan or Optionee s purchase of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of the Shares if Optionee fails to comply with Optionee s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Paragraph. 
  (b) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any or all Tax-Related Items, Optionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Optionee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Optionee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Optionee becomes subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  11.     Compliance with Laws and Regulations  . 
  (a) The exercise of this Option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Company and Optionee with all applicable laws, regulations and rules relating thereto, including all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, if applicable) on which the Shares may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance and all applicable foreign laws. 
  (b) The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares pursuant to this Option shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Shares as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. 
  12.     Successors and Assigns  . Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and assigns and Optionee, Optionee s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Optionee s estate.  

13.     Notices  . Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to the Optionee at the address maintained for the Optionee in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party. 
  14.     Construction  . The Notice, this Agreement, and the Option evidenced hereby (a) are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan, and (b) constitute the entire agreement between Optionee and the Company on the subject matter hereof and supercede all proposals, written or oral, and all other communications between the parties related to the subject matter. All decisions of the Committee with respect to any question or issue arising under the Notice, this Agreement or the Plan shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in this Option. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
  15.     Governing Law and Forum  . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.     Excess Shares  . If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of Shares which may without shareholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this Option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and all applicable laws, regulations and rules. 
  17.     Leave of Absence  . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to the extent permitted by local law, the following provisions shall apply upon the Optionee s commencement of an authorized leave of absence: 
  (a) The Exercise Schedule in effect under the Notice shall be frozen as of the first day of the authorized leave, and this Option shall not become exercisable for any additional installments of the Option Shares during the period Optionee remains on such leave. 
  (b) In no event shall this Option become exercisable for any additional Option Shares or otherwise remain outstanding if Optionee does not resume Service prior to the Expiration Date of the Option term. 
    
  18.     Further Instruments  . The parties agree to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 
  19.     Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a) Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Optionee s personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Optionee s participation in the Plan. 
  (b) Optionee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about Optionee, including, but not limited to, Optionee s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all options or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee s participation in the Plan. Optionee understands that Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in Optionee s country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Optionee s country. Optionee understands that Optionee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Optionee s local human resources representative. Optionee authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing Optionee s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of the Option under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Options or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited. Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
  (c) Optionee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Optionee s participation in the Plan. Optionee understands that Optionee may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting Optionee s local human resources representative in writing. Optionee further acknowledges that withdrawal of consent may affect Optionee s ability to vest in or realize benefits from the Options, and Optionee s ability to participate in the Plan. For more  

information on the consequences of Optionee s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Optionee understands that Optionee may contact Optionee s local human resources representative. 
  20.     No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  . 
  (a) Optionee s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with this Option or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit Optionee to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement. By accepting this Option, Optionee expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards to Optionee or benefits in lieu of Options or any other Awards even if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past. All decisions with respect to future Option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
  (b) This Option and the Shares subject to the Option are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of Optionee s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of Optionee s salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. The value of the Option and the Shares subject to the Option are an extraordinary item that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which are outside the scope of Optionee s written employment agreement (if any). 
  (c) Optionee acknowledges that he or she is voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d) Neither the Plan nor this Option or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give Optionee a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate. The Employer reserves the right to terminate the Service of Optionee at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and a written employment agreement (if any). 
  (e) The grant of the Option and Optionee s participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  (f) The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. If the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value. If Optionee exercises the Option and obtains Shares, the value of the Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price. Optionee also understands that neither the Company, nor the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between the Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Option. 
  (g) In consideration of the grant of the Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from termination of Optionee s Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and Optionee irrevocably releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, Optionee shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived Optionee s entitlement to pursue such claim. 
  (h) Optionee agrees that the Company may require Options granted hereunder be exercised with, and the Option Shares held by, a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i) Optionee agrees that his or her rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts the Optionee owes to the Company. 
  (j) The Option and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability. 
  21.     No Advice Regarding Grant  . The Company and the Employer have not provided any tax, legal or financial advice, nor has the Company or the Employer made any recommendations regarding Optionee s participation in the Plan, or Optionee s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. Optionee is hereby advised to consult with Optionee s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Optionee s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 
  22.     Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Optionee s current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request Optionee s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Optionee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 
  23.     Language  . If this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan is translated into a language other then English and the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version will take precedence. 

24.     Appendix  . Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Option shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for Optionee s country of residence. Moreover, if Optionee relocates to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to Optionee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 
  25.     Imposition of Other Requirements  . The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Optionee s participation in the Plan, on the Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan. Optionee agrees to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. Furthermore, Optionee acknowledges that the laws of the country in which Optionee is working at the time of grant, vesting and exercise of the Option or the sale of Shares received pursuant to this Agreement (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor, or other matters) may subject Optionee to additional procedural or regulatory requirements that Optionee is and will be solely responsible for and must fulfill.

  No Employment or Service Contract  . Nothing in this Notice or in the attached Stock Option Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon Optionee any right to continue in Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) or of Optionee, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Optionee s Service at any time for any reason, with or without cause. 
  Definitions  . All capitalized terms in this Notice shall have the meaning assigned to them in this Notice, the attached Stock Option Agreement or the Plan. 

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

  A. The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, non-employee members of the Board or of the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary and Consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 
  B. Optionee is to render valuable services to the Company (or a Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Company s grant of an option to Optionee. 
  C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in this Agreement, the attached Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the   Notice ), or the Plan. 
  NOW, THEREFORE  , it is hereby agreed as follows: 
  1.     Grant of Option  . The Company hereby grants to Optionee, as of the Grant Date, an option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Notice. The Option Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the Option term specified in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price specified in the Notice. 
  2.     Option Term  . This Option shall have a maximum term of nine (9) years measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 4, 5 or 6. 
  3.     Non-Transferability  . This Option shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law.

  4.     Dates of Exercise  . This Option shall vest and become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as specified in the Notice. As the Option becomes exercisable for such installments, those installments shall accumulate and the Option shall remain exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Option term under Paragraph 5 or 6.

  (i) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Disability or Cause) while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of three (3) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (ii) If Optionee dies while this Option is outstanding, then the personal representative of Optionee s estate or the person or persons to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to Optionee s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution shall have the right to exercise this Option. Such right shall lapse, and this Option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (A) the expiration of the eighteen (18)- month period measured from the date of Optionee s death or (B) the Expiration Date. 
  (iii) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Disability while this Option is outstanding, then Optionee shall have a period of eighteen (18) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this Option, but in no event shall this Option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. 
  (iv) Optionee s date of cessation of Service shall mean the date upon which Optionee ceases active performance of services for the Company following the provision of such notification of termination or resignation from Service and shall be determined solely by this Agreement and without reference to any other agreement, written or oral, including Optionee s contract of employment, and shall not otherwise include any period of notice of termination of employment, whether expressed or implied. 
  (v) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this Option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested Option Shares for which the Option is exercisable at the time of Optionee s cessation of Service. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares for which the Option has not been exercised. However, this Option shall, immediately upon Optionee s cessation of Service for any reason, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any Option Shares in which Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested or for which this Option is not otherwise at that time exercisable. 

(vi) Should Optionee s Service be terminated for Cause or should Optionee otherwise engage in activities constituting Cause while this Option is outstanding, then this Option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding. In the event Optionee s Service with the Company is suspended pending an investigation of whether Optionee s Service will be terminated for Cause, all Optionee s rights under the Option, including the right to exercise the Option, shall be suspended during the investigation period. 
    
  6.     Special Acceleration of Option 
  (a) This Option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this Option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become vested and exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested Shares. No such acceleration of this Option, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) this Option is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) this Option is replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing on the unvested Option Shares at the time of the Corporate Transaction (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such Shares) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the same Exercise Schedule set forth in the Notice. The determination of option comparability under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b) Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c) If this Option is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of shares and the kind of shares or securities covered by the Option and the Exercise Price immediately after such Corporate Transaction, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. 
  (d) This Option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Change in Control but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this Option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, become vested and exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully-vested Shares. This Option shall remain so exercisable until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Option term. 
  (e) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
    
  7.     Adjustment in Option Shares  . In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or kind of shares or securities subject to this Option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. 
  8.     Shareholder Rights  . The holder of this Option shall not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the Option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased Shares.

  (i) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased Shares in one or more of the following forms: 
  (A) cash or check which, in the Company s sole discretion, shall be made payable to a Company-designated brokerage firm or the Company; 
  (B) as permitted by applicable law, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the Option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (I) to a Company-designated brokerage firm (or in the case of an executive officer or Board member of the Company, an Optionee-designated brokerage firm) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased Shares plus, if applicable, the amount necessary to satisfy the Company s withholding obligations at the minimum statutory withholding rates and (II) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction; and 
  (C) a promissory note payable to the Company, but only to the extent authorized by the Committee in accordance with Paragraph 13. 

(ii) Furnish to the Company appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the Option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this Option. 
  (iii) Make appropriate arrangements with the Company (or Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all tax withholding requirements applicable to the Option exercise. 
    
  (b) As soon as practical after the exercise date, the Company shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this Option) the purchased Option Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), subject to the appropriate legends and/or stop transfer instructions. 
  (c) In no event may this Option be exercised for any fractional Shares. 
  (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, this Agreement or any other agreement to the contrary, if at the time this Option is exercised, Optionee is indebted to the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary) for any reason, the following actions shall be taken, as deemed appropriate by the Committee: 
  (i) any Shares to be issued upon such exercise shall automatically be pledged against Optionee s outstanding indebtedness; and 
  (ii) if this Option is exercised in accordance with subparagraph 9(a)(i)(B) above, the after tax proceeds of the sale of Optionee s Shares shall automatically be applied to the outstanding balance of Optionee s indebtedness. 
  10.     Compliance with Laws and Regulations  . 
  (a) The exercise of this Option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Company and Optionee with all applicable laws, regulations and rules relating thereto, including all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, if applicable) on which the Shares may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance. 
  (b) The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares pursuant to this Option shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Shares as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals. 
  11.     Successors and Assigns  .

  14.     Construction  . The Notice, this Agreement, and the Option evidenced hereby (a) are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan, and (b) constitute the entire agreement between Optionee and the Company on the subject matter hereof and supercede all proposals, written or oral, and all other communications between the parties related to the subject matter. All decisions of the Committee with respect to any question or issue arising under the Notice, this Agreement or the Plan shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in this Option. 
  15.     Governing Law  . The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to the conflict of laws principles thereof. 
  16.     Excess Shares  . If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of Shares which may without shareholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this Option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and all applicable laws, regulations and rules.

  6.      Taxes  . 
    
  (a)  Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Performance-Based Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.

Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.

If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.  To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance. 
    
  (c)  Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied.

If you take a leave of absence, the Company may, at its discretion and to the extent permitted under applicable local law, either suspend vesting during the period of leave or pro-rate the Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding the Company s Vesting Policy for Leaves of Absence.   
  3.      Termination of Service  . 
  (a)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 3(b) below or Section 4, in the event of the termination of your Service for any reason (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), all unvested Performance-Based Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited without consideration.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, your right to vest in the Performance-Based Stock Units will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing Service (or earlier upon your  Separation from Service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A) and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (  e.g.  , active Service would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the Performance-Based Stock Units.

   1    If you are subject to the employment protections of a country within the European Economic Area because you reside in such country or are otherwise subject thereto,  Retirement  shall mean your years of Service is at least equal to _______ (_____), regardless of your age, and the provisions concerning Retirement shall apply to you so long as the termination of your Service occurs no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the Grant Date.  In all cases, years of Service shall be determined based on the date you originally provided Service.  If you previously terminated Service, but subsequently returned to Service prior to the Grant Date, you will receive credit for your prior Service. 

(i)    Unless prohibited by applicable law, you shall render, as an independent advisor or consultant and not as an Employee, such advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) as shall reasonably be requested by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), and such services shall not be terminated for Cause (for purposes of clarity, any request to provide such advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) shall not be considered a continuation of  Service  unless the Company specifically provides that the continuation of services is a continuation of  Service  for purposes of this Section 3(b)). 
  (ii)    For a period of ___ (__) beginning on the date of your termination of Service or during any period in which you provide independent advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), you shall not directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of other persons or entities, intentionally solicit or induce (a) any employee of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) to leave the employee s employment in order to accept employment with another person or entity or (b) any customer of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) with whom you have worked in your capacity as an Employee prior to your termination of Service whose identity and/or any related information constitutes protected trade secrets (with such customers determined as of the date of the termination of your Service, to retain or use any other person or entity for the purpose of rendering services in competition with the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) or to purchase products from any business which, in the opinion of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), competes with or is in conflict with the interests of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), in either case, unless these restrictions are prohibited (whether in whole or in part) by applicable law. 
  (iii)    For a period of ___ (__) beginning on the date of your termination of Service or during any period in which you provide independent advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), you shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the opinion of the Company, competes with or is in conflict with the interests of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), unless this restriction is prohibited by applicable law. 
  (iv)    You shall not, without prior written authorization from the Company, use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets concerning the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), in each case as determined by the Committee, and the Committee s determination shall be conclusive and binding. 
  (c)    Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of the termination of your Service for Cause or in the event of the termination for Cause of any independent advisory or consulting services you may be providing as described in Section 3(b)(i), any unsettled or unvested Performance-Based Stock Units shall terminate and be forfeited immediately without consideration. 
  4.      Special Acceleration  . 
    
  (a)    To the extent the Performance-Based Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction, such Performance-Based Stock Units shall automatically become vested in full at the Target Amount immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction and settled in accordance with Section 5 below.  No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent:  (i) these Performance-Based Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable performance-based stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof), in each case, having a minimum payout equal to the Target Amount and preserving the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below or (ii) these Performance-Based Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and, at a minimum, preserves the fair market value of the Performance-Based Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction (based on the Target Amount) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below.  The determination of the comparability of performance-based stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.   
    
  (b)    Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the settlement of Performance-Based Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
    
  (c)    If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 
    
  (d)    To the extent the Performance-Based Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, such Performance-Based Stock Units shall automatically accelerate immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and shall become vested in full at the Target Amount at that time and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. 
    
  (e)    This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

5.      Settlement of Performance-Based Stock Units  .   
    
  (a)      General Settlement Terms  .  The Performance-Based Stock Units, to the extent earned and vested hereunder (including, without limitation by reason of Retirement), shall be automatically settled in Shares on the Vest Date (which constitutes a fixed payment date for purposes of Code Section 409A) or, if earlier, upon the earliest to occur of the settlement events set forth below or in the Company s Vesting Acceleration Policy for Death and Terminal Illness; it being understood that nothing herein shall limit the Company s ability to amend or terminate such policy in its sole discretion and without your consent. 
    
  (b)      Corporate Transaction  .  If, as of the Grant Date, you have not satisfied and it is not possible for you to satisfy the age and Service Retirement conditions with respect to this Performance-Based Stock Unit award and this Performance-Based Stock Unit award is not assumed or replaced as described in Section 4(a) in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction instead of on the Vest Date. 
    
  (c)      Change in Control  .  In the event a Change in Control is consummated prior to the Vest Date and such Change in Control is a permissible distribution event under Code Section 409A, the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control.  In the event such Change in Control is not a permissible distribution event under Code Section 409A, the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon the earlier of (i) the Vest Date or (ii) your Separation from Service that occurs immediately prior to or at any time after such Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as of the Grant Date, you have not satisfied and it is not possible for you to satisfy the age and Service Retirement conditions with respect to this Performance-Based Stock Unit award, then such settlement shall in all cases occur immediately prior the effective date of the Change in Control. 
    
  (d)    The Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable tax and/or other obligations pursuant to Section 6 below and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable law. 
    
  (e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5 or in this Agreement, to the extent your Performance-Based Stock Units would otherwise be settled upon your Separation from Service, such settlement shall instead occur upon the Company s first business day following the six-month anniversary of your Separation from Service. 
    
  (f)    Prior to the time that the Performance-Based Stock Units are settled, you shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company.  The Performance-Based Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
    
  6.      Taxes  . 
    
  (a)    Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Performance-Based Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
    
  (b)    Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account of any obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Performance-Based Stock Units.  In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.  To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may  

withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance. 
    
  (c)    Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 
    
  7.      Tax and Legal Advice  .  You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, your Employer or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK UNITS.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR YOUR EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD.  NOTHING STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES.  
    
  8.      Non-Transferability of Performance-Based Stock Units  .  Performance-Based Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. 
    
  9.      Restriction on Transfer  .  Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law including all applicable foreign laws. 
    
  10.      Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  .  Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
    
  11.      Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  .  You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws. 
    
  12.      Voting and Other Rights  .  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Performance-Based Stock Units are settled in Shares.  In addition, you shall not have any rights to dividend equivalent payments with respect to Performance-Based Stock Units. 
    
  13.      Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
    
  (a)      You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
    
    (b)      You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance-Based Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  You understand that Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.  You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative.  You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Performance-Based Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Performance-Based Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may  

be deposited.  Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
    
  (c)      You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.  You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local human resources representative in writing.  You further acknowledge that withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Performance-Based Stock Units, and your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
    
  14.      No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  .   
    
  (a)    Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Performance-Based Stock Units     or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.  By accepting these Performance-Based Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Performance-Based Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Performance-Based Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past.  All decisions with respect to future grants of Performance-Based Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee.  
    
  (b)    The Performance-Based Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Performance-Based Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer     or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  The value of the Performance-Based Stock Units     is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which is outside the scope of your written employment agreement (if any).   
    
  (c)    You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
    
  (d)    Neither the Plan nor these Performance-Based Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate.  The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and a written employment agreement (if any).   
    
  (e)    The grant of the Performance-Based Stock Units and your participation in the Plan     will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
    
  (f)    The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and if you vest in the Performance-Based Stock Units and are issued Shares, the value of those Shares may increase or decrease.  You also understand that neither the Company, nor the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
    
  (g)    In consideration of the grant of the Performance-Based Stock Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance-Based Stock Units resulting from termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) or from the Company s determination that performance goals have not been satisfied in whole or in part and you irrevocably release the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim.  
    
  (h)    You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company.

To the extent any capitalized terms used in this Agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of the Plan and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Plan terms and provisions shall prevail. 
  In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.   Performance-Based Stock Units  . Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you, [subject to the approval by the stockholders of the Company of the amendment and restatement of the Plan,] and you hereby accept from the Company, Performance-Based Stock Units, each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent in value of one (1) Share, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan. The Target Amount of Performance-Based Stock Units stated above reflects the target number of Performance-Based Stock Units (the  Target Amount ). The number of Performance-Based Stock Units ultimately paid out to you will range from                  % to                  % of the Target Amount as determined based upon the Company s performance during the performance period against the performance goals as set forth in   Exhibit A  . 
  2.   Vesting of Performance-Based Stock Units  . So long as your Service continues and subject to, and to the extent of, the satisfaction of the performance goals as set forth in   Exhibit A  , the Performance-Based Stock Units shall vest in accordance with the following schedule:                                      (                   %) of the total number of Performance-Based Stock Units earned, if any, pursuant to the satisfaction of the performance goals in   Exhibit A   shall vest on the Vest Date, unless otherwise provided by the Plan or Sections 3(b) or 4 below. If you take a leave of absence, the Company may, at its discretion and to the extent permitted under applicable local law, either suspend vesting during the period of leave or pro-rate the Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding the Company s Vesting Policy for Leaves of Absence. Prior to the time that the Performance-Based Stock Units are settled, you shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. The Performance-Based Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
  3.   Termination of Service  . 
  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3(b) below or Section 4, in the event of the termination of your Service for any reason (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), all unvested Performance-Based Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited without consideration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, your right to vest in the Performance-Based Stock Units will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing Service (or earlier upon your  Separation from Service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A) and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (  e.g.  , active Service would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the Performance-Based Stock Units. 
  (b) In the event that you resign or your Service is terminated for any reason other than Cause on or after the date that (x) you have attained at least                              (                  ) years of age and (y) your age plus your years of Service is at least equal to                              (                  ), and so long as such resignation or the termination of your Service occurs no earlier than the                      anniversary of the Grant Date (the satisfaction of the aforementioned conditions is referred to herein as  Retirement     1    ), all unvested Performance-Based Stock Units may be earned pursuant to the satisfaction of the performance goals in   Exhibit A  , and shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set  
    
   1    If you are subject to the employment protections of a country within the European Economic Area because you reside in such country or are otherwise subject thereto,  Retirement  shall mean your years of Service is at least equal to _______ (_____), regardless of your age, and the provisions concerning Retirement shall apply to you so long as the termination of your Service occurs no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the Grant Date.  In all cases, years of Service shall be determined based on the date you originally provided Service.  If you previously terminated Service, but subsequently returned to Service prior to the Grant Date, you will receive credit for your prior Service. 

forth in Section 2 above, determined as if your Service had continued after your resignation or termination of Service, and shall be settled in accordance with Section 5(a); provided that any unsettled or unvested Performance-Based Stock Units shall be forfeited without consideration immediately upon the breach of any of the following conditions: 
  (i) Unless prohibited by applicable law, you shall render, as an independent advisor or consultant and not as an Employee, such advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) as shall reasonably be requested by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), and such services shall not be terminated for Cause (for purposes of clarity, any request to provide such advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) shall not be considered a continuation of  Service  unless the Company specifically provides that the continuation of services is a continuation of  Service  for purposes of this Section 3(b)). 
  (ii) For a period of                  (              ) beginning on the date of your termination of Service or during any period in which you provide independent advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), you shall not directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of other persons or entities, intentionally solicit or induce (a) any employee of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) to leave the employee s employment in order to accept employment with another person or entity or (b) any customer of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) with whom you have worked in your capacity as an Employee prior to your termination of Service whose identity and/or any related information constitutes protected trade secrets (with such customers determined as of the date of the termination of your Service, to retain or use any other person or entity for the purpose of rendering services in competition with the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) or to purchase products from any business which, in the opinion of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), competes with or is in conflict with the interests of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), in either case, unless these restrictions are prohibited (whether in whole or in part) by applicable law. 
  (iii) For a period of                  (              ) beginning on the date of your termination of Service or during any period in which you provide independent advisory or consulting services to the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), you shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the opinion of the Company, competes with or is in conflict with the interests of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), unless this restriction is prohibited by applicable law. 
  (iv) You shall not, without prior written authorization from the Company, use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets concerning the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate), in each case as determined by the Committee, and the Committee s determination shall be conclusive and binding. 
  (c) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of the termination of your Service for Cause or in the event of the termination for Cause of any independent advisory or consulting services you may be providing as described in Section 3(b)(i), any unsettled or unvested Performance-Based Stock Units shall terminate and be forfeited immediately without consideration. 
  4.   Special Acceleration  . 
  (a) To the extent the Performance-Based Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction, such Performance-Based Stock Units shall automatically become vested in full at the Target Amount immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) these Performance-Based Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable performance-based stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof), in each case, having a minimum payout equal to the Target Amount and preserving the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below or (ii) these Performance-Based Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and, at a minimum, preserves the fair market value of the Performance-Based Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction (based on the Target Amount) and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below. The determination of the comparability of performance-based stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b) Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the settlement of Performance-Based Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c) If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 
  (d) To the extent the Performance-Based Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, such Performance-Based Stock Units shall automatically accelerate immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and shall become vested in full at the Target Amount at that time and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. 
  (e) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

5.   Settlement of Performance-Based Stock Units  . 
  (a)   General Settlement Terms  . The Performance-Based Stock Units, to the extent earned and vested hereunder (including, without limitation by reason of Retirement), shall be automatically settled in Shares on the Vest Date (which constitutes a fixed payment date for purposes of Code Section 409A) or, if earlier, upon the earliest to occur of the settlement events set forth below or in the Company s Vesting Acceleration Policy for Death and Terminal Illness; it being understood that nothing herein shall limit the Company s ability to amend or terminate such policy in its sole discretion and without your consent. 
  (b)   Corporate Transaction  . If, as of the Grant Date, you have not satisfied and it is not possible for you to satisfy the age and Service Retirement conditions with respect to this Performance-Based Stock Unit award and this Performance-Based Stock Unit award is not assumed or replaced as described in Section 4(a) in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction instead of on the Vest Date. 
  (c)   Change in Control  . In the event a Change in Control is consummated prior to the Vest Date and such Change in Control is a permissible distribution event under Code Section 409A, the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control. In the event such Change in Control is not a permissible distribution event under Code Section 409A, the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon the earlier of (i) the Vest Date or (ii) your Separation from Service that occurs immediately prior to or at any time after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as of the Grant Date, you have not satisfied and it is not possible for you to satisfy the age and Service Retirement conditions with respect to this Performance-Based Stock Unit award, then such settlement shall in all cases occur immediately prior the effective date of the Change in Control. 
  (d) The Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable tax and/or other obligations pursuant to Section 6 below and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable law. 
  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5 or in this Agreement, to the extent your Performance-Based Stock Units would otherwise be settled upon your Separation from Service, such settlement shall instead occur upon the Company s first business day following the six-month anniversary of your Separation from Service. 
  6.   Taxes  . 
  (a) Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Performance-Based Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  (b) Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Performance-Based Stock Units. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding of Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance. 
  (c) Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 

7.   Tax and Legal Advice  . You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, your Employer s or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK UNITS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR YOUR EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD. NOTHING STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES. 
  8.   Non-Transferability of Performance-Based Stock Units  . Performance-Based Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. 
  9.   Restriction on Transfer  . Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law including all applicable foreign laws. 
  10.   Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  . Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
  11.   Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  . You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws. 
  12.   Voting and Other Rights  . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Performance-Based Stock Units are settled in Shares. In addition, you shall not have any rights to dividend equivalent payments with respect to Performance-Based Stock Units. 
  13.   Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a)   You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
  (b)   You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance-Based Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Performance-Based Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Performance-Based Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited. Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
  (c)   You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local human resources representative in writing. You further acknowledge that withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Performance-Based Stock Units, and your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
  14.   No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  . 

(a) Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Performance-Based Stock Units or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement. By accepting these Performance-Based Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Performance-Based Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Performance-Based Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past. All decisions with respect to future grants of Performance-Based Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
  (b) The Performance-Based Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Performance-Based Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. The value of the Performance-Based Stock Units is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which is outside the scope of your written employment agreement (if any). 
  (c) You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d) Neither the Plan nor these Performance-Based Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate. The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and a written employment agreement (if any). 
  (e) The grant of the Performance-Based Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  (f) The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and if you vest in the Performance-Based Stock Units and are issued Shares, the value of those Shares may increase or decrease. You also understand that neither the     
  Company, nor the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
  (g) In consideration of the grant of the Performance-Based Stock Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance-Based Stock Units resulting from termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) or from the Company s determination that performance goals have not been satisfied in whole or in part and you irrevocably release the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. 
  (h) You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i) You agree that your rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts you owe the Company. 
  (j) The Performance-Based Stock Units and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability. 
  15.   Governing Law and Forum  . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.   Notices  . Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to you at the address maintained for you in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party. 
  17.   Binding Effect  . Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the executors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto. 

18.   Severability  . If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible. In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent possible. 
    
  19.   Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 
  20.   Language  . If this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan is translated into a language other than English and the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version will take precedence. 
  21.   Appendix  . Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Performance-Based Stock Units shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for your country of residence. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 
  22.   Imposition of Other Requirements  .

  CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
  This Stock Unit Agreement (the  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of the Grant Date (as defined below) by and between Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation (the  Company ), and you pursuant to the Cisco Systems, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).  The material terms of this Stock Unit Award are as follows: 
  Employee ID:              __________________________________     
  Grant Date:        __________________________________ 
  Grant Number:        __________________________________ 
  Restricted Stock Units:    __________________________________     
  First Vest Date:        __________________________________ 
  To the extent any capitalized terms used in this Agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan.  In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of the Plan and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Plan terms and provisions shall prevail. 
  In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.  Restricted Stock Units  .  Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you, and you hereby accept from the Company, Restricted Stock Units, each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent in value of one (1) Share, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan. 
  2.  Vesting of Restricted Stock Units  .  So long as your Service continues, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest in accordance with the following schedule:  _______ (___%) of the total number of Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall vest on the First Vest Date and on each anniversary thereafter, unless otherwise provided by the Plan or Section 4 below.  If you take a leave of absence, the Company may, at its discretion, suspend vesting during the period of leave to the extent permitted under the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing Service or under the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any. 
  3.  Termination of Service  .  In the event of the termination of your Service for any reason (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or providing Service, or the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited without consideration.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, your right to vest in the Restricted Stock Units will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer providing Service, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer providing Service for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units. 
  4.  Special Acceleration  . 
  (a)  To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically become vested in full immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction.  No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent:  (i) these Restricted Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable restricted stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) these Restricted Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and preserves the fair market value of the Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below.  The determination of the comparability of restricted stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b)  Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the deferred settlement of Restricted Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c)  If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 
  (d)  This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

5.  Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  .  To the extent you are eligible but have not elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Units, provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable Tax-Related Items, as described and defined in Section 6 below, and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable laws.  To the extent you are eligible but have elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the vested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in Shares upon the earlier of: (a) your separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A ( Separation from Service ) and (b) the fixed payment date elected by you, if any, at the time of such deferral (which shall be the first business day of a year no earlier than six years after the year of the Grant Date in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee), provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless such issuance complies with all applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent your Restricted Stock Units would otherwise be settled upon your Separation from Service, such settlement shall instead occur upon the Company's first business day following the six-month anniversary of your Separation from Service.  Prior to the time that the Restricted Stock Units are settled, you shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company.  The Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
  6.  Taxes  . 
  (a)  Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Restricted Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  (b)  Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account of any obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Restricted Stock Units.  In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.  You agree to provide the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator with the information necessary to manage your Tax-Related Item withholding and acknowledge that should you fail to provide such information on a timely basis, the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator may be obligated to withhold amounts from you and it may be necessary for you to seek a refund directly from the tax authorities.  To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance.  If the Company does not satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by the withholding of Shares and instead withholds proceeds from the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash to the extent that any over-withheld amount has not otherwise been remitted to the applicable tax authority and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. 
  (c)  Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 
  7.  Tax and Legal Advice  .  You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, the Employer s or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND THE EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR THE EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD.  NOTHING  

STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES.  
  8.  Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock Units  .  Restricted Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. 
  9.  Restriction on Transfer  .  Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law, including all applicable foreign laws. 
  10.  Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  .  Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
  11.  Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  .  You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws. 
  12.  Voting, Dividend and Other Rights  .  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and except as set forth below, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a shareholder of the Company unless and until the Restricted Stock Units are settled in Shares.  To the extent you have elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units with a First Vest Date on or after September 11, 2016, dividend equivalents shall only accrue after the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and will be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they attach as set forth in the Plan or this Agreement and will be settled in additional Shares upon the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units as set forth in Section 5 above. 
  13.  Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a)  You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
  (b)  You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  You understand that the Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.  You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative.  You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Restricted Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited.  Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
  (c)  You understand that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.  You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local human resources representative in writing.  Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards, or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Restricted Stock Units and your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
  14.  No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  .   
  (a)  Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Restricted Stock Units     or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.  By accepting these Restricted Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Restricted Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted  

Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past.  All decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee.  
  (b)  The Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  The value of the Restricted Stock Units     is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which is outside the scope of your written employment or service agreement (if any).   
  (c)  You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d)  Neither the Plan nor these Restricted Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate.  The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason. 
  (e)  The grant of the Restricted Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or service relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  (f)  The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty and if you vest in the Restricted Stock Units and are issued Shares, the value of those Shares may increase or decrease.  You also understand that none of the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between the Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
  (g)  No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from the termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or providing Service, or the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any) and, in consideration of the grant of the Award to which you are not otherwise entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Employer, the Company or its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by accepting the Award, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed to not pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request the withdrawal of such claim.  
  (h)  You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i)  You agree that your rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts you owe the Company. 
  (j)  Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for in connection with any Corporate Transaction affecting the Common Stock. 
  15.  Governing Law and Forum  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.  For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.  Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to you at the address maintained for you in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party. 
  17.  Binding Effect  .  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the executors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto. 
  18.  Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible.  In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent possible. 
  19.  Waiver  .  You agree that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other participant. 
  20.  Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.  You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 

21.  Language  .  If this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan is translated into a language other than English and the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version will take precedence. 
  22.  Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for your country of residence.  Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.  The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 
  23.  Imposition of Other Requirements  .      The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Restricted Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.  You agree to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  Furthermore, you acknowledge that the laws of the country in which you are working at the time of grant, vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the sale of Shares received pursuant to this Agreement (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor, or other matters) may subject you to additional procedural or regulatory requirements that you are and will be solely responsible for and must fulfill. 
  24.  Acceptance of Agreement  .  You must expressly accept the terms and conditions of your Restricted Stock Units as set forth in this Agreement by electronically accepting this Agreement within 300 days after the Company sends this Agreement to you.

In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.  You agree to provide the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator with the information necessary to manage your Tax-Related Item withholding and acknowledge that should you fail to provide such information on a timely basis, the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator may be obligated to withhold amounts from you and it may be necessary for you to seek a refund directly from the tax authorities.  To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance.  If the Company does not satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by the withholding of Shares and instead withholds proceeds from the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash to the extent that any over-withheld amount has not otherwise been remitted to the applicable tax authority and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. 
  (c)    Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 

7.      Tax and Legal Advice  .  You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, the Employer s or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND THE EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR THE EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD.

  9.      Restriction on Transfer  .  Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law, including all applicable foreign laws. 
  10.      Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  .  Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
  11.      Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  .  You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws. 
  12.      Voting, Dividend and Other Rights  .  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and except as set forth below, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a shareholder of the Company unless and until the Restricted Stock Units are settled in Shares.  To the extent you have elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units with a First Vest Date on or after September 11, 2016, dividend equivalents shall only accrue after the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and will be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they attach as set forth in the Plan or this Agreement and will be settled in additional Shares upon the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units as set forth in Section 5 above. 
  13.      Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a)      You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
  (b)      You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  You understand that the Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.  You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative.  You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Restricted Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited.  Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
  (c)      You understand that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.  You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local  

human resources representative in writing.  Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards, or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Restricted Stock Units and your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
  14.      No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  .   
  (a)    Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Restricted Stock Units     or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.  By accepting these Restricted Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Restricted Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past.  All decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee.  
  (b)    The Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer     or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.  The value of the Restricted Stock Units     is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which is outside the scope of your written employment or service agreement (if any).   
  (c)    You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d)    Neither the Plan nor these Restricted Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate.  The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason. 
  (e)    The grant of the Restricted Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or service relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  (f)    The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty and if you vest in the Restricted Stock Units and are issued Shares, the value of those Shares may increase or decrease.  You also understand that none of the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between the Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
  (g)    No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from the termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or providing Service, or the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any) and, in consideration of the grant of the Award to which you are not otherwise entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Employer, the Company or its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by accepting the Award, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed to not pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request the withdrawal of such claim.  
  (h)    You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i)    You agree that your rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts you owe the Company. 
  (j)    Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for in connection with any Corporate Transaction affecting the Common Stock. 

15.      Governing Law and Forum  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.  For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.      Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to you at the address maintained for you in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party. 
  17.      Binding Effect  .  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the executors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto. 
  18.      Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible.  In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent possible. 
  19.      Waiver  .  You agree that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other participant. 
  20.      Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.  You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 
  21.      Language  .  If this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan is translated into a language other than English and the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version will take precedence. 
  22.      Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Appendix to this Agreement for your country of residence.  Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.  The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 
  23.      Imposition of Other Requirements  .      The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Restricted Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.  You agree to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  Furthermore, you acknowledge that the laws of the country in which you are working at the time of grant, vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the sale of Shares received pursuant to this Agreement (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor, or other matters) may subject you to additional procedural or regulatory requirements that you are and will be solely responsible for and must fulfill. 
  24.      Acceptance of Agreement  .  You must expressly accept the terms and conditions of your Restricted Stock Units as set forth in this Agreement by electronically accepting this Agreement within 300 days after the Company sends this Agreement to you.

Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you, and you hereby accept from the Company, Restricted Stock Units, each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent in value of one (1) Share, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan.

If you take a leave of absence, the Company may, at its discretion, suspend vesting during the period of leave to the extent permitted under the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing Service or the terms your employment or service agreement, if any.  Prior to the time that the Restricted Stock Units are settled, you shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company.  The Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
  3.  Termination of Service  .  In the event of the termination of your Service for any reason (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or providing Service, or the terms your employment or service agreement, if any), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited without consideration.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, your right to vest in the Restricted Stock Units will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer providing Service; the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer providing Service for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units. 
  4.  Special Acceleration  . 
  (a)  To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically become vested in full immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction.  No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent:  (i) these Restricted Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable restricted stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) these Restricted Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and preserves the fair market value of the Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below.  The determination of the comparability of restricted stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b)  Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the deferred settlement of Restricted Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 

(c)  If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 
  (d)  To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically accelerate immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and shall become vested in full at that time and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. 
  (e)  This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
  5.  Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  .  To the extent you are eligible but have not elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Units, provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable Tax-Related Items, as described an defined in Section 6 below, and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable laws.

To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance.  If the Company does not satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by the withholding of Shares and instead withholds proceeds from the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash to the extent that any over-withheld amount has not otherwise been remitted to the applicable tax authority and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. 
  (c)  Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be  

satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied.

  (a)  Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Restricted Stock Units     or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.  By accepting these Restricted Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Restricted Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past.  All decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee.  
  (b)  The Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer     or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.

  (c)  You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d)  Neither the Plan nor these Restricted Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate.  The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason. 
  (e)  The grant of the Restricted Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or service relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.

You also understand that none of the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between the Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
  (g)  No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from the termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or providing Service, or the terms your employment or service agreement, if any) and, in consideration of the grant of the Award to which you are not otherwise entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Employer, the Company or its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by accepting the Award, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed to not pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request the withdrawal of such claim.  
  (h)  You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i)  You agree that your rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts you owe the Company. 
  (j)  Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for in connection with any Corporate Transaction affecting the Common Stock. 
  15.  Governing Law and Forum  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  18.  Severability  .

In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent possible. 
  19.  Waiver  .  You agree that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other participant.

  STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
  This Stock Unit Agreement (the  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of the Grant Date (as defined below) by and between Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation (the  Company ), and you pursuant to the Cisco Systems, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). The material terms of this Stock Unit Award are as follows:

To the extent any capitalized terms used in this Agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of the Plan and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Plan terms and provisions shall prevail. 
  In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.   Restricted Stock Units  . Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you, and you hereby accept from the Company, Restricted Stock Units, each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent in value of one (1) Share, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan. 
  2.   Vesting of Restricted Stock Units  . So long as your Service continues, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest in accordance with the following schedule: ___________ percent (__%) of the total number of Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall vest on the First Vest Date and on each __________ anniversary thereafter, unless otherwise provided by the Plan or Section 4 below. If you take a leave of absence, the Company may, at its discretion, suspend vesting during the period of leave to the extent permitted under applicable local law. Prior to the time that the Restricted Stock Units are settled, you shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. The Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
  3.   Termination of Service  . In the event of the termination of your Service for any reason (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited without consideration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, your right to vest in the Restricted Stock Units will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing Service and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (  e.g.  , active Service would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units.  
  4.   Special Acceleration  . 
  (a) To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Corporate Transaction, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically become vested in full immediately prior to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction. No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) these Restricted Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable restricted stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) these Restricted Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and preserves the fair market value of the Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below. The determination of the comparability of restricted stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b) Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the deferred settlement of Restricted Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c) If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 

(d) To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically accelerate immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and shall become vested in full at that time and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. 
  (e) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
  5.   Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  . To the extent you are eligible but have not elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Units, provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable tax and/or other obligations pursuant to Section 6 below and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable law. To the extent you are eligible but have elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the vested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in Shares upon the earlier of: (a) your separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A ( Separation from Service ) and (b) the fixed payment date elected by you, if any, at the time of such deferral (which shall be the first business day of a year no earlier than six years after the year of the Grant Date in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee), provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless such issuance complies with all applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent your Restricted Stock Units would otherwise be settled upon your Separation from Service, such settlement shall instead occur upon the Company s first business day following the six-month anniversary of your Separation from Service. 
  6.   Taxes  . 
  (a) Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Restricted Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  (b) Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Restricted Stock Units. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding of Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance. 
  (c) Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 
    
  7.   Tax and Legal Advice  . You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, your Employer s or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR YOUR EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD. NOTHING STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES. 

8.   Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock Units  . Restricted Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. 
  9.   Restriction on Transfer  . Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law including all applicable foreign laws. 
  10.   Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  . Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
  11.   Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  . You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws. 
  12.   Voting and Other Rights  . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Restricted Stock Units are settled in Shares. In addition, you shall not have any rights to dividend equivalent payments with respect to Restricted Stock Units. 
    
  13.   Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a)   You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan  . 
  (b)   You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Restricted Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited. Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan  . 
  (c)   You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local human resources representative in writing. You further acknowledge that withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Restricted Stock Units, and your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative  . 
    
  14.   No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  .

The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.

All decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 

(b) The Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.

No such accelerated vesting, however, shall occur if and to the extent: (i) these Restricted Stock Units are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or replaced with comparable restricted stock units of the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or (ii) these Restricted Stock Units are replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which complies with Code Section 409A and preserves the fair market value of the Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Corporate Transaction and provides for subsequent pay-out in accordance with the settlement provisions set forth in Section 5 below. The determination of the comparability of restricted stock units under clause (i) shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
  (b) Immediately following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, this Agreement shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except as set forth in Section 5 below with respect to the deferred settlement of Restricted Stock Units or to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 
  (c) If this Agreement is assumed in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee shall appropriately adjust the number of units and the kind of shares or securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement immediately after such Corporate Transaction. 

(d) To the extent the Restricted Stock Units are outstanding at the time of a Change in Control, such Restricted Stock Units shall automatically accelerate immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and shall become vested in full at that time and settled in accordance with Section 5 below. 
  (e) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
  5.   Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  . To the extent you are eligible but have not elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically settled in Shares upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Units, provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until you have satisfied any applicable tax and/or other obligations pursuant to Section 6 below and such issuance otherwise complies with all applicable law. To the extent you are eligible but have elected to defer settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the vested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in Shares upon the earlier of: (a) your separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A ( Separation from Service ) and (b) the fixed payment date elected by you, if any, at the time of such deferral (which shall be the first business day of a year no earlier than five years after the year of the Grant Date in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee), provided that the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless such issuance complies with all applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent your Restricted Stock Units would otherwise be settled upon your Separation from Service, such settlement shall instead occur upon the Company s first business day following the six-month anniversary of your Separation from Service. 
  6.   Taxes  . 
  (a) Regardless of any action the Company or your employer (the  Employer ) takes with respect to any and all income tax, social taxes or insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items with respect to the Restricted Stock Units is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  (b) Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Restricted Stock Units. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding of Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. To avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory rates or may take any other action required to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable accounting guidance.  
  (c) Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied. 
  7.   Tax and Legal Advice  . You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, your Employer s or the Company s or the Employer s representatives for an assessment of such consequences. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR YOUR EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD. NOTHING STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES. 

8.   Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock Units  . Restricted Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law. 
  9.   Restriction on Transfer  . Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law including all applicable foreign laws. 
  10.   Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions  . Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company s transfer agent as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
  11.   Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  . You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws.     
  12.   Voting and Other Rights  . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Restricted Stock Units are settled in Shares. In addition, you shall not have any rights to dividend equivalent payments with respect to Restricted Stock Units. 
  13.   Authorization to Release and Transfer Necessary Personal Information  . 
  (a)   You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal information as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Employer, and the Company and its Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. 
  (b)   You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number (or any other social or national identification number), salary, nationality, job title, residency status, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding (the  Data ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, including outside the European Economic Area, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data to a broker or other third party assisting with the administration of these Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or with whom Shares acquired pursuant to these Restricted Stock Units or cash from the sale of such Shares may be deposited. Furthermore, you acknowledge and understand that the transfer of the Data to the Company or any of its Parent, Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any third parties is necessary for your participation in the Plan. 
  (c)   You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein by contacting your local human resources representative in writing. You further acknowledge that withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to vest in or realize benefits from these Restricted Stock Units, and your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
  14.   No Entitlement or Claims for Compensation  .    
  (a) Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with these Restricted Stock Units or any other Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement. By accepting these Restricted Stock Units, you expressly acknowledge that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Restricted Stock Units to you or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past. All decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
  (b) The Restricted Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation and are not to be considered compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of your normal or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of your salary, compensation or other remuneration for any purpose, including but not limited to,  

calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. The value of the Restricted Stock Units is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and which is outside the scope of your written employment agreement (if any). 
  (c) You acknowledge that you are voluntarily participating in the Plan. 
  (d) Neither the Plan nor these Restricted Stock Units or any other Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give you a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate. The Employer reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time, with or without cause, and for any reason, subject to applicable laws, the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and a written employment agreement (if any). 
  (e) The grant of the Restricted Stock Units and your participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  (f) The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and if you vest in the Restricted Stock Units and are issued Shares, the value of those Shares may increase or decrease. You also understand that neither the Company, nor the Employer or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your Employer s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of this Award. 
  (g) In consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from termination of your Service by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you irrevocably release the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. 
  (h) You agree that the Company may require Shares received pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units to be held by a broker designated by the Company. 
  (i) You agree that your rights hereunder (if any) shall be subject to set-off by the Company for any valid debts you owe the Company. 
  (j) The Restricted Stock Units and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of liability. 
  15.   Governing Law and Forum  . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to litigation in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California and no other courts. 
  16.   Notices  . Any notice required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or sent by confirmed email, telegram, or fax or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the mail, as certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, and addressed to the Company at the Company s principal corporate offices or to you at the address maintained for you in the Company s records or, in either case, as subsequently modified by written notice to the other party.

  18.   Severability  . If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible. In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the full extent possible. 
  19.   Electronic Delivery  . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application

Furthermore, you acknowledge that the laws of the country in which you are working at the time of grant, vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the sale of Shares received pursuant to this Agreement (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor, or other matters) may subject you to additional procedural or regulatory requirements that you are and will be solely responsible for and must fulfill. 
  23.   Acceptance of Agreement  .

  [Name] 
  [Address] 
  [Address] 
  Dear                              : 
  [introductory text] 
  Your leadership team has recommended that you receive a performance-based restricted stock unit (PRSU) right with a target of [                          ]. RSUs will be granted after the end of FY[          ] based upon the satisfaction of an FY[          ] performance condition. 
  The right to receive a grant of a restricted stock unit depends on Cisco s satisfaction of certain [                          ] targets for FY[          ]. Assuming those targets are met or exceeded, the restricted stock units that you are granted will vest [                          ] percent on the date of grant and [                          ] percent on each of the next [                  ] anniversaries of the date of grant thereafter, subject to your continued employment with Cisco or an affiliate on the applicable vesting date. On each vesting date, the vested units will be settled in Cisco common stock. In addition, in the unlikely event that a corporate transaction or change in control (each as defined in Cisco s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan) is consummated during FY[          ] or prior to the Compensation and Management Development Committee s Certification regarding satisfaction of the FY[          ] performance conditions, the performance-based restricted stock unit right will be deemed fully earned at target (100%) immediately prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or the change in control, as the case may be, and will be settled in fully vested Cisco common stock at that time. 
  Lastly, please note that, if you are employed outside the United States, the Compensation and Management Development Committee can grant the PRSU Right to you, in its sole discretion, only if and as long as it is permitted and feasible to grant restricted stock units under the laws of the country in which you are employed. If local laws make the grant of restricted stock units illegal or impractical, Cisco will let you know as soon as possible. You are under no obligation to accept the PRSU Right or any restricted stock units that may subsequently be granted to you.

Deferral Election for 
  Annual Equity Award 
  2005 Stock Incentive Plan 

I understand: 

To the extent I do not elect to defer the settlement of my restricted stock unit grant, such portion of the restricted stock unit grant will be automatically settled in shares of the Company s common stock upon the vesting of the restricted stock unit grant (subject to acceleration in certain cases), as more fully set forth in the Stock Unit Agreement. 

Any vested portion of the deferred restricted stock unit grant will be settled in shares of the Company s common stock as elected by me above. 

If my Separation from Service occurs before my restricted stock unit grant vests, any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited as of the date my Separation from Service occurs. 

Separation from Service  is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). While separation from service generally means termination of employment, a Separation from Service can also occur in the case of certain leaves of absence or upon a significant reduction in my work schedule. These events can trigger a  Separation from Service  resulting in the forfeiture of my unvested restricted stock units. 

Certain leaves of absence can result in the suspension of vesting of my unvested restricted stock units. If I take a leave of absence that suspends the vesting of my restricted stock units such that they are unvested as of the applicable distribution event (whether that is Separation from Service or a date specific I elected), my restricted stock units that are unvested at the time of such distribution event shall be forfeited. 

Any employment taxes that are due upon the vesting of my restricted stock unit grant (including the deferred portion of my grant) shall be deducted at the time of vesting by one or a combination of the following: 

(1) 
    withholding from my wages or other cash compensation payable to me by the Company or the Employer; 

(2) 
    withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares acquired upon settlement of the restricted stock units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on my behalf pursuant to this authorization); 

(3) 
    withholding of shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the restricted stock units; or 

(4) 
    requiring me to satisfy the liability for any employment taxes by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company. 

The receipt of shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to any restricted stock unit grant will be taxed as ordinary income to me based on the value of the shares on the date the stock unit grant is settled and I receive shares of the Company s common stock. This is true whether or not I elect to defer settlement of my restricted stock units. 

The settlement of the deferred portion of my annual restricted stock unit grant upon my Separation from Service will be delayed for six     months.

    1.        Stock Units  .  Pursuant to the Plan, the Company hereby grants to you, and you hereby accept from the Company, Stock Units, each of which is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent in value of one (1) Share, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan.

You represent, warrant and acknowledge that the Company has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the income tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company or the Company s representatives for an assessment of such tax consequences.

  6.        Restriction on Transfer  .  Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Stock Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such  

restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law. 
    7.        Stock Certificate Restrictive Legends  .    Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends as the Company and the Company s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement. 
    8.        Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments  .  You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable securities laws. 
    9.        Voting, Dividend and Other Rights  .  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and except as set forth below, you shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a shareholder of the Company unless and until the Stock Units are settled upon your Separation from Service.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  VESTING ACCELERATION POLICY 
  FOR 
  DEATH AND TERMINAL ILLNESS 
  AS AMENDED JANUARY 27, 2016 
  Unless and until the Compensation   Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all outstanding equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including outstanding equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an  equity award ), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited any applicable law, rule or regulation or would result in adverse legal or tax consequences thereunder. 
  For purposes of this policy: 

the value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is based on the difference between the exercise price of the equity awards and the closing price of Cisco s stock on the date of the employee s death or terminal illness, as applicable, or if such day is not a trading day, the last trading day prior to the date of death or terminal illness, as applicable;  

the value of stock grants, stock units, and unvested shares previously acquired pursuant to equity awards (such shares are referred to herein as  unvested equity award shares ) is based on the difference between the purchase price, if any, and the closing price of Cisco s stock on the date of the employee s death or terminal illness, as applicable, or if such day is not a trading day, the last trading day prior to the date of death or terminal illness, as applicable; 

unvested equity award shares  includes outstanding and unvested performance-based restricted stock or stock unit awards and the accelerated vesting of such awards will be deemed to occur at target levels, subject to the specified limits below; and 

to the extent the vesting of any performance-based restricted stock or stock unit award is accelerated pursuant to this policy, the award will be settled upon the death or terminal illness of an employee, as the case may be, except that if the applicable award is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ( Code Section 409A ) and such terminal illness does not qualify as a  Disability  within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then the award will instead be settled on the fixed payment date following the end of the performance period on which the applicable award is normally paid out. 

ACCELERATION UPON DEATH OF EMPLOYEE 
  Upon the death of an employee, Cisco will accelerate the vesting of the employee s outstanding equity awards and any unvested equity award shares up to a specified limit based on the value of the equity awards and/or shares on the date of death. The limit on the amount of accelerated vesting is the greater of: (a) one-hundred percent (100%) of the unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares up to a total value of $10 million; or (b) up to one year of vesting from the date of death as to all unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares. For example, if an employee held unvested options for 100,000 shares with an exercise price of $1 which would vest in four annual installments of 25,000 shares, and the closing price of Cisco s stock on the date of the employee s death was $101, all 100,000 of the shares would become vested (100,000 shares x $100 (the difference between $101 and $1) = $10,000,000). 
  ACCELERATION UPON TERMINAL ILLNESS OF EMPLOYEE 
  Upon the terminal illness of an employee, Cisco will accelerate the vesting of the employee s outstanding equity awards and any unvested equity award shares up to a specified limit based on the value of the equity awards and/or shares on the date of the terminal illness. An employee will be considered terminally ill upon the approval by Cisco s employee life insurance provider of the accelerated life insurance benefit which indicates 12 months or less to live. When a request is made to accelerate the vesting of an employee s outstanding equity awards and early life insurance payouts are not also requested, an employee will be considered terminally ill upon the approval by Cisco s external, independent medical review vendor (which may include Cisco s employee life insurance provider). The date of terminal illness will be the date the determination is made by Cisco s employee life insurance provider or Cisco s external, independent medical review vendor. The limit on the amount of accelerated vesting is the greater of: (a) one-hundred percent (100%) of the unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares up to a total value of $10 million; or (b) up to one year of vesting from the date of the terminal illness as to all unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares. For example, if an employee holds unvested options for 100,000 shares with an exercise price of $1 which would vest in four annual installments of 25,000 shares, and the closing price of Cisco s stock on the date that the employee is determined to be terminally ill was $101, all 100,000 of the shares would become vested (100,000 shares x $100 (the difference between $101 and $1) = $10,000,000). 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  VESTING POLICY 
  FOR 
  LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
  AS  AMENDED JANUARY 27, 2016 
  Unless and until the Compensation   Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all outstanding equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including outstanding equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an  equity award ), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or would result in adverse legal or tax consequences thereunder. 
  90 DAYS CONTINUED VESTING ON AUTHORIZED LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
  The exercise or vesting schedule in effect for any outstanding equity award and any unvested shares previously acquired pursuant to any equity award (such shares referred to herein as  unvested equity award shares ) held by an employee at the time of the employee s commencement of an authorized leave of absence shall continue to vest and/or become exercisable in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable equity award agreement during the period the employee remains on such authorized leave of absence; provided that, in no event shall any employee be entitled to vest for more than 90 days of authorized leaves of absence during any rolling 12-month period (the  LOA Limit ). 
  If an employee exceeds the LOA Limit during any rolling 12-month period, the unvested equity award shares held by such an employee shall be suspended immediately following the expiration of the LOA Limit and the equity award and any unvested equity shares shall not vest and/or become exercisable for any additional shares during the remainder of the rolling 12-month period. 

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 
  TRANSFER POLICY 
  FOR 
  DIVORCE 
  Unless and until the Compensation   Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an  equity award ), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited by the applicable equity plan, equity award agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation. 
  PROHIBITION ON TRANSFER OF EQUITY AWARDS UPON DIVORCE 
  Except as provided below, equity awards and any unvested shares acquired pursuant to equity awards shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor s process in connection with the divorce of the holder of such equity award or shares. Equity awards and any unvested shares acquired pursuant to equity awards may be transferred by an executive officer of Cisco only to the extent required by a domestic relations order, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, in settlement of marital property rights by any court of competent jurisdiction.

The relocation elements of the compensation package are contingent upon your execution of the attached Relocation Agreement and compliance with the terms of that Agreement.   No substitutions or cash outs   for any of the provided relocation components are permitted. 
    
  Other Transfer Terms and Conditions 
    
  Code of Business Conduct 
  In order to commence your transfer, you must have executed the most recent Code of Business Conduct. 
    
  Taxes, Tax Orientation and Tax Return Services 
  Taxes 
  Effective with your transfer date, you will be responsible for all national and local income taxes as well as social taxes in San Jose, California, United States.   
    
  Failure to comply may create issues with visa renewals, incur tax penalties which will be your responsibility and even in severe cases, involve penal punishment.   
    
  The Tax Gross-up Policy may be applied when the transfer related remuneration and services you receive under the International Transfer   Managed Move policy requires the company to provide the remuneration or services as a guaranteed net payment after taxes are deducted.  Tax Gross-up is however limited to income and social taxes, and to a limited extent, the exit taxes in effect in certain countries.  Please review the Tax policy for further details. 
    
  Tax Orientation 
  Cisco has retained an international tax firm, Ernst   Young, to assist you with the understanding of your taxes, both in the current location (departure country) and new location (destination country).  Please contact Ernst   Young s Tax Department at _____________ to arrange a tax orientation meeting. 
    
  You are required to meet with the tax vendor consultants both at current and new locations prior to beginning your transfer.  These meetings are critically important to ensure tax and legal compliance are met and any risk for the Company due to your transfer is effectively managed.  To that end, your transfer related remuneration will not commence until the tax orientation meeting in the current location is conducted.  If you engage Ernst   Young for personal financial planning and other tax services, the fees associated with those services shall be borne by you personally. 
    
  Tax Return Services 
  In addition to the tax orientation, if approved, Cisco has retained Ernst   Young, to assist you with the preparation and filing of your taxes, both in the current location (departure country) and new location (destination country).  The years of coverage are determined by the policy.  Please contact Ernst   Young s Tax Department at ____________ to arrange tax preparation services. 
    
  This letter, together with its attachments,   states our entire understanding of your transfer remuneration and services.    However, this letter does not modify, amend or supersede written Cisco agreements and policies that are consistent with enforceable provisions of this letter such as Cisco's "Proprietary Information and Invention Agreement" and Cisco's Arbitration Agreement.  In addition, this letter, its attachments and their contents do not modify or supersede any local laws which may prohibit the application of other policies  

deemed corporate policies of Cisco Systems, Inc. such as the International Transfer Managed Move policy or the Tax Policy.  You should not sign this letter unless you understand it.  You should also be aware that some listed provisions may be changed from time to time as legal requirements may dictate, new practices may require, or for other reasons at the discretion of the Company.      In the event this should happen, notification will be provided.  If questions should arise concerning any provision listed or any subsequent revisions to policies applicable to employees on international transfer, you are urged to consult with your Cisco's Relocation Services Provider, or your Cisco Relocation Advisor, Sara Modena.

Relocation Payback Agreement 
    
  I understand and agree that Cisco Systems, Inc. ( Cisco ) may, in its sole discretion, require that I provide acceptable documentation of some or all of my relocation expenses before reimbursing me for those expenses.   
    
  I further understand and agree that Cisco's obligation to make any relocation payment(s) is contingent upon my continued employment with the Company.  If I voluntarily terminate my employment within the first 24 months of my relocation, I agree to pay back all relocation payments advanced to me or on my behalf by Cisco in a prorated monthly amount. 
    
  In the event of involuntary termination without cause or for cause arising from a restructuring, no reimbursement is required.  However, in the event that my employment is involuntarily terminated during the 24 months of employment in the host location for good cause arising from anything other than a restructuring or early retirement plans, I agree to repay Cisco for the relocation costs Cisco advanced to me or on my behalf in accordance with the formula set forth above for voluntary terminations.  A termination for    Good Cause    will mean a termination for any of the following reasons:  (i) your continued material failure to perform your duties to Cisco (other than due to your death or disability after there has been delivered to you a written demand for performance which describes the specific material deficiencies in your performance and the specific manner in which your performance must be improved, all in accordance with the Cisco performance management plan, and which provides thirty (30) business days from the date of notice, or the amount of time specified in any applicable Cisco performance management plan, whichever is greater, to remedy such performance deficiencies; (ii) your engaging in an act of willful misconduct that has had or will have a material adverse effect on Cisco's reputation or business; (iii) your being convicted of, or a plea of no contest to, a felony; (iv) your committing an act of fraud against, or willful misappropriation of property belonging to, Cisco; or (v) your material breach of the Cisco Code of Business Conduct, Conflict of Interest Agreement or Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement. 
    
  In the event that the relocation is cancelled, whether by Cisco or voluntarily by me, I agree to repay Cisco for any funds advanced or benefits paid on my behalf.  In cases where the relocation is cancelled by Cisco, I agree to provide receipts as proof of the relocation costs incurred in preparation for the move. 
    
  I further agree to re-affirm this authorization in writing in the event that my employment is terminated during the first 24 months of employment in the new location, either voluntarily or involuntarily for cause other than a restructuring.   

I agree to pay the balance in full to Cisco within thirty (30) days of my termination date. 

You are encouraged to seek tax advice from your personal tax advisor at your own expense to determine the impact of any relocation payments upon your individual tax liability.  You are also encouraged to save all of your relocation expense receipts for tax purposes.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER TAX POLICY AGREEMENT

  I understand and agree that all tax positions affecting income, deductions and credits outside the scope of the Tax Policy (i.e., amounts not covered by the Tax Policy) are the responsibility of the employee.  Cisco is not liable for any taxes, penalties, or interest resulting from a successful challenge by any tax authority of any item not covered by the Tax Policy. 
    
  In addition, I understand the employee is fully responsible for all penalties and interest charges assessed by any tax authority due to the employee s failure to (1) provide information to Cisco s tax vendor, Ernst   Young, on a timely basis, (2) notify Ernst   Young of any significant personal income or investment transactions, or (3) cooperate with Cisco with respect to the tax gross-up process. 
    
  If I fail to furnish tax records in response to a request by Cisco pursuant to the Tax Policy, or cease employment with Cisco or any of its subsidiaries for any reason before the tax records needed to complete the year-end tax protection reconciliation under the Tax Policy are available, then Cisco shall have the right to calculate such amounts by making reasonable assumptions of probable taxes.  
    
  By signing, I accept all terms and conditions of this Tax Policy Agreement.

Effective January 1, 2013 this Plan was amended and restated to make certain changes to the administrative provisions of the Plan.

The Participant may (but is not required to) elect, by completing an Election Form in accordance with such rules and procedures established by the Company, to add or delete one or more Measurement Fund(s) to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or debited to his or her Account Balance, or to change the portion of his or her Account Balance allocated to each previously or newly elected Measurement Fund.  If an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply as of the first business day deemed reasonably practicable by the Company, in its sole discretion, and shall continue thereafter for each subsequent day in which the Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the previous sentence.

her Account Balance thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Account Balance   shall     not   be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her Account Balance in any such Measurement Fund.  In the event that the   Company   in its own discretion decides to invest funds in any or all of the investments on which the Measurement Funds are based, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves.  Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Account Balance shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his or her behalf by the Company; the Participant shall at all times remain an unsecured creditor of the Company.

    Annual Deferrals, Company Matching Amounts and Discretionary Company Contribution Amounts  .  For each Plan Year in which an Annual Deferral Amount is being withheld from a Participant or the amount of any Company Matching Amount or Company Discretionary Contribution Amount credited to a Participant's Company Contributions Account becomes vested, the Participant's Employer(s) shall withhold from that portion of the Participant's Base Salary, Bonus and/or Commissions, that is not being deferred, in a manner determined by the Employer(s), the Participant's share of FICA and other employment taxes on such Annual Deferral Amount, Company Matching Amount and Discretionary Company Contribution Amount.  If necessary, the Participant's Annual Deferral Amount or the Participant's Company Contributions Account, as applicable, may be reduced to pay such taxes (and associated income tax withholdings) in accordance with Code Section 409A. 
              (b) 
    Distributions  .  The Participant's Employer(s) shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant under this Plan (including payments, if any, made pursuant to Section 14.16) all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes required to be withheld by the Employer(s) in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to be determined in the sole discretion of the Employer(s). 
              (c) 
    Income Inclusion Under Code Section 409A  .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may not receive a payout from the Plan to the extent that the Unforeseeable Emergency would not be consistent with Code Section 409A. 
              (c) 
    If a Participant's petition for payout from the Plan is approved, the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date shall occur within thirty (30) days after the beginning of the calendar quarter following the date of such approval (or at such later time permitted under Code Section 409A) and the Participant's deferrals under the Plan shall be terminated as of the date of such approval.

Reg.  1.401(k)-1(d)(3) for the Participant to obtain a hardship distribution from an Employer's 401(k) Plan.

Accordingly, each Employer reserves the right to terminate its participation in the Plan.  In addition, the Committee retains the right to terminate the Plan at any time.  In the event of the termination of an Employer's participation in the Plan (or the Committee's termination of the Plan as a whole), the termination shall occur in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

14.3 
    Employer's Liability  .  An Employer's liability for the payment of benefits shall be defined only by the Plan and the Plan Agreement, as entered into between the Employer and a Participant.

Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company may establish procedures for the payment of all or a portion of a Participant's Account balance pursuant to a domestic relations order which would otherwise qualify a  qualified domestic relations order  under Code Section 414(p) if this Plan were qualified under Code Section 401(a).

    Furnishing Information  .  A Participant or his or her Beneficiary will cooperate with the Company, Employer and/or the 401(k) Administration Committee (as applicable) by furnishing any and all information requested, and take such other actions as may be requested, in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and the payments of benefits hereunder.

              14.13 
    Validity  .  In case any provision of this Plan shall be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein. 
              14.14 
    Incompetent  .  If the Company determines in its discretion that a benefit under this Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that person's property, the 401(k) Administration Committee may direct payment of such benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or incapable person.  The Company may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit.  Any payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount. 
              14.15

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall interpret this provision in a manner that is consistent with Code Section 409A and other applicable tax law. 
              14.16 
    Distribution in the Event of Income Inclusion under Code Section 409A  .  If any portion of a Participant's Account Balance under this Plan is required to be included in income by the Participant prior to receipt due to a violation of the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Participant may petition the Company, as applicable, for a distribution of that portion of his or her Account Balance that is required to be included in his or her income.

    Cisco Systems, Inc.         
  2009 Deferred Compensation Plan 

shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Participant's Employer shall distribute to the Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to the portion of his or her Account Balance required to be included in income as a result of the failure of the Plan to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, which amount shall not exceed the Participant's unpaid vested Account Balance under the Plan.  Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the Participant's benefits to be paid under this Plan. 
           14.17 
    Deduction Limitation on Benefit Payments  .  If an Employer reasonably anticipates that the Employer's deduction with respect to any distribution from this Plan would be limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m), then to the extent deemed necessary by the Employer to ensure that the entire amount of any distribution from this Plan is deductible, the Employer may delay payment of any amount that would otherwise be distributed from this Plan.  Any amounts for which distribution is delayed pursuant to this Section 14.17 shall continue to be credited/debited with additional amounts in accordance with Section 3.9 above.  The delayed amounts (and any amounts credited thereon) shall be distributed to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) at the earliest date the Employer reasonably anticipates that the deduction of the payment of the amount will not be limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m).
