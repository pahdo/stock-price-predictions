NOTE 1 - BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. The information furnished in the interim
condensed financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management,
are necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. Although management believes the disclosures and information
presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these interim condensed financial statements
be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its December 31, 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for year ending December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since
inception, has negative cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited
for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies. 

NOTE 3 - RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT 

On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development
Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from
US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present
inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in
which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity
that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are
permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be
issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective
financial statements . 

NOTE 4   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events
from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no such events
that would have a material impact on the financial statements. 

In this report references to  Cancer Capital,   the
Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Cancer Capital Corp.  

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) encourages
companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment
decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as  may,   intend,   expect, 
 believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,  or  continue  or comparable
terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important
factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Executive Overview   

We have not recorded revenues for the past two fiscal years and
we are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management,
significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing
funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue. 

As of the date of this report, our management has not had any discussions
with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may
be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established
records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially
unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity
in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. In
addition, any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution
to present stockholders of the Company. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will
be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries
and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming
a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available
business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task
of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to
raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that we
would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The
purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that
if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common
stock. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and
we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. We have relied primarily upon related
and third parties to provide and pay for professional and operational expenses. At September 30, 2016 we had $1,725 cash compared
to $598 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 total liabilities increased to $212,167 compared to $190,404 at December 31,
2015. This increase in total liabilities primarily represents an increase in notes payable, accrued interest and increases of cash
advances and accounts payable for consulting services and professional services provided by or paid for by a stockholder and third
parties. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders
and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our
ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity
and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect
our profitability for the long term. 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs
related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management,
significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert
debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations   

We did not record revenues in either 2016 or 2015. General and administrative
expense decreased to $11,173 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $12,690 for the 2015 nine month period. General and administrative
expense decreased to $2,700 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $2,900 for the 2015 third quarter. The decrease in general and
administrative expense for the 2016 nine month period was primarily due to reduced consulting services. 

Total other expense increased to $9,463 for the 2016 nine month
period compared to $8,480 for the 2015 nine month period. Total other expense increased to $3,211 for the 2016 third quarter compared
to $2,876 for the 2015 third quarter. Total other expense represents accrued interest related to notes payable. 

Our net loss decreased to $20,636 for the 2016 nine month period
compared to $21,170 for the 2015 nine month period. Our net loss increased to $5,911 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $5,776
for the 2015 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations   

At September 30, 2016 we recorded notes payable totaling $78,075
and notes payable-related party of $83,225. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on
demand. During the 2016 nine month period we borrowed $7,000 from a third party. 

At September 30, 2016 accounts payable increased to $13,700. During
the 2016 nine month period a stockholder provided or paid for consulting services and professional services totaling $5,300. 

As of September 30, 2016, two lenders represent
in excess of 95% of our accounts and notes payable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will
not be required to: 

Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   

Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency    

Obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and   

Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance
and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.   

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of
this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with
such new or revised accounting standards. 

We will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to
five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed
$1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued
more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties
to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate
this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting 

 (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management
conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
