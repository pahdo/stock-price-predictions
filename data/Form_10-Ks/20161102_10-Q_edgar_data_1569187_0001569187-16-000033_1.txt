2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented. 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the requirements for interim financial information. Accordingly, these interim financial statements have not been audited and exclude certain disclosures required for annual financial statements. Also, the operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. These interim  
  
   6 

Table of Contents  

financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Such estimates are based on management s historical experience and best judgment after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from management s estimates. 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the accounting principles described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , among others. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new standard that provides a single, comprehensive model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard could change the way the Company recognizes revenue from construction and development contracts with third party customers. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new revenue recognition standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued new consolidation guidance that changes: (i) the identification of variable interests, (ii) the variable interest entity ( VIE ) characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (iii) primary beneficiary determination. The amended guidance also eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2016 with no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued a new lease standard that requires lessees to recognize most leases in their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new standard also makes targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application with an option to use certain transition relief. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new lease standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying that the novation of a derivative contract in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedge accounting relationship.  Hedge accounting relationships could continue as long as all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met, including the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective when the creditworthiness of the new counterparty 
  to the derivative contract is considered. The new guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, and may be applied prospectively, or the Company may use a modified retrospective approach. Management does not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an investment that it had accounted for by another method initially qualifies for the equity method. The new guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that will change the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.  Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, and allows the Company to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The new guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that modifies the accounting for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments.  This new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of information to inform credit loss estimates.  The  
  
   7 

Table of Contents  

new guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  This guidance should be applied retrospectively to each period presented.  This new guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    

3.    Segments  
    
  Net operating income (segment revenues minus segment expenses) is the measure used by the Company s chief operating decision-maker to assess segment performance. Net operating income is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. As a result, net operating income should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate net operating income in the same manner. The Company considers net operating income to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations of the Company s real estate and construction businesses. 
    
  Net operating income of the Company s reportable segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (in thousands):  

General contracting and real estate services revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   exclude revenue related to intercompany construction contracts of   $7.8 million   and   $40.7 million  , respectively.  General contracting and real estate services expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   exclude expenses related to intercompany construction contracts of   $7.6 million   and   $40.2 million  , respectively. General contracting and real estate services expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include noncash stock compensation expense of less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.

General contracting and real estate services revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   exclude revenue from intercompany construction contracts of   $11.4 million   and   $27.9 million  , respectively. General contracting and real estate services expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   exclude expenses for intercompany construction contracts of   $11.3 million   and   $27.7 million  , respectively. General contracting and real estate services expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   include noncash stock compensation expense of less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following table reconciles net operating income to net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):  

General and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include noncash stock compensation expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. General and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   include noncash stock compensation expense of   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. 

4.    Real Estate Investments  
    
  Operating Property Acquisitions 
    
  In connection with operating property acquisitions, the Company identifies and recognizes all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations to tangible assets, such as land, site improvements, and buildings and improvements, are presented within income producing property in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Acquired lease intangibles are presented within other assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and amortized over their respective lease terms. The Company expenses all costs incurred related to operating property acquisitions. The Company values land based on a market approach, looking to recent sales of similar properties, adjusting for differences due to location and the state of entitlement as well as the shape and size of the parcel. Improvements to land are valued using a replacement cost approach, which applies industry standard replacement costs adjusted for geographic specific considerations and reduced by estimated depreciation. The value of buildings acquired is estimated using the replacement cost approach, assuming the buildings were vacant at acquisition. The replacement cost approach considers the composition of the structures acquired, adjusted for an estimate of depreciation. The estimate of depreciation is made considering industry standard information and depreciation curves for the identified asset classes. The value of acquired lease intangibles considers the estimated cost of leasing the properties as if the acquired buildings were vacant, as well as the value of the current leases relative to market-rate leases. The in-place lease value is determined using an estimated total lease-up time and lost rental revenues during such time. The value of current leases relative to market-rate leases is based on market rents obtained for comparable assets in the applicable markets.

  As part of the Southgate Square purchase agreement, the Company acquired an option to purchase an adjacent undeveloped land parcel from the seller.  The option for the land parcel is valid for an initial period of   two years  , and its value would be determined by applying a mutually agreed upon capitalization rate to the base rent of tenants provided by the seller and approved by the Company.  If, at the end of the   two  -year period, no suitable tenants have been found, the Company has the option of either paying   $3.0 million   to the seller for the land parcel or extending the period for an additional year. If, at the end of the additional year, no suitable tenants have been found, the Company can either pay   $1.25 million   to the seller for the land parcel or let the option expire.  Management has evaluated the option and determined that its value is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

  City Center 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the Company acquired a   37%   interest in Durham City Center II, LLC ( City Center ) for purposes of developing a   22  -story mixed use tower in Durham, North Carolina.

The Company has agreed to guarantee   37%   of the construction loan for City Center; however, the loan is collateralized by   100%   of the assets of City Center.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the construction loan has not been drawn against.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the difference between the carrying value of the Company s initial investment in City Center and the amount of underlying equity was immaterial. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , City Center did not have any operating activity, and therefore the Company did not receive any dividends or allocated income.  
    
  Based on the terms of City Center s operating agreement, the Company has concluded that City Center is a variable interest entity, and that the Company holds a variable interest. The Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the project that most significantly impact its performance.   Accordingly, the Company is not the project s primary beneficiary and, therefore, does not consolidate City Center in its consolidated financial statements.

interest rate on the AJAO loan will automatically be reduced to the interest rate on the senior construction loan. In the event the Company exercises the Second Option, AJAO is required to simultaneously repay any remaining amounts outstanding under the AJAO loan, with any excess proceeds received from the exercise of the Second Option applied against the remaining balance of the senior construction loan. In the event that the Company does not exercise either the First Option or the Second Option, the interest rate on the AJAO loan will automatically be reduced to the interest rate on the senior construction loan for the remaining term of the AJAO loan.

Effective March 31, 2016, the Company determined that the short-cut method of hedge accounting was not appropriate for   two   of its interest-rate swaps and, for accounting purposes, the hedge relationship was terminated. The swaps were entered into in February and July 2015. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the swap should have been recorded in income rather than other comprehensive income. The Company determined that the errors were immaterial to all previously issued financial statements. The Company recognized   $0.7 million   of accumulated other comprehensive income and   $0.4 million  , which was previously allocated to noncontrolling interest as of   December 31, 2015  , in earnings during the first quarter of 2016. Subsequent changes in the value of the interest rate swap for the period from   January 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016   were also recognized in earnings during the first, second and third quarters of 2016. Net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was overstated by   $0.6 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively.

9.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
    
  Fair value measurements are based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value is as follows:  
  Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  
  Level 2 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  
  Level 3 unobservable inputs  
  Except as disclosed below, the carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments approximate their fair value. Financial assets and liabilities whose fair values are measured on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of interest rate swaps and caps. The Company measures the fair values of these assets and liabilities based on prices provided by independent market participants that are based on observable inputs using market-based valuation techniques. 
    
  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  The fair value of the Company s long term debt is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 inputs is generally used to estimate the fair value of the Company s long term debt. Considerable judgment is used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. 
    
  The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments, all of which are based on Level 2 inputs, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands):

In addition, affiliated entities also reimburse the Company for monthly maintenance and facilities management services provided to the properties. Cost reimbursements earned by the Company from affiliated entities were   not   significant for either the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  
    
  The Operating Partnership entered into tax protection agreements that indemnify certain directors and executive officers of the Company from their tax liabilities resulting from the potential future sale of certain of the Company s properties within   seven   (or, in a limited number of cases,   ten  ) years of the completion of the Company s initial public offering and formation transactions completed on May 13, 2013. In addition, the tax protection agreements provide that the Operating Partnership will offer certain of the original contributors, including certain of the Company s directors and executive officers, the opportunity to guarantee debt, or, alternatively, to enter into a deficit restoration obligation, for   ten years   from the closing of the Company s initial public offering in a manner intended to provide an allocation of Operating Partnership liabilities to the partner for federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to these tax protection agreements, certain of the Company s executive officers have guaranteed   $0.3 million   of the Operating Partnership s outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition, the loan for the City Center joint venture is underwritten by a syndicate which includes Park Sterling Bank.  The Chief Executive Officer of Park Sterling Bank is the Chairman of the Company s Audit Committee. 

11.   Commitments and Contingencies  
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is from time to time involved in various disputes, lawsuits, warranty claims, environmental and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters. 
    
  The Company currently is a party to various legal proceedings, none of which management expects will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Management accrues a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, management accrues the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount within the range is accrued. Legal fees related to litigation are expensed as incurred. Management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations; however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. 
    
  Under the Company s leases, tenants are typically obligated to indemnify the Company from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against it as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant. 
    
  Commitments 
    
  The Company has a bonding line of credit for its general contracting construction business and is contingently liable under performance and payment bonds, bonds for cancellation of mechanics liens and defect bonds. Such bonds collectively totaled   $184.0 million   and   $183.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Operating Partnership has entered into standby letters of credit using the available capacity under the credit facility. The letters of credit relate to the guarantee of future performance on certain of the Company s construction contracts. Letters of credit generally are available for draw down in the event the Company does not perform. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Operating Partnership had total outstanding letters of credit of   $2.0 million   and   $8.0 million  , respectively.

Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. 
    
  We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the condensed consolidated statement of equity for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated March 2, 2016. In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words  anticipate,   believe,   expect,   intend,   may,   might,   plan,   estimate,   project,   should,   will,   result  and similar expressions, which do not relate solely to historical matters, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. 
    
  Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all).

    our failure to successfully operate developed and acquired properties;  
                
    our failure to generate income in our general contracting and real estate services segment in amounts that we anticipate;  
                
    fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs; 
                
    our failure to obtain necessary outside financing on favorable terms or at all;  
                
    our inability to extend the maturity of or refinance existing debt or comply with the financial covenants in the agreements that govern our existing debt;  
                
    financial market fluctuations;  
                
    risks that affect the general retail environment or the market for office properties or multifamily units;  
                
    the competitive environment in which we operate;  
                
    decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;  
                
    conflicts of interests with our officers and directors;  
                
    lack or insufficient amounts of insurance;

environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;  
                
    other factors affecting the real estate industry generally;  
                
    our failure to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  
                
    limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules in order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and  
                
    changes in governmental regulations or interpretations thereof, such as real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates and taxation of REITs. 
       
  While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as required by applicable law. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and urge investors to carefully review the disclosures we make concerning risks and uncertainties in the sections entitled  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and identified in other documents that we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).

Segment Results of Operations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated our business in four segments: (i) office real estate, (ii) retail real estate, (iii) multifamily residential real estate and (iv) general contracting and real estate services, which are conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ). Net operating income (segment revenues minus segment expenses), or  NOI , is the measure used by management to assess segment performance and allocate our resources among our segments. NOI is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. As a result, NOI should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations of our real estate and construction businesses. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of NOI to net income. 
    
  We define same store properties as those properties that we owned and operated and that were stabilized for the entirety of both periods presented. Same store properties exclude those that were in lease-up during either of the periods presented. We generally consider a property to be in lease-up until the earlier of: (i) the quarter after the property reaches 80% occupancy or (ii) the thirteenth quarter after the property receives its certificate of occupancy. 

Office Segment Data    

Office segment NOI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $2.4 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . This decrease is due to the sales of the Sentara Williamsburg, Richmond Tower and Oceaneering office buildings, which contributed $2.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in office segment NOI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . We completed the sale of the Sentara Williamsburg in the first quarter of 2015, the sale of the Oceaneering office building in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the sale of the Richmond Tower office building in the first quarter of 2016. 

Office Same Store Results 
    
  Office same store results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   exclude new real estate development   4525 Main Street   as well as the Sentara Williamsburg, Richmond Tower and Oyster Point office buildings, which we sold in the first quarter of 2015, the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2016, respectively.  
    
  Office same store rental revenues, property expenses and NOI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:  

Office same store NOI for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   1%   and   3%  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of contractual rent increases.  These increases were partially offset by

higher utility costs in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, these increases were also a result of lower utility costs driven by the milder winter of 2016 compared to 2015.

Real estate taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $0.3 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , as follows:  

Office real estate taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   due to the sales of the Sentara Williamsburg and Richmond Tower office buildings. Retail and multifamily real estate taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of acquisitions and increases from new tax assessments. 
    
  General contracting and real estate services expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   28%   and   17%  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of the timing and volume of work performed. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   41%   and   51%  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of property acquisitions. 
    
  General and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   15%   and   9%  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as higher compensation and benefit costs from increased employee headcount. 
    
  Acquisition, development and other pursuit costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Approximately less than $0.1 million and $0.7 million of the acquisition costs incurred in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were related to the 11 asset portfolio acquisition. Socastee Commons, Perry Hall Marketplace, Stone House Square, Columbus Village and Providence Plaza were acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Impairment charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were primarily due to lease terminations. These charges were not significant for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   17%   and   20%  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , primarily as a result of increased borrowings.  
    
  The change in fair value of interest rate derivatives for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    decreased   $0.5 million   and increased   $2.0 million  , respectively.  The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the increase in LIBOR, while the increase for the nine months ended was due to the $1.0 million adjustment made for interest rate derivatives.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   and less than $0.1 million, respectively, compared to less than $0.1 million and   $0.4 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  .  These losses represent the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with repaid mortgages and also in connection with the closing of our credit facility.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized gains of   $3.75 million   and   $30.4 million  , respectively, on our sales of Willowbrook Commons, Kroger Junction, the Richmond Tower office building, the Oyster Point office building and the Newport News Economic Authority building. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized gains of   $13.4 million   on our sales of the Sentara Williamsburg office building and Whetstone Apartments. 
    
  Income tax provisions that we recognized during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were attributable to the taxable profits and losses of our development and construction businesses that we operate through our TRS.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  We believe our primary short-term liquidity requirements consist of general contractor expenses, operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and leasing incentives, dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT qualification, debt service, capital expenditures, new real estate development projects and strategic acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash, borrowings under construction loans to fund new real estate development and construction, borrowings available under our credit facility and proceeds from the sale of common stock through our new at-the-market continuous equity offering program ( New ATM Program ), which is discussed below. 
    
  Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary for the repayment of debt at or prior to maturity, general contracting expenses, property development and acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property development and acquisitions and capital improvements using our credit facility pending long-term financing. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $23.9 million   available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities. We also had restricted cash of   $3.5 million   available for property improvements and required maintenance. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $48.0 million of available borrowings under our credit facility and $23.9 million available for future issuance under our New ATM Program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. 
    
  ATM Equity Offering Programs 
    
  On May 4, 2016, we commenced a new at-the-market continuous equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to   $75.0 million  . Upon commencing our New ATM Program, we simultaneously terminated our prior $50.0 million at-the-market continuous equity offering program (the "Prior ATM Program"), which we entered into in May 2015 and under which we sold an aggregate of   2,261,068   shares of common stock, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of   $23.1 million  . Our sale of shares under the New ATM Program will depend on a variety of factors, including among other things, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, capital needs and our determination of appropriate sources of funding. We have no obligation to sell any shares and may at any time suspend or terminate the New ATM Program. Each of our sales agents are entitled to a commission of up to 1.5% of the gross offering proceeds of shares that they sell through the New ATM Program. We intend to use any net proceeds from the sale of shares through the New ATM Program to fund development or redevelopment activities, fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under our credit facility, or for general corporate purposes. In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we raised   $19.9 million   of gross proceeds at a weighted average price of   $13.93   per share under the New ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds after offering costs and commissions of   $19.5 million  .   
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  On February 20, 2015, we entered into a   $200.0 million   senior unsecured credit facility that includes a   $150.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a   $50.0 million   senior unsecured term loan facility. The credit facility replaced the prior   $155.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on May 13, 2016. We intend to use future borrowings under the credit facility for general corporate purposes, including funding acquisitions, development and redevelopment of properties in our portfolio and for working capital. 
    
  The credit facility includes an accordion feature that allows the total commitments to be increased to $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. On January 5, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we increased the total borrowing capacity to $225.0 million and   $250.0 million  , respectively, using this feature. The amount permitted to be borrowed under the credit facility, together with all of our other unsecured indebtedness, is generally limited to the lesser of: (i) 60% of the value of our unencumbered borrowing base properties, (ii) the maximum amount of principal that would result in a debt service coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.0, and (iii) the maximum aggregate loan commitment, which currently is $250.0 million.

Table of Contents  

The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of February 20, 2019, with a one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions. The term loan facility has a scheduled maturity date of February 20, 2020. We may, at any time, voluntarily prepay any loan under the credit facility in whole or in part without premium or penalty. 
    
  The revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus   1.40%   to   2.00%  , depending on our total leverage. The term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus   1.35%   to   1.95%  , depending on our total leverage. We are also obligated to pay an unused commitment fee of 15 or 25 basis points on the unused portions of the commitments under the credit facility, depending on the amount of borrowings under the credit facility. If we attain investment grade credit ratings from S P and Moody s, we may elect to have borrowings become subject to interest rates based on our credit ratings. 
    
  On February 25, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility to, among other things, amend the maximum leverage ratio as set forth below. 
    
  The credit facility requires us to comply with various financial covenants, affirmative covenants and other restrictions, including the following: 
             
    Total leverage ratio of the Company of not more than 60% (or 65% for the two consecutive quarters following any acquisition that is equal to or greater than 10% of our total asset value (as defined in the credit agreement), but only up to two times during the term of the credit facility);  
                
    Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges of the Company of not less than 1.50 to 1.0;  
                 
    Ratio of variable rate indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 30%; 
                
    Ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 45%; and  
                
    Ratio of secured recourse debt to total asset value of not more than 25%. 
       
  The credit facility limits our ability to pay cash dividends. However, so long as no default or event of default exists, the credit agreement allows us to pay cash dividends with respect to any 12-month period in an amount not to exceed the greater of: (i) 95% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement) or (ii) the amount required for us (a) to maintain our status as a REIT and (b) to avoid income or excise tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If certain defaults or events of default exist, we may pay cash dividends with respect to any 12-month period to the extent necessary to maintain our status as a REIT. The credit facility also restricts the amount of capital that we can invest in specific categories of assets, such as unimproved land holdings, development properties, notes receivable, mortgages, mezzanine loans and unconsolidated affiliates. 
    
  We are currently in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility.

  Interest Rate Derivatives 
    
  We may use interest rate derivatives from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. Using an interest rate swap, we fixed our interest payments under North Point Center Note 5 at 3.57% through maturity on February 1, 2017. 
    
  On February 20, 2015, we entered into a $50.0 million floating-to-fixed interest rate swap attributable to one-month LIBOR indexed interest payments. The $50.0 million interest rate swap has a fixed rate of 2.00%, an effective date of March 1, 2016 and a maturity date of February 20, 2020. We entered into this interest rate swap agreement in connection with the $50.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility that bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.35% to 1.95%, depending on our total leverage. 
    
  On July 13, 2015, we entered into a $6.5 million floating-to-fixed interest rate swap attributable to one-month LIBOR indexed interest payments. The $6.5 million interest rate swap has a fixed rate of 3.05%, an effective date of July 13, 2015 and a maturity date of April 5, 2018. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were party to the following LIBOR interest rate cap agreements ($ in thousands):  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional amounts of our LIBOR interest rate cap agreements with strike rates below and above 1.25% were as follows ($ in thousands):  

On February 25, 2016, we entered into a LIBOR interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of   $75.0 million   at a strike rate of   1.50%   for a premium of less than   $0.1 million  .  The interest rate cap agreement expires on March 1, 2018. 
    
  On June 17, 2016, we entered into a LIBOR interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of   $70.0 million   at a strike rate of   1.00%   for a premium of less than   $0.1 million  .  The interest rate cap agreement expires on June 17, 2018. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have entered into standby letters of credit relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain of our construction contracts. Letters of credit generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had aggregate outstanding standby letters of credit totaling   $2.0 million   that expire during   2016  .

However, any of our standby letters of credit may be renewed for additional periods until completion of the underlying contractual obligation. 

Cash Flows 

Net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   120%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of increased net cash collected under our construction contracts and increased depreciation and amortization.  This increase was offset by a $17.0 million increase in the gain on real estate dispositions in 2016 when compared to the dispositions which occurred in 2015.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we invested   209%   more cash compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of our acquisitions of the 11 asset retail portfolio, Southgate Square and Southshore Shops, coupled with the mezzanine financing in Annapolis Junction. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   351%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of net proceeds from common stock sales and increased borrowing on the credit facility and refinancings. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
    
  FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. 
    
  However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs  calculation of FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. Also, FFO should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  We also believe that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company s operating property portfolio and affect the comparability of the Company s year-over-year performance. Accordingly, management believes that Normalized FFO is a more useful performance

measure that excludes certain items, including but not limited to, debt extinguishment losses and prepayment penalties, property acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, mark-to-market adjustments for interest rate derivatives and other non-comparable items. 
    
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO and Normalized FFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent:  

The adjustment for gain on real estate dispositions excludes the gain on the Newport News Economic Authority building because this building was sold before being placed in service. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to exercise our best judgment in making estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon then-currently available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We discuss the accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to understanding our reported financial results in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate exposure is LIBOR. We primarily use fixed interest rate financing to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. On a limited basis, we also use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. We do not use these derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $242.2 million  , or   46.6%  , of our debt had fixed interest rates and approximately   $277.0 million  , or   53.4%  , had variable interest rates. Assuming no increase in the level of our variable rate debt, if interest rates increased by 1.0%, our cash flow would decrease by approximately   $2.8 million   per year. At   September 30, 2016  , LIBOR was approximately   52   basis points. Assuming no increase in the level of our variable rate debt, if LIBOR was reduced to 0 basis points, our cash flow would increase by approximately   $1.5 million   per year. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,  
  
   34

including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of   September 30, 2016  , that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act: (i) is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
