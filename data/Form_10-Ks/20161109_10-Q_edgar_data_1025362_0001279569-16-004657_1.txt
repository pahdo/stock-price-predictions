  For the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

  (US dollars - Unaudited)  

Nature of Business   Golden Queen
Mining Co. Ltd. ( Golden Queen ,  GQM Ltd.  or the  Company ) is engaged in the development
and operation of the Soledad Mountain Project ( the Project ), located in the Mojave Mining District, Kern County,
California. The construction phase of the Project was completed in February 2016 and the Company commenced production in April
2016. 

The Company originally used its wholly owned
subsidiary, Golden Queen Mining Company, Inc. ( GQM Inc. ), to explore and develop the Project. On September 10, 2014,
GQM Inc. was converted to a limited liability company, Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC ( GQM LLC ). The Company entered
into a Joint Venture (the  JV ) agreement with Gauss LLC ( Gauss ) through its newly formed, wholly owned
subsidiary, Golden Queen Mining Holdings, Inc. ( GQM Holdings ). The JV was completed on September 15, 2014. Upon
completion of the JV, both the Company, through GQM Holdings, and Gauss each owned, and continue to own, 50% of GQM LLC. In February
2015, the Company incorporated Golden Queen Mining Canada Ltd. ( GQM Canada ), a wholly-owned British Columbia subsidiary,
to hold the Company s interest in GQM Holdings. 

Basis of Preparation   These unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The accounting policies followed in preparing these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements are those used by the Company as set out in the audited consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, with the exception of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02. This update was adopted
January 1, 2016 as described below under the recent accounting standards. 

Certain information and note disclosures normally
included for annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. These condensed
consolidated interim financial statements should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary (including reclassifications and normal recurring adjustments) to present fairly the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented, have been included in these financial
statements. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year ending December 31, 2016, or future
operating periods. For further information, see the Company s annual consolidated financial statements, including the accounting
policies and notes thereto. 

Judgements and Estimates   The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgements, estimates, and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
and judgements have been made by Management in several areas including the accounting for the joint venture transaction and determination
of temporary and permanent non-controlling interest, the recoverability of mineral properties expenditures, royalty obligations,
inventory valuations, ore on heap leach pads, ore reserves, mine plan, useful lives of assets, asset retirement obligations, convertible
debentures, and derivative liability - warrants. A key judgement for 2016 related to when the Soledad Mountain mine enters the
production phase. Generally, under US GAAP a mine would be considered to be in the production phase once it has demonstrated that
it is producing saleable quantities of product. The Company concluded that the Soledad Mountain mine began producing saleable
material in the second quarter of 2016. 

Principles of Consolidation   The
Company consolidates all entities in which it can vote a majority of the outstanding voting stock. In addition, it consolidates
entities which meet the definition of a variable interest entity for which it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary
is the party who has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s
economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that
could potentially be significant to the entity. We consider special allocations of cash flows and preferences, if any, to determine
amounts allocable to non-controlling interests. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 

These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements include the accounts of Golden Queen, a British Columbia corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, GQM Canada, GQM
Holdings, a US (State of California) corporation, and GQM LLC, a limited liability company in which Golden Queen has a 50% interest,
through GQM Holdings. GQM LLC meets the definition of a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ). Golden Queen has determined
it is the member of the related party group that is most closely associated with GQM LLC and, as a result, is the primary beneficiary
who consolidates GQM LLC.

Revenues    Revenue is recognized
when title to gold and silver passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title passes to the buyer based
on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely
traded commodity markets, for example, the London Bullion Market for both gold and silver, in an identical form to the product
sold. 

Recent Accounting Standards   

(i)  Effective August 2014, FASB issued
                                         ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40 -
                                         Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
                                         The update essentially requires management of all entities, for annual and interim periods,
                                         to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that
                                         raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern
                                         within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.   

If conditions or events raise substantial
doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand
all of the following: 

1.  Principal conditions or events
                                         that raised substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going
                                         concern (before consideration of management s plans).   

2.  Management s evaluation of
                                         the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability
                                         to meet its obligations.   

3.  Management s plans that alleviated
                                         substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   

If conditions or events raise substantial
doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration
of management s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is  substantial doubt
about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern  within one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued (or available to be issued). 

This update will come into effect
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is assessing
the impact of this standard. 

(ii)  In February 2015, the FASB issued
                                         ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
                                         which  focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations (public
                                         and private companies and not-for-profit organizations) that are required to evaluate
                                         whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number
                                         of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the standards and
                                         improves current GAAP by:   

Placing
                                         more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting
                                         organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances
                                         based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain criteria are met.   

Reducing
                                         the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling
                                         financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE).   

Changing
                                         consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that
                                         typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs.   

The ASU became effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2015, for public companies. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016. The Company assessed and concluded there was no impact on the Company with
the adoption of the new standard.

(iii)  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU
                                         2016-01, Financial Instruments   Recognition and measurement of financial assets
                                         and financial liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) which updates several aspects of recognition,
                                         measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments that
                                         are relevant to the Company are as follows:   

1.  Eliminate the requirement for
                                         public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
                                         estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured
                                         at amortized cost on the balance sheet.   

2.  Require public business entities
                                         to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
                                         disclosure purposes.   

3.  Require separate presentation
                                         of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
                                         asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying
                                         notes to the financial statements.   

The ASU will be effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard. 

(iv)  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
                                         Compensation   Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) which updates several aspects
                                         of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
                                         classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
                                         of cash flows.   

The ASU will be effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, for public companies. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard. 

In August 2015, the effective date
was deferred to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 31, 2017, and will be applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the consolidated
financial statements and disclosures. 

(vi)  In February 2016,
                                         FASB issued ASC 842 that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and corresponding
                                         lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than 12 months.
                                         The update, which supersedes existing lease guidance, will continue to classify leases
                                         as either finance or operating, with the classification determining the pattern of expense
                                         recognition in the income statement. 

The ASU will be effective for
annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is applicable on a modified retrospective
basis with various optional practical expedients. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements  

  For the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

  (US dollars - Unaudited)  

1.      Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     

The Company entered the
production phase and began generating revenues from operations during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company had an accumulated
deficit of $88,202,370 and a working capital deficit of $17,428,374 at September 30, 2016. Cash used in operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,105,079. 

Golden Queen, on a non-consolidated basis, currently does not
have sufficient funds to repay the $37,500,000 loan   
 (Note 7(ii)), plus the accrued interest, at the issuance date of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
However, in order to secure the necessary funds to meet this upcoming obligation and mitigate the going concern issue, management
is evaluating its options, including debt and equity, and to re-finance the June 2015 Loan which matures on December 8, 2016.
The Company raised gross proceeds of $12.2 million (C$16.1     million)
in July 2016 primarily to be used to repay a portion of the loan. 

While Golden Queen has been successful at
certain of these efforts in the past, there can be no assurance that future efforts will be successful. This raises substantial
doubt about this entity s ability to continue as a going concern. At the Project level, GQM LLC has sufficient funds to
meet its contractual obligations for the next twelve months. 

The Company s access to the net assets
of GQM LLC is determined by the Board of Managers of GQM LLC. The Board of Managers is not controlled by the Company and therefore
there is no guarantee that any access to the net assets of GQM LLC would be provided to the Company in order to continue as a
going concern. The Board of Managers of GQM LLC determine when and if distributions from GQM LLC are made to the holders of its
membership units at their sole discretion. 

These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be
material.

3.      Property, Plant, Equipment and Mineral Interests
                                         - Continued     

As at September 30, 2016, the Company
had capitalized depreciation of $3,559,886 (December 31, 2015 - $2,255,056    )
relating to assets used in the development of the mine. As the Company entered production on April 1, 2016, the Company began
amortising assets put into production on this date and also discontinued capitalizing depreciation. 

The Company capitalized a portion of the interest
expense related to the convertible debenture and notes payable in accordance with its accounting policy. As the Company entered
the production phase during the three months ended June 30, 2016, interest was no longer being capitalized. 

4.      Share Capital     

The Company s common shares outstanding are no par value,
voting shares with no preferences or rights attached to them. 

Common shares   2016   

In July 2016, the Company completed a financing
for gross proceeds of $12,193,298 (C$16,124,000) consisting of 11,120,000 units at a price of $1.10 (C$1.45) per unit. Each unit
consisted of one common share of the Company and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the
holder to acquire one additional common share of the Company at a price of C$2.00 per common share until July 25, 2019. The aggregate
fair value of the common share purchase warrants at the time of issuance was $2,377,315 (C$3,144,180), which was recorded as a
derivative liability and the Company allocated the remaining proceeds of $9,815,983 (C$12,979,820) to the common shares. 

In connection with the financing, the Company
also issued 757,700 common share purchase warrants to brokers with the same terms as the common share purchase warrants issued
with the financing units. The aggregate fair value of the common share purchase warrants issued to the brokers at the time of
issuance was $323,973 (C$428,479) which was recorded as a derivative liability. 

The fair value of the warrants was determined
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 

In addition, the Company incurred cash share
issue costs totalling $1,285,458 (C$985,303), which consisted of legal fees, commission and other direct financing costs. 

In connection with the guidance of ASC 815-40-15,
as the options and warrants are exercisable in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company they do not meet the
 fixed-for-fixed  criteria of the guidance. As a result, the Company was required to separately account for the common
share purchase warrants issued in connection with the financing noted above as a derivative instrument liability. (See note 9
  Derivative liability) 

Common shares   2015   

In March 2015, the Company issued 150,000
common shares to the former President of the Company for achieving two of the three milestones outlined in his management agreement
(See Note 6   Commitments and Contingencies). The common shares had a total fair value of $155,428 (Note 7(i)). The fair
value was based on the market price on the date of issuance.

Stock options    

The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. In accordance with the accounting standard for employees,
the compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which approximates the vesting
period. Compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees is amortized over the contract services period or, if
none exists, from the date of grant until the options vest. Compensation associated with unvested options granted to non-employees
is re-measured on each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

The following is a summary of stock option
activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015: 

No stock options expired during the three
or nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months ended September

5.      Asset Retirement Obligations and Financial
                                         Reclamation Assurance     

Financial Reclamation Assurance 

The Company is required to provide the Bureau
of Land Management, the State Office of Mine Reclamation and Kern County with a revised reclamation cost estimate annually. 
The financial assurance is adjusted once the cost estimate is approved.  The Company s provision for reclamation of
the property is estimated each year by an independent consulting engineer. This estimate, once approved by state and county authorities,
forms the basis for the reclamation financial assurance. The reclamation assurance provided as at September 30, 2016 was $1,464,592
(December 31, 2015 - $624,142). 

The Company is also required to provide financial
assurance with the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (the  Regional Board ) for closure and reclamation
costs related to the lined impoundments, which are defined as the Stage 1 heap leach pad, the overflow pond, and the solution
collection channel. The reclamation financial assurance estimate for as of September 30, 2016 is $1,210,889 (December 31, 2015
- $Nil).  

In addition to the above, the Company is required
to obtain and maintain financial assurance for initiating and completing corrective action and remediation of a reasonably foreseeable
release from the Project s waste management units as required by the Regional Board.  The reclamation financial assurance
estimate for as of September 30, 2016 is $278,240 (December 31, 2015 - $278,240).  

The Company entered into $3.0 million in surety
bond agreements in order to release its reclamation deposits and post a portion of the financial assurance due in 2016. The Company
pays a yearly premium. Golden Queen Ltd. has provided a corporate guarantee on the surety bonds.

Asset Retirement Obligation 

The total asset retirement obligation as of
September 30, 2016 is $1,268,541 (December 31, 2015 - $978,453).  

The Company estimated its asset retirement
obligations based on its understanding of the requirements to reclaim and clean-up its property based on its activities to date. 
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was an increase of $96,696 and $290,088 (Three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $278,240) to the asset retirement obligations. Of these totals, $74,167 and $245,029 was capitalized
to property, plant, equipment and mineral interests as the asset portion of the asset retirement obligation for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $71,892).  The remaining
amount of $22,529 and $45,059, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was expensed to operations as accretion
expense (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $Nil). The Company estimates that the cash outflows related
to these reclamation activities will be incurred primarily in 2028.   Reclamation provisions are measured at the expected
value of future cash flows discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate and adjusted for
inflation. The Company used a credit adjusted risk-free rate of 9.20% (December 31, 2015   9.20%) and an inflation rate
of 2.27% (December 31, 2015   2.27%). 

The following is a summary of asset retirement
obligations: 

6.      Commitments and Contingencies     

Property rent payments and Production Royalties  

The Company has acquired a number of mineral
properties outright. It has acquired exclusive rights to explore, develop and mine other portions of the Project under various
mining lease agreements with landowners.  

The Company is required to make property rent
payments related to its mining lease agreements with landholders, in the form of advance minimum royalties.  The total property
rent payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $Nil and $18,206 (three months ended September 30, 2015
  $8,539 and nine months ended September 30, 3015 - $68,706), and the Company expects to pay approximately $30,000 in property
rent payments in 2016. 

Production royalty payments commenced during
the first quarter of 2016. The Company has paid $345,184 and $406,147 in production royalties during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

There are multiple third party landholders
and the royalty amount due to each landholder over the life of the Project varies with each property.  

Finder s fee  

The Company has agreed to issue 100,000 common
shares as a finder s fee in connection with certain property acquisitions upon commencement of commercial production, as
defined in the agreement, at the Project. As of September 30, 2016, commercial production had not commenced and accordingly no
shares have been issued. 

Compliance with Environmental Regulations  

The Company s exploration and development
activities are subject to laws and regulations controlling not only the exploration and mining of mineral properties, but also
the effect of such activities on the environment. Compliance with such laws and regulations may necessitate additional capital
outlays or affect the economics of a project, and cause changes or delays in the Company s activities.

The Company may, from time to time, be involved
in legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that any adverse outcome of
existing claims, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

7.      Related Party Transactions     

Except as noted elsewhere in these consolidated
financial statements, related party transactions are disclosed as follows: 

(i)    Consulting Fees    

For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company paid $Nil and $201,312 to Mr. H. Lutz Klingmann for services as President of the Company. Included
in these consulting fees was $155,428 related to 150,000 bonus shares (Refer to Note 4   Share Capital). There were no consulting
fees paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid a total of $27,447 and $83,685 (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $44,732
and $81,584) to the three independent directors of the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Thomas
M. Clay did not receive director fees. 

(ii)    Notes Payable    

On January 1, 2014, the Company
entered into an agreement to secure a $10,000,000 loan (the  January 2014 Loan ). The January 2014 Loan was provided
by members of the Clay family, who are shareholders of the Company, including $7,500,000 provided by an investment vehicle managed
by Thomas M. Clay, a Director and insider of the Company. The January 2014 Loan had a twelve-month term and an annual interest
rate of 5%, payable on the maturity date. 

The January 2014 Loan was repaid
on a date that is less than 183 days before the maturity date. As a result, the Company paid the Lenders an additional charge
in the amount that is equivalent to 5% of the principal amount, plus interest on the principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum
accrued to the date the January 2014 Loan was repaid. The Company repaid $7,500,000 loan plus the $375,000 accrued interest and
$375,000 additional charge on December 31, 2014. 

The remaining balance of the loan,
$2,500,000, the accrued interest of $125,000 and the additional charge of $125,000, were paid on January 5, 2015. 

On December 31, 2014 the Company
also entered into a new loan (the  December 2014 Loan ) with the same parties for an amount of $12,500,000. The December
2014 Loan was due on demand on July 1, 2015 and bore an annual interest rate of 10% payable at the end of each quarter. The loan
was guaranteed by GQM Holdings, and secured by a pledge of the Company's interests in GQM Canada, GQM Canada s interest
in GQM Holdings and GQM Holdings' 50% interest in GQM LLC. 

The Company also incurred a
financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,000,000, of which $750,000 was paid on December 31, 2014 and the remaining
$250,000 was paid on January 5, 2015. The Company agreed to pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument
which amounted to $90,916. The total legal fees paid for the transaction were $118,695.

(ii)    Notes Payable - Continued    

On June 8, 2015, the Company amended
the December 2014 Loan to extend the maturity to December 8, 2016 and increased the principal amount from $12,500,000 to $37,500,000
(the  June 2015 Loan ). The Company also issued 10,000,000 common share purchase warrants exercisable for a period
of five years expiring June 8, 2020. The common share purchase warrants have an exercise price of $0.95. All other terms remained
the same as the December 2014 Loan. The Company also incurred a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,500,000,
all of which was paid on June 8, 2015. The Company agreed to pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument
which amounted to $46,408. The legal fees were expensed as the transaction met the definition of a debt extinguishment. The terms
of the registration rights remains unchanged as does the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the registration rights
being exercised. 

Interest payable relating to the June 2015 Loan as
at September 30, 2016 was $1,050,023 (December 31, 2015 - $969,645). Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the $1,050,023
interest payable was paid in cash. Please refer to Note 15 for complete details. 

(iii)    Share Purchase Warrants    

On June 8, 2015 the Company issued
10,000,000 share purchase warrants to the Clay family in connection with the June 2015 Loan. The share purchase warrants are exercisable
until June 8, 2020 at an exercise price of $0.95. Included in the June 2015 Loan agreement was an anti-dilution provision. If
the Company were to complete a financing at a share price lower than the exercise price of the share purchase warrants, the exercise
price of the share purchase warrants would be adjusted to match the price at which the financing was completed. 

The share purchase warrants meet
the definition of a derivative liability instrument as the exercise price is not a fixed price as described above. Therefore,
the settlement feature does not meet the  fixed-for-fixed  criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15. 

The fair value of the derivative
liability related to the share purchase warrants as at September 30, 2016 is $4,870,193 (December 31, 2015 - $2,498,269). The
derivative liability was calculated using an option pricing valuation model with the following assumptions:

The following table summarizes the
amortization of discounts and interest on loans and convertible debentures: 

The Company s loans were contracted
to fund significant development costs. The Company capitalizes a portion of the interest expense as it related to funds borrowed
to complete development activities at the Project site. 

*Komatsu is not a related party
and has only been included in the above table to reconcile the total interest expense incurred for the period to the amounts capitalized
and expensed.  

 **Interest capitalization ended
on March 31, 2016 as the mine went into production on April 1, 2016.

Variable Interest Entity  

In accordance with ASC 810-10-30,
the Company has determined that GQM LLC meets the definition of a VIE and that the Company is part of a related party group that,
in its entirety, would meet the definition of a primary beneficiary.   Although no individual variable interest holder
individually meets the definition of a primary beneficiary in the absence of the related party group, Golden Queen has determined
it is considered the member of the related party group most closely associated with GQM LLC.  As a result, the Company has
consolidated 100% of the accounts of GQM LLC in these consolidated financial statements, while presenting a non-controlling interest
portion representing the 50% interest of Gauss in GQM LLC on its balance sheet.  A portion of the non-controlling interest
has been presented as temporary equity on the Company s balance sheet representing the initial value of the non-controlling
interest that could potentially be redeemable by Gauss in the future. 

The net assets of GQM LLC as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Included in the assets
above, is $15,414,250     (December 31, 2015 - $31,531,853)
in      cash held as at September 30, 2016. The cash
in GQM LLC is directed specifically to fund working capital until the Project reaches positive cash flows. The liabilities of
GQM LLC do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary except in two situations. Please refer to notes
5 and 13 for details on the exceptions. 

Non-Controlling Interest  

   The
carrying value of the non-controlling interest is adjusted for net income and loss, distributions and contributions pursuant to
ASC 810-10 based on the same percentage allocation used to calculate the initial book value of temporary equity.

8.      Derivatives used as Hedging Instruments     

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company entered into a series of  zero-cost put/ call  collar contracts for gold with settlements scheduled
between September 30, 2016 and December 30, 2016 with an average floor price of $1,100 per ounce and an average ceiling price
of $1,320 per ounce. These derivative instruments were not designated as hedges by the Company and are recorded at their fair
value at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss. 

For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $206,239 and a loss of $115,395 (Three and nine months ended September
30, 2015 - $Nil and $Nil) in the statement of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) on these contracts. 

The following is a summary, by
maturity dates, of the Company s gold collar contracts outstanding as at September 30, 2016: 

The unrealized fair value of these
contracts at September 30, 2016 was a liability of $115,395 (December 31, 2015 - $Nil). 

9.      Derivative Liability     

On July 25, 2016, the Company issued
a total of 6,317,700 share purchase warrants with an exercise price of C$2.00. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 815-40-15,
the share purchase warrants met the criteria of a derivative instrument liability because they were exercisable in a currency
other than the functional currency of the Company and thus did not meet the  fixed-for-fixed  criteria of that guidance.
As a result, the Company was required to separately account for the share purchase warrants as derivative instrument liabilities
recorded at fair value and marked-to-market each period with the changes in the fair value each period charged or credited to
income. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company
had re-measured the share purchase warrants and determined the fair value of the derivative liability to be $2,165,550 using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 

As of September 30, 2016, the changes
of derivative liability for share purchase warrants are as follows:

10.      Supplementary Disclosures of Cash Flow Information     

11.      Financial Instruments     

All financial assets and financial liabilities
are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs are expensed when they are incurred, unless they are directly
attributable to the acquisition of qualifying assets, in which case they are added to the costs of those assets until such time
as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
are as follows: 

Level 1  
      Unadjusted quoted prices
    in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;   

Level 2  
      Quoted prices in markets that are not
    active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;

Level 3  
      Prices or valuation techniques that
    require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market
    activity).

of the loan agreements are for a term of four years, except one which is for three years, and are secured by the underlying asset
except for the mining drill loan for which GQM Ltd. has provided a corporate guarantee.

16.      Prior Periods Financial Restatements     

During the preparation of the deferred tax
calculations for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company found an accounting error in the calculation of the deferred income
taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014. The accounting error related to the recognition of a deferred tax liability resulting
from the dilution gain recorded in additional paid-in capital from the JV transaction (Note 7(v)). The impact of the error on
the financial statements as at September 30, 2015 is presented below. There was no impact on the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss or the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Soledad Mountain Project   

Overview  

The Company is an emerging gold and silver
producer utilizing an open pit, heap leach operation on its Soledad Mountain property, located just outside the town of Mojave
in Kern County in southern California. The Soledad Mountain Project (the  Project ) utilizes conventional open pit
mining methods and the cyanide heap leach and Merrill-Crowe processes to recover gold and silver from crushed, agglomerated ore. 

The Company closed a joint venture transaction
(the  Joint Venture Transaction ) with Gauss LLC ( Gauss ) pursuant to which it sold 50% of its ownership
in the Project for an investment of $110 million in September 2014. Gauss is a funding vehicle owned by entities controlled by
Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE: LUK) ( Leucadia ) and certain members of the Clay family, a shareholder group
which, at the time of the Joint Venture Transaction, collectively owned approximately 27% of the issued and outstanding shares
of Golden Queen (the  Clay Group ). Gauss is owned 70.51% by Gauss Holdings LLC ( Gauss Holdings , Leucadia s
investment entity) and 29.49% by Auvergne LLC ( Auvergne , the Clay Group s investment entity). 

Golden Queen Mining Co., Inc. ( GQM
Inc. ), a California corporation and the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was converted into a limited liability
company, Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC ( GQM LLC ) on September 10, 2014 in preparation for the formation of the
Joint Venture. Golden Queen Mining Holdings ( GQ Holdings ), the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, now owns
a 50% interest in GQM LLC and Gauss holds the remaining 50%. 

Please
refer to the Company s Form 10-K dated March 30, 2016 for information on the Project and the Joint Venture Transaction.  

The Company commenced commissioning of
the facilities in the last quarter of 2015. The first gold and silver dor  was poured, as part of the testing and commissioning
process, on March 1, 2016. Testing and commissioning continued in March 2016 and production commenced on April 1, 2016. 

Commissioning of the Facilities

Commissioning of the
crushing-screening plant commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 as scheduled.  Leaching of the agglomerated ore was initiated
in early February and the commissioning of the Merrill-Crowe facility was completed mid-February. A significant milestone was
achieved when the inaugural gold and silver dor  bar was poured on March 1, 2016. 

The crushing and screening
plant continued to be ramped up during the third quarter and 24-hour, 7-day per week operations commenced in June. Irrigation
rates of ore on the heap were at the upper level of anticipated flow. The Company anticipates achieving an average throughput
of 10,000-11,000 tons per day by the end of 2016. 

In accordance with US
GAAP, the Company started recognizing revenues and expenses related to the sale of metals in the second quarter of 2016. 

Please refer to the   Operating performance
  section below for further details. 

Feasibility Study   

The Company filed a technical report pursuant
to National Instrument 43-101   Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ( NI 43-101 ) titled  Soledad
Mountain Technical Report and Updated Feasibility Study  with an effective date of February 25, 2015 (the  Technical
Report ) on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ( SEDAR ) on February 27, 2015 and the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ( EDGAR ) on March 2, 2015. 

Please
refer to the Company s news release dated February 10, 2015 and Form 10-K dated March 30, 2016 for further details on the
Technical Report and updated feasibility study. The Technical Report and updated feasibility study are also available on the Company s
website or on SEDAR.  

The Center for Biodiversity Petition
to List the Mohave Shoulderband Snail as an Endangered Species   

On January 31, 2014, the Center for Biological
Diversity ( CBD ) filed an emergency petition (the  Petition ) with the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service ( USFWS ) asking the USFWS to list the Mohave Shoulderband snail as a threatened or endangered species. Citing
a report published more than 80 years ago, the Petition claims that the snail exists in only three places and that most of the
snail habitat occurs on Soledad Mountain, where the Company is developing the Project. 

The Company worked with its environmental
and legal advisors to prepare a detailed response to the petition, which was filed with the USFWS on March 31, 2014. The Company s
response is available on the Company s website at www.goldenqueen.com. 

On April 22, 2014, the Company learned
that the USFWS had determined that there is no emergency to justify listing the Mohave Shoulderband snail as threatened or endangered
under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The USFWS reviewed the petition filed by the CBD and concluded that there
was no imminent threat to the snail that would cause them to believe an emergency listing was required. 

Even though an emergency listing was not
warranted, the USFWS is required by the Endangered Species Act to continue processing the listing petition. A public comment period
on the petition commenced on April 10, 2015 for a period of 60 days. On September 9, 2015, the USFWS and the CBD entered into a
Stipulated Settlement Agreement that established a 12 Month Finding date of April 11, 2016. 

In November 2015, the Company, the USFWS,
and the CBD entered into a Memorandum of Understanding under which the USFWS and the CBD agreed to defer the 12 Month Finding date
to June 30, 2017, and the Company agreed not to disturb until June 30, 2017 certain points on Soledad Mountain where snails or
snail shells had been identified. The Company, the USFWS, and the CBD have jointly selected a third party environmental consultant
that will conduct a survey to better understand the snail s range and distribution on Soledad Mountain before the USFWS prepares
its 12 Month Finding. Surveying is anticipated to take place between the fall of 2016 and the spring of 2017. 

The ongoing review by the USFWS does not
affect the Project s regulatory approvals or interfere with the Project s operation. The November 2015 Memorandum of
Understanding caused no material adjustments to the Project s mine plan. The Company believes that conservation of any snail
habitat areas can be accomplished without material adjustments to the Project s mine plan and is preparing a conservation
plan accordingly. If the USFWS ultimately finds that the snail is  endangered  or  threatened  and no agreed
conservation plan is established, material adjustments to the Project s mine plan may be required. 

Other Legal Matters   

National Labor Relations Board 

The Company filed a charge with the National
Labor Relations Board (the  NLRB ) against the Building and Construction Trades Council of Kern, Inyo, and Mono Counties
(the  Union ) on May 23, 2014. The charge was in response to the action taken by the Union related to a 1997 project
labor agreement (PLA) that the Company believes is not applicable to the Project and unenforceable under federal labor law. 

The NLRB issued a Complaint against the
Union and the matter was heard by an NLRB Administrative Law Judge resulting in a December 2015finding by the judge that the PLA
violates Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act and is therefore unenforceable. The Union has appealed that decision
to the NLRB in Washington, D.C., and the North America s Building Trades Unions have filed an amicus curiae brief in support.
The Company has filed its Responses to both briefs. 

Results of Operations   

The following are the results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the corresponding periods ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company had $13,450,545 and $16,914,638
revenues from operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company incurred general and administrative
expenses of $657,305 and $3,166,970 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $672,738 and $3,403,485
for the same periods in 2015. Costs were lower by $15,433 and $236,515 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
when compared with the same periods in 2015. The reasons for the variance in costs are highlighted below. 

The following significant general and
administrative expenses were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

$544,503
                                         (2015 - $372,976) for audit, tax and accounting fees. Audit and accounting costs were
                                         higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
                                         in 2015 mainly due to the increased complexity of the audit work as the Soledad Mountain
                                         entered production and the additional costs relating to the calculations of the deferred
                                         tax liability.   

$355,756
                                         (2015 - $217,515) for insurance expenses. The insurance expense increase is related to
                                         the general increase in corporate and site activities. Enhanced insurance coverage is
                                         required because construction of the processing facilities is complete and the Project
                                         has transitioned into the production phase.   

$Nil
                                         (2015 - $201,312) for consulting expenses. The 2015 consulting fees were payments for
                                         the services provided by the Company s former CEO. The current CEO salary is now
                                         included under corporate salary.   

The following significant general and
administrative expenses were incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

$115,980
                                         (2015 - $81,613) for insurance expenses. The insurance expense increase is related to
                                         the general increase in corporate and site activities. Enhanced insurance coverage is
                                         required because construction of the processing facilities is complete and the Project
                                         has transitioned into the production phase.   

The Company experienced net foreign exchange
gains of $273,470 and $271,365 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with gains of $319,600 and
$786,688 for the same period in 2015. The net foreign exchange gain is made up by realized and unrealized gains and losses related
to the Company s Canadian expenditures, the Canadian balances of cash, accounts payable and, in 2015, the convertible debentures.
During the third quarter of 2015 the net foreign exchange gain was mainly the result of the unrealized gain on the convertible
debentures, which were denominated in Canadian dollars while the Company s functional currency is the US dollar. The exchange
rate, stated in US dollar per one Canadian dollar, moved from $0.72 as of December 31, 2015 to $0.76 on September 30, 2016. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company incurred a total interest expense of $1,814,561 and $4,369,026 respectively (three months ended September
30, 2015 - $981,390, nine months ended September 30, 2015   $2,999,254) related to its various loans. The increase is mainly
due to the amortization of the discount of the June 2015 Loan (as defined in the   Transactions with Related Parties  
section below) and the fact that the Company no longer capitalizes a portion of the interest payable. Please refer to the   Transaction
with Related Parties   section for a complete breakdown of the interest expenses. 

During the third quarter of 2016 the amount
of the Company s derivative liability includes the warrants issued in conjunction with the June 2015 Loan and the fair value
of hedging instruments and the warrants issued in conjunction with the July 2016 financing. During the third quarter of 2015 the
Company s derivative liability included the convertible debentures and the warrants issued in conjunction with the June 2015
Loan. The Company recorded a decrease in the derivative liability including foreign exchange of $3,944,411 mostly as a result of
a decrease in the Company s share price during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to an increase of $598,770
for the same quarter in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an increase in the derivative
liability including foreign exchange of $1,951,581 as a result of a significant increase in the Company s share price during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a decrease of $1,868,329 for the same period in 2015. Refer to Notes 7(iii),
8 and 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for a detailed analysis of the changes in fair value
of the derivative liability. 

Interest income of $33,313 (2015 - $49,805)
was lower during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the same period in 2015 due to a decrease in the cash
balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the interest income was $116,215 (2015 - $168,330) as compared with the
same period in 2015 also due to a decrease in the cash balances. Interest rates remained low during the second quarter and are
projected to remain low for the remainder of 2016. 

The Company recorded net income and comprehensive
income of $2,738,207* and a net loss and comprehensive loss of $8,296,349* (or $0.03 and $(0.08) income and (loss) per basic share)
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively as compared to a net loss and comprehensive loss of $1,924,167*
and $4,739,168* respectively (or $0.02 and $0.05 loss per basic share) during the same periods of 2015. The difference between
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is mainly due to the significant increase in the derivative liability
related to the Company s warrants and increase in interest expense. The Company also recorded revenue of $13,450,545 and
$16,914,638 during the three and nine months ended September 2016 respectively. 

* Attributable to the Company. 

Summary of Quarterly Results   

Results for the eight most recent quarters
are set out in the table below and can be found in the respective interim reports: 

* Net income (loss) for the period attributable
to the Company 

Although the Company generated revenues
in the second and third quarter respectively, for the quarters illustrated in the above table, the main reasons for the significant
fluctuations in net income (loss) between periods are the fluctuations in the Company s derivative liabilities from warrants,
interest expense and the costs related to the Joint Venture Transaction.     The
Company s derivative liabilities are a function of the Company s stock price as compared to the instruments 
strike price and the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar. As the stock price rises, the derivative liabilities
increase resulting in the Company recognizing losses. When the stock price decreases, the Company recognizes gains.      

For fiscal 2015, the Company experienced
a loss related to its derivative liabilities in the amount of $101,749 (2014   Loss of $5,747,376) in the first quarter
whereas it recorded a gain of $2,568,849 (2014   Gain of $1,634,681) during the second quarter. The second quarter gain
was however off-set by higher interest expense and a one-time financing fee of $1,500,000 paid in connection with the June 2015
Loan. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a loss of $598,770 (2014   Gain of $2,861,314) related to the
derivative liabilities. Adding to the losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were the interest expense and amortization
of the discount on the June 2015 Loan and the convertible debenture and the interest expense related to the Komatsu loans. In
the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a gain of $1,465,895 (2014   Gain of $2,255,598) related to the derivative
liabilities. This gain was partially off-set by interest expense and amortization of the discount on the June 2015 Loan and the
interest expense related to the Komatsu loans. 

In general, the results of operations
can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the nature, timing and cost of activities undertaken during the quarter, whether
or not the Company incurs gains or losses on foreign exchange or grants stock options, and the movements in its derivative liability. 

Please refer to the   Results of Operations
  section above for the results of operations for the three and nine months ended on September 30, 2016. 

Reclamation Financial Assurance
and Asset Retirement Obligation   

Reclamation Financial Assurance 

The Company is required to provide the
Bureau of Land Management, the State Office of Mine Reclamation and Kern County with a revised reclamation cost estimate annually. 
The financial assurance is adjusted once the cost estimate is approved.  The Company s provision for reclamation of
the property is estimated each year by an independent consulting engineer. This estimate, once approved by state and county authorities,
forms the basis for the reclamation financial assurance. The reclamation assurance provided as at September 30, 2016 was $1,460,592
(December 31, 2015 - $624,142). 

The Company is also required to provide
financial assurance with the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (the  Regional Board ) for closure and
reclamation costs related to the lined impoundments, which are defined as the Stage 1 heap leach pad, the overflow pond, and the
solution collection channel. The reclamation financial assurance estimate for as of September 30, 2016 is $1,210,889 (December
31, 2015 - $Nil).  

In addition to the above, the Company
is required to obtain and maintain financial assurance for initiating and completing corrective action and remediation of a reasonably
foreseeable release from the Project s waste management units as required by the Regional Board.  The reclamation financial
assurance estimate for as of September 30, 2016 is $278,240 (December 31, 2015 - $278,240).  

The Company entered into $3.0 million
in surety bond agreements in order to release its reclamation deposits and post a portion of the financial assurance due in 2016.
The Company pays a yearly premium. Golden Queen Ltd. has provided a corporate guarantee on the surety bonds. 

Asset Retirement Obligation 

The total asset retirement obligation
as of September 30, 2016 is $1,268,541 (December 31, 2015 - $978,453).  

The Company estimated its asset retirement
obligations based on its understanding of the requirements to reclaim and clean-up its property based on its activities to date. 
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was an increase of $96,696 and $290,088 (Three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $278,240) to the asset retirement obligations. Of these totals, $74,167 and $245,030 was capitalized
to property, plant, equipment and mineral interests as the asset portion of the asset retirement obligation for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $71,892).  The remaining
amount of $22,529 and $45,058, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was expensed to operations as accretion
expense (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $Nil and $Nil). 

The Company estimates that the cash outflows
related to these reclamation activities will be incurred primarily in 2028.   Reclamation provisions are measured at
the expected value of future cash flows discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk-free interest rate and
adjusted for inflation. The Company used a credit adjusted risk-free rate of 9.20% (December 31, 2015   9.20%) and an inflation
rate of 2.27% (December 31, 2015   2.27%). 

Property Rent Payments and Production
Royalties   

The Company has acquired a number of mineral
properties outright. It has acquired exclusive rights to explore, develop and mine other portions of the Project under various
mining lease agreements with landowners.  

The Company is required to make property
rent payments related to its mining lease agreements with landholders, in the form of advance minimum royalties.  The total
property rent payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $Nil and $18,206 (three months ended September
30, 2015   $8,539 and nine months ended September 30, 3015 - $68,706), and the Company expects to pay approximately $30,000
in property rent payments in 2016. 

Production royalty payments commenced
during the first quarter of 2016. The Company has paid $345,184 and $406,147 in production royalties during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

There are multiple third party landholders
and the royalty amount due to each landholder over the life of the Project varies with each property.  

Contractual Obligations    

GQM LLC s contractual obligations as of September 30,
2016 are shown in the table below: 

GQM LTD s contractual obligations as of September 30,
2016 are shown in the table below: 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Stock Option Plan   

The Company s current stock option
plan (the  Plan ) was adopted by the Company in 2013 and approved by shareholders of the Company in 2013. The Company
also adopted a house keeping amendment to the plan on April 27, 2015 to clarify the procedure for fixing the early termination
date of stock options. The Plan provides a fixed number of 7,200,000 common shares of the Company that may be issued pursuant
to the grant of stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Company s
board of directors (the  Board ), but shall not be less than the volume-weighted, average trading price of the Company s
shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the  TSX ) for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the grant.
The expiry date of a stock option shall be the date so fixed by the Board subject to a maximum term of five years. The Plan provides
that the expiry date of the vested portion of a stock option will be the earlier of the date so fixed by the Board at the time
the stock option is awarded and the early termination date (the  Early Termination Date ). The Early Termination Date
will be the date the vested portion of a stock option expires following the option holder ceasing to be a director, employee or
consultant, as determined by the Board at the time of grant, or in the absence thereof at any time prior to the time the option
holder ceases to be a director, employee or consultant, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Plan. All options
granted under the 2013 Plan will be subject to such vesting requirements as may be prescribed by the TSX, if applicable, or as
may be imposed by the Board. 

A total of 1,070,000 (1,023,334 exercisable)
(December 31, 2015   1,070,000 (976,667 exercisable); September 30, 2015   1,270,000 (1,176,666 exercisable)) common
shares were issuable pursuant to such stock options as at September 30, 2016. 

Transactions with Related Parties   

Except as noted elsewhere in this Form
10-Q, related party transactions are disclosed as follows: 

(i)    Consulting Fees    

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid $Nil and $201,312 to Mr. H. Lutz Klingmann for services as President of the Company.
Included in these consulting fees was $151,428 related to 150,000 bonus shares (Refer to Note 4   Share Capital of the unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements). There were no consulting fees paid during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid a total of $27,447 and $83,685 (Three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $44,732
and $81,584) to the three independent directors of the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Thomas
M. Clay did not receive director fees. 

(ii)    Notes Payable    

On January 1, 2014, the Company
entered into an agreement to secure a $10,000,000 loan (the  January 2014 Loan ). The January 2014 Loan was provided
by members of the Clay family, who are shareholders of the Company, including $7,500,000 provided by an investment vehicle managed
by Thomas M. Clay, a Director and insider of the Company. The January 2014 Loan had a twelve-month term and an annual interest
rate of 5%, payable on the maturity date. 

The January 2014 Loan was repaid
on a date that is less than 183 days before the maturity date. As a result, the Company paid the Lenders an additional charge
in the amount that is equivalent to 5% of the principal amount, plus interest on the principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum
accrued to the date the January 2014 Loan was repaid. The Company repaid $7,500,000 loan plus the $375,000 accrued interest and
$375,000 additional charge on December 31, 2014. 

The remaining balance of the
loan, $2,500,000, the accrued interest of $125,000 and the additional charge of $125,000, were paid on January 5, 2015. 

On December 31, 2014 the Company
also entered into a new loan (the  December 2014 Loan ) with the same parties for an amount of $12,500,000. The December
2014 Loan was due on demand on July 1, 2015 and bore an annual interest rate of 10% payable at the end of each quarter. The loan
was guaranteed by GQM Holdings, and secured by a pledge of the Company's interests in GQM Canada, GQM Canada s interest
in GQM Holdings and GQM Holdings' 50% interest in GQM LLC. 

The Company also incurred a
financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,000,000, of which $750,000 was paid on December 31, 2014 and the remaining
$250,000 was paid on January 5, 2015.  The Company agreed
to pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument which amounted to $90,916. The total legal fees paid
for the transaction were $118,695.  

On June 8, 2015, the Company
amended the December 2014 Loan to extend the maturity to December 8, 2016 and increased the principal amount from $12,500,000
to $37,500,000 (the  June 2015 Loan ). The Company also issued 10,000,000 common share purchase warrants exercisable
for a period of five years expiring June 8, 2020. The common share purchase warrants have an exercise price of $0.95. All other
terms remained the same as the December 2014 Loan. The Company also incurred a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount
of $1,500,000, all of which was paid on June 8, 2015. The Company agreed to pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating
to this instrument which amounted to $46,408. The legal fees were expensed as the transaction met the definition of a debt extinguishment.
The terms of the registration rights remains unchanged as does the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the registration
rights being exercised. 

Interest payable relating to
the June 2015 Loan as at September 30, 2016 was $1,050,023 (December 31, 2015 - $969,645). Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the
$1,050,023 interest payable was paid in cash. Please refer to Note 15 of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for complete details. 

(iii)    Share Purchase Warrants    

On June 8, 2015 the Company
issued 10,000,000 share purchase warrants to the Clay family in connection with the June 2015 Loan. The share purchase warrants
are exercisable until June 8, 2020 at an exercise price of $0.95. Included in the June 2015 Loan agreement was an anti-dilution
provision. If the Company were to complete a financing at a share price lower than the exercise price of the share purchase warrants,
the exercise price of the share purchase warrants would be adjusted to match the price at which the financing was completed. 

The share purchase warrants
meet the definition of a derivative liability instrument as the exercise price is not a fixed price as described above. Therefore,
the settlement feature does not meet the  fixed-for-fixed  criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15. 

The fair value of the derivative
liability related to the share purchase warrants as at September 30, 2016 is $4,870,193 (December 31, 2015 - $2,498,269). The
derivative liability was calculated using an option pricing valuation model with the following assumptions: 

The estimated
fair value of the share purchase warrants is as follows: 

(iv)    Amortization of Discounts
                                         and Interest Expense    

The following table summarizes
the amortization of discounts and interest on loans and convertible debentures: 

The Company s loans were
contracted to fund significant development costs. The Company capitalizes a portion of the interest expense as it related to funds
borrowed to complete development activities at the Project site. 

*Komatsu is not a related party
and has only been included in the above table to reconcile the total interest expense incurred for the period to the amounts capitalized
and expensed. 

 **Interest capitalization ended
on March 31, 2016 as the mine went into production on April 1, 2016. 

(v)    Joint Venture Transaction    

Variable Interest Entity  

In accordance with ASC 810-10-30,
the Company has determined that GQM LLC meets the definition of a VIE and that the Company is part of a related party group that,
in its entirety, would meet the definition of a primary beneficiary.   Although no individual variable interest holder
individually meets the definition of a primary beneficiary in the absence of the related party group, Golden Queen has determined
it is considered the member of the related party group most closely associated with GQM LLC.  As a result, the Company has
consolidated 100% of the accounts of GQM LLC in these consolidated financial statements, while presenting a non-controlling interest
portion representing the 50% interest of Gauss in GQM LLC on its balance sheet.  A portion of the non-controlling interest
has been presented as temporary equity on the Company s balance sheet representing the initial value of the non-controlling
interest that could potentially be redeemable by Gauss in the future. 

The net assets of GQM LLC as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Included in the assets above,
is $15,414,250 (December 31, 2015 - $31,530,900) in cash held as at September 30, 2016. The cash in GQM LLC is directed specifically
to fund working capital until the Project reaches positive cash flows. The liabilities of GQM LLC do not have recourse to the
general credit of the primary beneficiary except in two situations. Please refer to notes 5 and 13 of the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements for details on the exceptions. 

Non-Controlling Interest

The carrying value of the non-controlling interest is adjusted for net income and loss, distributions and contributions pursuant
to ASC 810-10 based on the same percentage allocation used to calculate the initial book value of temporary equity. 

Operating performance   

Metal revenues*  

* Figures are shown on a 100% basis 

The Company recorded revenue for the first
time during the second quarter of 2016. For the third quarter GQM LLC sold 8,715 gold ounces at an average realized gold price
of $1,329 per ounce and 97,430 silver ounces at an average realized silver price of $19.22 per ounce. 

Operating Metrics  

Mining  

808K tons of ore were mined during the third
quarter with a strip ratio of 2.2:1 waste to ore. A total of 1,759K tons of ore has now been mined since January 2016 with a strip
ratio of 2.2:1 waste to ore. The lower stripping ratio, compared to the mine plan is due to more ore encountered on most benches
mined during the third quarter in the Northwest Pit and in the Main Pit, Phase-1. This has resulted in more ore and less waste
available for mining. Seven-day per week operations started in the Mining function in June. 

Northwest Pit: Mining
of the Northwest Pit commenced in 2015 and will continue into late 2017.  

Main Pit: Mining of the
Main Pit, Phase 1, commenced in early January of this year.  Mining of the Main pit, Phase-1, will continue throughout 2017. 

Reconciliation of the
three most recently mined benches in the Northwest Pit showed 35% more ore and 42% more Au than expected at 4% higher grade than
predicted by the mine plan (based on the block model). In the Main Pit, Phase 1, the five most recently mined benches showed 14%
more ore and 8% more Au at 5% lower grade. The foregoing ore quantities and grades are based on the results of mining activity
to date, and may not necessarily be indicative of future results. 

East Pit: The development
of the East Pit access road is completed. Bench mining started in the East Pit in June for waste and overburden. An in-fill drilling
program of the East Pit, for optimization of resources and mine planning, was completed in September. The results of the program
are not available at this time but the presence of the geologic structures was confirmed. The access road from the Primary Crusher
to the East Pit was completed in the third quarter and ore mining is expected begin in 2017 with substantial ore delivery in the
4 th  quarter of 2017. 

Processing and Production  

The Company has made
steady progress with the production rate of the crushing-screening plant and the pad-loading systems. HPGR performance continues
to exceed expectations. The hourly throughput of the plant, when operating, was above the design rate by 2% in the third quarter.
Run-time was below expectations but continues to improve. It was hampered by higher than expected wear on some components. Total
pad-loading production was 763K tons in the third quarter or 18% higher than the second quarter. The daily average throughput
for placing ore on the pad was 8,479 tons per scheduled operating day for the quarter. Seven-day per week operations started in
the Process function in June. 

At the end of
September, 1,770,922 tons, loaded during 2016, were under leach on the heap-leach pad. In the third quarter, agglomerate
quality and the porosity and permeability of the heap-leach pad continued to be good. 

The average grade of ore processed during
Q3 2016 was 0.016 oz/t Au and 0.362 oz/t Ag. A total of 11,928 gold ounces and 276,043 silver ounces were placed on the heap leach
pad during the third quarter. 

Au production commenced in April 2016.
GQM LLC produced 7,975 gold ounces and 87,849 silver ounces during third quarter of 2016. 

Cost of sales  

The Project is still in the ramp-up phase
and it is anticipated that operating costs will decrease as the average throughput increases. 

Mining costs averaged $1.53 per ton mined
during the third quarter of 2016. Mining unit costs were somewhat higher than anticipated due to the lower than anticipated tonnage
moved during the quarter. However, total mining costs were 26% lower than expected. Equipment availability remained high. 

Processing costs averaged $5.48 per ton
processed during the third quarter of 2016. Processing unit costs were higher than anticipated due to the lower than anticipated
tonnage loaded on the pad. Higher total costs were also due to greater than anticipated wear in some parts of the process plant.
This excessive wear due to the ore abrasiveness is being addressed by a retro-fit program in the plant including crusher liner
improvements. 

Site support, maintenance and site G A
averaged $2.47 per ton processed during the third quarter of 2016. Site support and Administrative unit costs were higher than
expected due to the lower than anticipated pad-loading production and also for dust control initiatives and unanticipated insurance
and legal costs. Maintenance costs were higher in the processing plant due to higher wear and start-up. 

Total site operating costs averaged $13.13
per ton processed during the third quarter of 2016. Cash costs per ounces of gold sold were $854/oz net of silver by-product.
The Project is still in the ramp-up phase, and cash costs are expected to decrease as gold production increases. Please refer
to   Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures   section below for further details. 

Select Non-Consolidated Figures   

The Company has 50% interest in GQM LLC,
which, meets the definition of a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ). The Company consolidates entities which meet the
definition of a VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary. The Company, has determined it is the member of the related party
group that is most closely associated with GQM LLC and, as a result, is the primary beneficiary who consolidates GQM LLC. 

The following table shows figures attributable to the Company
only as of September 30, 2016 

* Includes GQM Holdings 

Figures shown for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The Company has generated
$16,914,638 revenues from operations since inception and as at September 30, 2016 had an accumulated deficit of $88,202,370 and
a working capital deficit of $17,428,374. Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,105,079. 

As at September 30, 2016, Golden Queen,
on a non-consolidated basis, currently does not have sufficient funds to repay the $37,500,000 loan plus the accrued interest.
However, in order to secure the necessary funds to meet this upcoming obligation and mitigate the going concern issue, management
is actively exploring several options including debt financing and equity issuance. 

In July 2016, the Company completed an
equity financing and raised gross proceeds of C$16.1 million. The net proceeds of C$15.0 million will be used to repay a portion
of the loan on December 8, 2016.     

While Golden Queen has been successful
at certain of these efforts in the past, there can be no assurance that future efforts will be successful. This raises substantial
doubt about this entity s ability to continue as a going concern. 

At the Project level, GQM LLC has sufficient
funds to meet its contractual obligations for the next 12 months. 

The Company s access to the net
assets of GQM LLC is determined by the Board of Managers of GQM LLC. The Board of Managers is not controlled by the Company and
therefore there is no guarantee that any access to the net assets of GQM LLC would be provided to the Company in order to continue
as a going concern. The Board of Managers of GQM LLC determine when and if distributions from GQM LLC are made to the holders
of its membership units at their sole discretion. 

These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be
material. 

The Company s 50%-owned subsidiary,
GQM LLC, which holds the Company s interest in the Soledad Mountain project, held $15,414,250 in cash as of September 30,
2016 as compared to $45,643,060 on September 30, 2015. It is expected that the current cash on hand will fund remaining working
capital needs until in the end of the year 2016 when the Project is expected to reach positive cash flow.     

Cash used in Operating Activities : 

Cash used to fund operating
activities, was $3,105,079 (nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $4,815,347) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
The decrease in cash used in operating activities is mostly due to the increase in revenues since the Company started
production in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, during this quarter the Company invested $6,116,952 building-up ore
on leach pad inventory ($182,865 third quarter 2015). 

Cash used in Investing Activities:  

Cash used in investing activities totaled
$10,498,491 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (nine months ended September 30, 2015 - $60,161,928). The decrease
is due to the decreased level of construction activity on site as the Project construction was finalized. 

Cash from Financing Activities:  

Cash provided by financing
activities totaled $7,171,678 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (nine months ended September 30, 2015  
cash provided by financing activities $25,575,000) and relates to the July equity financing and repayments of loans payable
at the project level. The January 1, April 1, and July 1, 2016 interest payments due on the June 2015 Loan of $2,977,028 have
been added to the principal balance. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
was the result of the June 2015 Loan and our JV partner s Top-Up contribution. 

Working Capital:  

As at September 30, 2016, the Company,
on a consolidated basis, had current assets of $41,152,913 (December 31, 2015 - $39,979,225) and current liabilities of $58,581,288
(December 31, 2015 - $47,722,334) or working capital deficit of $17,428,374 (December 31, 2015   working capital deficit
of $7,743,109). The increase     in current
assets from December 31, 2015 is mostly the result of construction and working capital expenditures on site. The increase in current
liabilities is mainly due to the increase in the derivative liability. 

GQM LLC will use its cash on hand for
working capital related expenditures until in the end of the year 2016 when the Project is expected to be generating positive
cash flows.     

The Company will use its cash for general
corporate expenditures such as accounting fees, legal fees, interest expense and corporate salary expenses.

Outlook   

The Company is evaluating its options,
including debt financing and equity issuance, to refinance the June 2015 Loan which matures on December 8, 2016. The Company has
raised gross proceeds of C$16.1 million in July to repay a portion of the loan. 

The ability of the Company to operate
a mine on the property is subject to numerous risks, certain of which are disclosed in the Company s latest Form 10-K filing
with the SEC, dated March 30, 2016. Readers should evaluate the Company s prospects in light of these and other risk factors. 

Subsequent Events   

On October 1st, 2016, the Company made an interest payment
of $1,050,023 in accordance with the terms of the June 2015 Loan agreement. 

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures   

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended
to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles.
These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Total Cash Costs  

Total cash costs are common financial
performance measures in the gold mining industry but with no standard meaning under US GAAP. Management believes that, in addition
to conventional measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance
and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The measure, along with sales,
is considered to be a key indicator of a Company s ability to generate earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. 

Total cash cost figures are calculated
in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold
products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is
the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost
measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate
these measures differently. Total cash costs are derived from amounts included in the statement of operations and include direct
mining costs and site general and administrative costs. The direct mining costs shown on the table below include mine site operating
costs such as mining, processing, smelting, refining, third party transportation costs, advanced minimum royalties and production
costs less silver metals revenues. Management has determined that silver metals revenues when compared with gold metals revenues,
are immaterial and therefore are considered a by-product of the production of gold. The table below shows a reconciliation of
total cash costs per gold ounce and cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis: 

All-in Sustaining Costs  

In September 2013, the World Gold Council,
a non-regulatory association of the world s leading gold mining companies established to promote the use of gold to industry,
consumers and investors, provided guidance for the calculation of the measure  All-in sustaining costs , which has
no standard meaning under US GAAP. These standards became effective January 1, 2014. Management believes that the all-in sustaining
costs measure provides additional insight into the costs of producing gold by capturing all of the expenditures required for the
discovery, development and sustaining of gold production and allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures
to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. Management believes that, in addition to conventional
measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to
generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. 

Golden Queen defines all-in sustaining
costs as the sum of direct mining costs (as defined under total cash costs), site and corporate general and administrative costs,
share based payments, reclamation liability accretion and capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature. Adoption of the
standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Other companies may calculate these measures differently. 

The table below shows a reconciliation
of all-in sustaining costs per ounce to the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements: 

General
and administrative expenses in Income Statement include a foreign exchange gain of $273,470 for the three months ended September
30, 2016.  

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Estimates   

Revenue
is recognized when title to gold and silver passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title passes to
the buyer based on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference
to active and freely traded commodity markets, for example, the London Bullion Market for both gold and silver, in an identical
form to the product sold.  

Besides
of the revenue recognition policy mentioned above, full disclosure of the Company s significant accounting policies and
estimates in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Stated can be found in notes of its audited
consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2015.   

Recent Accounting Standards   

(i)  Effective August 2014, FASB issued
                                         Accounting Standards update ( ASU ) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements
                                           Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
                                         Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The update essentially requires management of
                                         all entities, for annual and interim periods, to evaluate whether there are conditions
                                         or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
                                         ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements
                                         are issued.   

If conditions or events raise
substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a
result of consideration of management s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial
statements to understand all of the following: 

1.  Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt
                                         about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern (before consideration
                                         of management s plans).   

2.  Management s evaluation of the significance of those
                                         conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations.   

3.  Management s plans that alleviated substantial doubt
                                         about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   

If conditions or events raise
substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is not alleviated after
consideration of management s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is  substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern  within one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued (or available to be issued). 

This update will come into
effect for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company
is assessing the impact of this standard.

                                          which focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations (public
                                         and private companies and not-for-profit organizations) that are required to evaluate
                                         whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number
                                         of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the standards and
                                         improves current GAAP by:   

Placing
                                         more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting
                                         organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances
                                         based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain criteria are met.   

Reducing
                                         the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling
                                         financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE).   

Changing
                                         consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that
                                         typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs.   

The ASU will be effective for
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, for public companies. The Company have adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016 and
it had no impact on the Company s results or financial position. 

(iii)  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU
                                         2016-01, Financial Instruments   Recognition and measurement of financial assets
                                         and financial liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) which updates several aspects of recognition,
                                         measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments that
                                         are relevant to the Company are as follows:   

1.  Eliminate the requirement for
                                         public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
                                         estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured
                                         at amortized cost on the balance sheet.   

2.  Require public business entities
                                         to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
                                         disclosure purposes.   

3.  Require separate presentation
                                         of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
                                         asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying
                                         notes to the financial statements.   

The ASU will be effective for
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard. 

(iv)  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
                                         Compensation   Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) which updates several aspects
                                         of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
                                         classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
                                         of cash flows.   

The ASU will be effective for periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, for public companies. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard. 

In August 2015, the effective
date was deferred to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 31, 2017, and will be applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the consolidated
financial statements and disclosures. 

(vi)  In February 2016, FASB issued ASC
                                         842 that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities
                                         on the balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The update, which
                                         supersedes existing lease guidance, will continue to classify leases as either finance
                                         or operating, with the classification determining the pattern of expense recognition
                                         in the income statement.   

The ASU will be effective for
annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is applicable on a modified retrospective
basis with various optional practical expedients. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard. 

Qualified Person and Caution With Respect to Forward-looking
Statements    

Mr. Timothy Mazanek, PE, and Mr.
Peter Herrera, PG are all qualified persons for the purpose of NI 43-101 and have reviewed and approved the
technical information in this Form 10Q. 

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking
statements, which relate to the intent, belief and current expectations of the Company s management, as well as assumptions
and parameters used in the Soledad Mountain Project Technical Report and Updated Feasibility Study, February 25, 2015. These forward-looking
statements are based upon numerous assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results
to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include among other things the receipt
and compliance with the terms of required approvals and permits, the costs of and availability of sufficient capital to fund the
projects to be undertaken by the Company and commodity prices. In addition, projected mining results, including quantity of ore,
grade, production rates, and recovery rates, are subject to numerous risks normally associated with mining activity of the nature
described in this report and in the feasibility study, and as a result actual results may differ substantially from projected
results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
the statements were made.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  

Credit Risk  

Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty
to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Company by failing to discharge its obligations. To mitigate exposure
to credit risk on financial assets the Company has established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure counterparties
demonstrate minimum acceptable credit worthiness. 

The Company maintains its US Dollar and
Canadian Dollar cash in bank accounts with major financial institutions with high credit standings. Cash deposits held in the
United States are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 and Canadian Dollar cash deposits held in Canada are insured by the Canada
Deposit Insurance Corporation ( CDIC ) for up to C$100,000. 

Certain United States and Canadian bank
accounts held by the Company exceed these federally insured limits or are uninsured as they relate to US Dollar deposits held
in Canadian financial institutions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s cash balances held in
United States and Canadian financial institutions include $31,155,419 and $37,587,311 respectively, which are not fully insured
by the FDIC or CDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes that using major financial
institutions with high credit ratings mitigates the credit risk in cash. 

Interest Rate Risk  

The interest rates received on these balances
may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash balances during the three months ending September
30, 2016, a 1% decrease in interest rates would have reduced the interest income to a trivial amount. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  

Certain labour costs are denominated in
Canadian dollars. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations. Specifically, the appreciation
of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar may result in an increase in the Canadian operating expenses in U.S. dollar terms.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained the majority of its cash balance in U.S. dollars. 

Commodity Price Risk  

The Company s primary business activity
is the development of the open pit, gold and silver, heap leach project on the Property. Decreases in the price of either of these
metals from current levels has the potential to negatively impact the future viability of the Project. The Company holds a small
portfolio of derivative contracts in the form of gold zero-cost collars in order to hedge against the gold spot price volatility
risk. A 10% change in the gold spot price would have a trivial impact on the change in the fair value of the derivative contracts
held by the Company. The Company may enter into hedging contracts from time to time to protect the cash flows from commodity price
volatility. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The term  disclosure controls and
procedures  is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. These rules refer to the controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It is management s
responsibility to establish and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, and our external Sarbanes-Oxley consultants carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively. 

Changes in Internal Control  

Since the Company started production during
the second quarter of 2016 new processes and internal controls over such areas as revenue recognition, cost accounting and inventory
valuation have been implemented. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     

Fraud Analysis  

The Company is committed to preventing
fraud and corruption and is developing an anti-fraud culture. To achieve this goal, the Company has committed to the following: 

1.  Developing and maintaining effective
                                         controls to prevent fraud;   

2.  Ensuring that if fraud occurs
                                         a vigorous and prompt investigation takes place;   

3.  Taking appropriate disciplinary
                                         and legal actions;   

4.  Reviewing systems and procedures
                                         to prevent similar frauds;   

5.  Investigating whether there has
                                         been a failure in supervision and take appropriate disciplinary action if supervisory
                                         failures occurred; and   

6.  Recording and reporting all discovered
                                         cases fraud.   

The following policies have been developed

1.    Citations
and Orders are issued under Section 104 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 814) (the  Act )
for violations of the Act or any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order or regulation promulgated under the Act. A Section
104(a)  Significant and Substantial  or  S S  citation is considered more severe than a non-S S
citation and generally is issued in a situation where the conditions created by the violation do not cause imminent danger, but
the violation is of such a nature as could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety
or health hazard. It should be noted that, for purposes of this table, S S citations that are included in another column,
such as Section 104(d) citations, are not also included as Section 104(a) S S citations in this column.  

2.    A
Section 104(b) withdrawal order is issued if, upon a follow up inspection, an MSHA inspector finds that a violation has not been
abated within the period of time as originally fixed in the violation and determines that the period of time for the abatement
should not be extended. Under a withdrawal order, all persons, other than those required to abate the violation and certain others,
are required to be withdrawn from and prohibited from entering the affected area of the mine until the inspector determines that
the violation has been abated.  

3.    A
citation is issued under Section 104(d) where there is an S S violation and the inspector finds the violation to be caused
by an unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply with a mandatory health or safety standard. Unwarrantable failure is a special
negligence finding that is made by an MSHA inspector and that focuses on the operator s conduct. If during the same inspection
or any subsequent inspection of the mine within 90 days after issuance of the citation, the MSHA inspector finds another violation
caused by an unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply, a withdrawal order is issued, under which all persons, other than
those required to abate the violation and certain others, are required to be withdrawn from and prohibited from entering the affected
area until the inspector determines that the violation has been abated.  

4.    A
flagrant violation under Section 110(b)(2) is a violation that results from a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable
efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or
reasonable could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.  

5.    An
imminent danger order under Section 107(a) is issued when an MSHA inspector finds that an imminent danger exists in a mine. An
imminent danger is the existence of any condition or practice which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical
harm before such condition or practice can be abated. Under an imminent danger order, all persons, other than those required to
abate the condition or practice and certain others, are required to be withdrawn from and are prohibited from entering the affected
area until the inspector determines that such imminent danger and the conditions or practices which caused the imminent danger
no longer exist.  

6.    These
dollar amounts include the total amount of all proposed assessments from MSHA under the Act relating to any type of violation
during the period, including proposed assessments for non-S S citations that are not specifically identified in this exhibit,
regardless of whether the Company has challenged or appealed the assessment.  

7.    A
Notice is given under Section 104(e) if an operator has a pattern of S S violations. If upon any inspection of the mine within
90 days after issuance of the notice, or at any time after a withdrawal notice has been given under Section 104(e), an MSHA inspector
finds another S S violation, an order is issued, under which all persons, other than those required to abate the violation
and certain others, are required to be withdrawn from and prohibited from entering the affected area until the inspector determines
that the violation has been abated.  

8.    There
were no legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as of the last day of the period covered
by this report. In addition, there were no pending actions that are (a) contests of citations and orders referenced in Subpart
B of 29 CFR Part 2700; (b) complaints for compensation referenced in subpart D of 29 CFR Part 2700; (c) complaints of discharge,
discrimination or interference referenced in Subpart E of 29 CFR Part 2700; (d) applications for temporary relief referenced in
Subpart F of 29 CFR Part 2700; or (e) appeals of judges  decisions or orders to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review
Commission referenced in Subpart H of 29 CFR Part 2700.
