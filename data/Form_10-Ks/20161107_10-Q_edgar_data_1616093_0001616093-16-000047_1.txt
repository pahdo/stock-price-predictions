PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  On August 26, 2016, Wells Fargo Real Estate Investment Corporation (the Company) issued and sold   21.2 million   shares of the Company s common stock to affiliates of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of   $20.0 billion  . Subsequent to the issuance, the Company used the proceeds, as well as proceeds from loan pay-downs and payoffs, to acquire   $19.1 billion   of real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and   $1.9 billion   of commercial secured by real estate loans (CSRE). 
  FINANCIAL REVIEW 

(1) 
    Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of earnings per common share. 
              (2) 
    The     dividend coverage ratio is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes the dividend coverage ratio is a useful financial measure because the certificate of designation for the Series A preferred stock limits, among other matters, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make any payment of interest or principal on our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, if the dividend coverage ratio for the four prior fiscal quarters is less than 150%. The dividend coverage ratio is expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing the four prior fiscal quarters' GAAP net income, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property (consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition of  funds from operations ), by the amount that would be required to pay annual dividends on the Series A and Series B preferred stock. 
              (3) 
    The carrying value of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans contractually 90 days or more past due is excluded. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms.

This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forecasts and expectations due to several factors. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are described in this Report, including in the  Forward-Looking Statements  section, and the  Risk Factors  section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (2015 Form 10-K). 
    
  When we refer to  WFREIC,  the  Company,   we,   our,  and  us  in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo Real Estate Investment Corporation, and where relevant, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, acting on our behalf; the  Bank  refers to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association; and  Wells Fargo  refers to Wells Fargo   Company. 
    
  Financial Review 
               OVERVIEW 

The Company is engaged in acquiring, holding and managing predominantly domestic mortgage assets and other authorized investments that generate net income for distribution to our shareholders. We are classified as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes and are an indirect subsidiary of Wells Fargo and the Bank.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $33.8 billion   in assets, consisting substantially of real estate loan participation interests (loans). Our interests in mortgage and other assets have been acquired from the Bank pursuant to loan participation and servicing and assignment agreements among the Bank, certain of its subsidiaries and us. The Bank originated the loans, purchased them from other financial institutions or acquired them as part of the acquisition of other financial institutions. Substantially all of our loans are serviced by the Bank.  
  REIT Tax Status 
  For the tax year ended   December 31, 2015  , we complied with the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) to be taxed as a REIT. These provisions for qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes are complex, involving many requirements, including among others, distributing at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to shareholders and satisfying certain asset, income and stock ownership tests. To the extent we meet those provisions, we will not be subject to federal income tax on net income. We continue to monitor each of these complex tests. We believe that we continue to satisfy each of these requirements and therefore continue to qualify as a REIT. 
  In the event we do not continue to qualify as a REIT, earnings and cash provided by operating activities available for distribution to shareholders would be reduced by the amount of any applicable income tax obligation. Given the level of earning assets, we currently expect there would be sufficient earnings and ample cash to pay preferred dividends. The preferred and common dividends we pay as a REIT are ordinary investment income not eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders or for the favorable qualified dividend tax rate applicable to non-corporate taxpayers. If we were not a REIT, preferred and common dividends we pay generally would qualify for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and the favorable qualified dividend tax rate applicable to non-corporate taxpayers.  

Common Stock Issuance 
  On August 26, 2016, the Company issued and sold   21.2 million   shares of the Company s common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of   $20.0 billion  . The shares were sold to affiliates of the Company. Following the issuance, indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. continue to own 100% of the Company s common stock. 
  We used proceeds from the common stock issuance, as well as proceeds from loan pay-downs and payoffs, to acquire $19.1 billion of real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and $1.9 billion of CSRE loans in third quarter 2016 (Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions). The weighted average FICO score and LTV ratio for real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans included in the acquisition was 783 and 62%, respectively, compared with 762 and 57% as of September 30, 2016, for our existing portfolio. The percentage of acquired CSRE loan risk ratings, based on recorded investment, designated as Pass under the Bank's borrower and collateral quality ratings was 100%, compared with 99.6% as of September 30, 2016, for our existing CSRE portfolio. 
    
  Financial Performance 
  We earned net income of   $191.3 million   in   third   quarter   2016  , or  $8.82   diluted earnings per common share, compared with   $179.9 million   in   third   quarter   2015  , or   $13.61   diluted earnings per common share. The increase in net income in   third   quarter   2016   was predominantly attributable to increased interest income resulting from a larger average interest-earning asset base due to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. For the first nine months of   2016  , net income was   $485.0 million   or   $30.09   diluted earnings per common share, compared with   $487.5 million   or   $36.77   diluted earnings per common share for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net income in the first nine months of   2016   was predominantly attributable to a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by increased interest income resulting from a larger average interest-earning asset base due to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions. 
  Loans  
  Total loans were   $33.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $13.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Net loans represented   99%   of assets at both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Credit quality, as measured by net charge-off rates, nonaccruals and delinquencies, continued to improve during   third   quarter   2016   reflecting the benefit of continued  

3 

improvement in the housing environment and the acquisition of high quality loans in the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions. Net charge-offs were   $3.2 million   in   third   quarter   2016   (  0.06%   annualized as a percent of average loans), compared with   $8.9 million   in   third   quarter   2015   (  0.27%   annualized as a percent of average loans). Nonaccrual loans were   $228.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $268.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing were   $6.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $13.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Third   quarter   2016   provision for credit losses was   $18.7 million  , compared with a reversal of provision for credit losses of   $23.0 million   a year ago. We had an allowance build of   $15.5 million   in third quarter 2016 compared to a release from the allowance of   $31.9 million   in third quarter 2015. The higher level of provision in third quarter compared to a year ago reflected loan growth as well as moderation in the rate of delinquency improvement. Future allowance levels will be based on a variety of factors, including loan portfolio composition, size and performance, and the general economic environment, including housing market conditions. 

During the first week of October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused destruction along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina and resulted in, among other things, property damage for our customers and the closing of many businesses. We are currently assessing the impact to our customers and our business as a result of Hurricane Matthew. The financial impact to us is expected to relate to our consumer and commercial real estate loan portfolios and will depend on a number of factors, including the types of loans most affected by the hurricane, the extent of damage to our collateral, the extent of available insurance coverage, the availability of government assistance for our borrowers, and whether our borrowers  ability to repay their loans has been diminished. 
  Capital Distributions 
  Dividends declared to holders of our Series A preferred stock totaled   $4.3 million   and   $13.1 million   in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of both   2016   and   2015  . Dividends declared to holders of our Series B preferred stock totaled   $15 thousand   and   $43 thousand   in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of both   2016   and   2015  . 
  Dividends declared to the holders of our common stock totaled   $215.0 million   and   $495.0 million   for the third quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $145.0 million   and   $425.0 million   for the same periods in   2015  .

Earnings Performance  

Net Income  
  We earned net income of   $191.3 million   and   $179.9 million   in   third   quarter   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in net income in   third   quarter   2016   was predominantly attributable to increased interest income resulting from a larger average interest-earning asset base due to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. For the first nine months of   2016  , net income was   $485.0 million  , compared with   $487.5 million   for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net income in the first nine months of   2016   was predominantly attributable to a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by increased interest income resulting from a larger average interest-earning asset base due to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions. 
    
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and cash and cash equivalents less the interest paid on our Bank line of credit. Net interest income was   $223.4 million   in   third   quarter   2016  , compared with   $171.2 million   a year ago and   $552.3 million   for the first nine months of   2016  , compared with   $505.8 million   a year ago. The increase in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016   was attributable to a larger interest-earning asset base due to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions, offset by a decrease in yield. 
  Net interest margin is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average interest paid for funding. Interest-earning assets predominantly consist of loans. Net interest margin was   3.62%   and   4.34%   in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   5.23%   and   5.24%   for the same periods a year ago. The decrease in net interest margin for the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016   was attributable to the investment of proceeds from the common stock issuance in third quarter 2016 and proceeds from loan pay-downs and payoffs into lower yielding loans, as well as dilution from higher average interest-bearing deposits. Interest income in the   third   quarter   2016   and first nine months of   2016   included net accretion of adjustments on loans of   $4.7 million   and   $42.5 million  , respectively, compared with   $20.9 million   and   $62.9 million   a year ago. The decrease in net accretion of adjustments on loans in both periods is attributable to less remaining net unamortized discount on the loan portfolio in 2016. Loan pay-downs and payoffs annualized represented   25.1%   and   24.3%   of average loan balances during the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   23.7%   and   24.0%   during the same periods a year ago. 

We expect continued downward pressure on our average yield on total interest-earning assets as we invest available funds in the current low interest rate environment. The Company believes interest income will increase due to the larger interest-earning asset base as a result of the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions; however, interest income in any one period can be affected by a variety of factors, including mix and size of the earning asset portfolio. See the  Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management - Interest Rate Risk  section in this Report for more information on interest rates and interest income. 
  The Company has a   $2.2 billion   line of credit with the Bank. Interest expense related to borrowings on the line of credit was   $1.3 million   and   $2.0 million   in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , compared with   $377 thousand   and   $644 thousand   for the same periods a year ago. Average borrowings for   third   quarter   2016   and   2015   were   $952.8 million   and   $393.3 million  , respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of   0.53%   and   0.38%  , respectively. Average borrowings for the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , were   $523.9 million   and   $226.3 million  , respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of   0.52%   and   0.38%  , respectively. The increase in weighted average interest rate in the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016 was attributable to an increase in the average federal funds rate. 
  Table 1   presents the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and related average yields to provide an analysis of year-over-year changes that influenced net interest income.

Table 1:     Interest Income   

Provision for Credit Losses 
  Third   quarter   2016   provision for credit losses was   $18.7 million  , compared with a reversal of provision for credit losses of   $23.0 million   a year ago. We had an allowance build of   $15.5 million   in third quarter 2016 compared to a release from the allowance of   $31.9 million   in third quarter 2015. For the first nine months of   2016  , the provision for credit losses was   $30.2 million  , compared with a reversal of provision for credit losses of   $23.9 million   a year ago. The higher level of provision in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to a year ago reflected loan growth as well as moderation in the rate of delinquency improvement. See the  Balance Sheet Analysis  and "Risk Management-Allowance for Credit Losses  sections in this Report for additional information on the allowance for credit losses. 
    
  Noninterest Income 
  Noninterest income in   third   quarter   2016   was   $7.9 million  , compared with   $1.7 million   a year ago and   $15.9 million   and   $2.3 million   in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. In the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, noninterest income predominantly consisted of loan pledge fees.  
  We may pledge our loans in an aggregate amount not exceeding   80%   of our total assets at any time as collateral on behalf of the Bank for the Bank s access to secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home Loan Banks or the discount window of Federal Reserve Banks. In exchange for the pledge of our loan assets, the Bank will pay us a fee that is consistent with  

market terms. We earned   $8.7 million   and   $16.5 million   in pledge fees during the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared with   $1.5 million   and   $1.9 million   for the same periods a year ago. The increase in both periods was attributable to a higher average pledged loan balance as well as a higher pledge fee rate in the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016. See Note 5 (Transactions With Related Parties) to Financial Statements in this Report for more details. 
    
  Noninterest Expense 
  Noninterest expense in   third   quarter   2016   was   $21.3 million  , compared with   $16.0 million   a year ago and   $53.0 million   and   $44.4 million   in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Noninterest expense predominantly consists of loan servicing costs, management fees, and foreclosed assets expense. 
  The loans in our portfolio are predominantly serviced by the Bank pursuant to the terms of participation and servicing and assignment agreements. In limited instances, the Bank has delegated servicing responsibility to third parties that are not affiliated with us or the Bank. Depending on the loan type, the monthly servicing fee charges are based in part on (a) outstanding principal balances, (b) a flat fee per month, or (c) a total loan commitment amount. Loan servicing costs in   third   quarter   2016   were   $13.3 million  , compared with   $9.1 million   in   third   quarter   2015   and   $30.9 million   and   $26.6 million   in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in

both periods was attributable to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions. 
  Management fees represent reimbursements made to the Bank for general overhead expenses, including allocations of technology support and a combination of finance and accounting, risk management and other general overhead expenses incurred on our behalf. Management fees are calculated based on Wells Fargo s total allocable costs multiplied by a formula. The formula is based on our proportion of Wells Fargo s consolidated: (1) full-time equivalent employees, (2) total average assets and (3) total revenue. Management fees were   $4.4 million   and   $11.8 million   in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $2.9 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively, in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2015  . The increase in management fees in 2016 related to an increase in Wells Fargo s general overhead expenses, including technology and risk management expenses, as well as higher total average assets due to the common stock issuance in third quarter 2016.  
  Foreclosed assets expense was   $3.2 million   in   third   quarter   2016   compared with   $3.8 million   in   third   quarter   2015   and   $9.6 million   and   $8.7 million   in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in the first nine months of   2016   was due to higher costs of maintaining our foreclosed assets, including tax and insurance expenses. Substantially all of our foreclosed assets consist of residential 1-4 family real estate assets.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Total Assets 
  Our assets predominantly consist of commercial and consumer loans, although we have the authority to hold assets other than loans. Total assets were $  33.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and $  13.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase is attributable to the Third Quarter 2016 Loan Acquisitions through the use of proceeds from the common stock issuance. 
  Loans 
  Loans, net of unearned income were $  33.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and $  13.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . In the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, we acquired   $19.1 billion   and   $21.4 billion   of consumer loans, respectively, and   $1.9 billion   of commercial loans for both periods, from the Bank at their estimated fair value using proceeds from the common stock issuance and loan pay-downs and payoffs. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, we acquired   $794.5 million     and   $2.5 billion  , respectively, of consumer loans from the Bank at their estimated fair value. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , consumer loans represented   87%   and   78%   of loans, respectively, and commercial loans represented the balance of our loan portfolio. 
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses increased   $9.8 million   to $  130.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $120.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   due to commercial and consumer loan growth through acquisition, partially offset by continued improvement in the housing environment. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for loan losses included $  104.7 million   for consumer loans and $  26.0 million   for commercial loans; however, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. The total allowance reflects management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. See the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management   Allowance for Credit Losses  section in this Report for a description of how management estimates the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. 

Accounts Receivable Affiliates, Net 
  Accounts payable and receivable from affiliates result from intercompany transactions in the normal course of business related to loan pay-downs and payoffs, interest receipts, servicing costs, management fees and other transactions with the Bank or its affiliates. 
    
  Line of Credit with Bank 
  We draw upon our $  2.2 billion   line of credit to finance loan acquisitions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $1.4 billion   and $  828.1 million   outstanding, respectively. 
    
  Retained Earnings (Deficit) 
  We expect to distribute annually an aggregate amount of dividends with respect to outstanding capital stock equal to approximately 100% of our REIT taxable income for federal income tax purposes before dividends paid deduction. Because our net income determined under GAAP may vary from the determination of REIT taxable income, periodic distributions may exceed our GAAP net income. 
  The retained deficit included within our balance sheet results from cumulative distributions that have exceeded GAAP net income, predominantly due to the impact on REIT taxable income of purchase accounting adjustments attributable to the Company during the years 2009 through 2013, from the 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corporation by Wells Fargo. 
  For further information on the differences between taxable income before dividends paid deduction reported on our income tax returns and net income as reported in our statement of income, see the "Balance Sheet Analysis" section in our   2015   Form 10-K.

Risk Management 

Our board of directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the Company s risk management structure. This oversight is accomplished through the audit committee of the board of directors and a management-level committee that reviews the allowance for credit losses and is supplemented by certain elements of Wells Fargo s risk management framework. For more information about how we manage these risks, see the  Risk Management  section in our   2015   Form 10-K. The discussion that follows provides an update regarding these risks. 

Credit Risk Management   Loans represent the largest component of our assets and their related credit risk is among the most significant risks we manage. We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). 
  Table 2   represents loans by segment and class of financing receivable and the weighted average maturity for those loans calculated using contractual maturity dates. 

Table 2:     Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and Class of Financing Receivable and Weighted Average Contractual Maturity    

    The discussion that follows provides analysis of the risk elements of our various loan portfolios and our credit risk management and measurement practices. See Note 2 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information. 
  In order to maintain our REIT status, the composition of our loan portfolio is highly concentrated in real estate. 

We continually evaluate our credit policies and modify as necessary. Measuring and monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, collateral values, FICO scores, economic trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.

LOAN PORTFOLIO BY GEOGRAPHY    Table 3   is a summary of the geographical distribution of our loan portfolio for the top five states by loans outstanding. 

Table 3:     Loan Portfolio by Geography   

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS (C I)    C I loans were less than 1% of total loans at   September 30, 2016  . We believe the C I loan portfolio is appropriately underwritten. Our credit risk management process for this portfolio focuses on a customer's ability to repay the loan through their cash flows. Substantially all of the loans in our C I portfolio are unsecured  

at   September 30, 2016  , with the remainder secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a secondary source of repayment. 

10 

COMMERCIAL SECURED BY REAL ESTATE (CSRE)     The CSRE portfolio consists of both mortgage loans and construction loans, where loans are secured by real estate.   Table 4   summarizes CSRE loans by state and property type. To identify and manage newly emerging problem CSRE loans, we employ a high level of monitoring and regular customer interaction to understand and manage the risks associated with these loans,  

including regular loan reviews and appraisal updates. We consider the creditworthiness of the customers and collateral valuations when selecting CSRE loans for acquisition. In future periods, we expect to consider acquisitions of CSRE loans in addition to other REIT qualifying assets such as real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans.  

Table 4:     CSRE Loans by State and Property Type

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY MORTGAGE LOANS      The concentrations of real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans by state and the related combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio are presented in   Table 5  . CLTV means the ratio of the total loan balance of first and junior mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. Our underwriting and periodic review of loans secured by residential real estate collateral includes appraisals or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. We also monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Additional information about AVMs and our policy for their use can be found in Note 2 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the "Risk Management - Credit Risk  

Management - Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans" section in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. For more information on our participation in the U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs, see the "Risk Management - Credit Risk Management - Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans" section in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  The credit performance associated with our real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio continued to improve in   third   quarter   2016  , as measured through net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans. Improvement in the credit performance was driven by an improving housing environment. 

Table 5:     Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans CLTV by State    

           (1) 
    Collateral values are generally determined using AVMs and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas. 

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY FIRST MORTGAGE LOANS      Net charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of average loans improved to   0.06%   and   0.11%   in the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   0.25%   and   0.22%  , for the same periods a year ago. Nonaccrual loans were  

$175.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $201.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 6   summarizes delinquency and loss rates by state for our real estate 1-4 family first mortgage portfolio. 

Table 6:     Real Estate 1-4 Family First Mortgage Portfolio Performance    

12 

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY JUNIOR LIEN MORTGAGE LOANS   Our junior lien portfolio includes real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans secured by real estate. Predominantly all of our junior lien loans are amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between 5 to 30 years. Junior lien loans with balloon payments at the end of the repayment term represent less than 1% of our junior lien loans. We frequently monitor the credit performance of our junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of loss. Net charge-offs (annualized) as a  

percentage of average loans improved to   0.27%   and   0.64%   in the   third   quarter and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   0.92%   and   1.07%  , respectively, for the same periods a year ago. Nonaccrual loans were   $50.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $64.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 7   summarizes delinquency and loss rates by state for our junior lien portfolio. 

Table 7:     Real Estate 1-4 Family Junior Lien Portfolio Performance    

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS)    Table 8   summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for each of the last five quarters  .   We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when:  
             
    the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower's financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any); 
                
    they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest  

or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of collection;  
             
    part of the principal balance has been charged off; 
                
    for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien delinquency status; or 
                
    consumer loans are discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of their delinquency status.  

Table 8:     Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)    

           (1) 
    Excludes PCI loans because they continue to earn interest income from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms. 

13 

Total NPAs were   $231.7 million   (  0.69%   of total loans) at   September 30, 2016  , and included   $228.3 million   of nonaccrual loans. Total NPAs were   $270.0 million   (  2.04%   of total loans) at   December 31, 2015  , and included   $268.0 million   of nonaccrual loans. The decrease in third quarter   2016   was due in part to improving economic conditions and the Bank's proactive credit risk management activities.  
  Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status  

in accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that are paid down, charged off while on nonaccrual status, or sold, transferred to foreclosed properties, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.   Table 9   provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans. 

Table 9:     Analysis of Changes in Nonaccrual Loans    

14 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)   The recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs is provided in   Table 10  . The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was   $75.7 million   and   $74.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note 2 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more information. Those loans discharged in bankruptcy and reported as TDRs have been written down to net realizable collateral value. 
  In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance) and charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible. 

For more information on our nonaccrual policies when a restructuring is involved, see the "Risk Management - Credit Risk Management - Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) section of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Table 11   provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as foreclosures, we may remove loans from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan. 

Table 10:     Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)    

  Table 11:     Analysis of Changes in TDRs   

           (1) 
    Inflows include loans that both modify and resolve within the period as well as advances on loans that modified in a prior period. 
              (2) 
    Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments. No loans were removed from TDR classification in the quarters ended   September 30  ,   June 30,   and   March 31,     2016  , and   December 31  , and   September 30,     2015  , as a result of being refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualifying as new loans.  
              (3) 
    Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved. Our experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing the program requirements.  

15 

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING    Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days past due.  

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at   September 30, 2016   were down   $7.0 million   from   December 31, 2015  , due to payoffs, modifications and other loss mitigation activities, and credit stabilization. 
  Table 12   reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing. 

Table 12:     Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing (1)   

           (1) 
    PCI loans of   $2.3 million  , $  2.4 million  ,   $3.1 million  ,   $4.4 million   and   $4.6 million   at   September 30  ,   June 30  , and   March 31  ,   2016  , and   December 31  , and   September 30  ,   2015  , respectively, are excluded from this disclosure even though they are 90 days or more contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms. 
        
  NET CHARGE-OFFS    Table 13   presents net charge-offs for   third   quarter   2016   and the previous four quarters. Net charge-offs in   third   quarter   2016   were   $3.2 million   (  0.06%   of average  

total loans outstanding) compared with   $8.9 million   (  0.27%   of average total loans outstanding) in   third   quarter   2015  . Substantially all net losses were in consumer real estate. 

Table 13:     Net Charge-offs   

           (1) 
    Quarterly net charge-offs (net recoveries) as a percentage of average loans are annualized. 
         
  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES    The allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date. The detail of the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 2 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
  We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This process takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality 
  ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we  

review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools.  
  The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and marketability of collateral. Substantially all of our nonaccrual loans were real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The allowance for loan losses increased   $9.8 million   to   $130.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $120.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  , due to commercial and consumer loan growth through acquisition, partially offset by continued improvement in the housing environment.   Third   quarter   2016   provision for credit losses was   $18.7 million   compared with a  

16 

reversal of provision for credit losses of   $23.0 million   for the same period a year ago. We had an allowance build of   $15.5 million   in third quarter 2016, compared to a release from the allowance of   $31.9 million   in third quarter 2015. For the first nine months of   2016  , the provision for credit losses was   $30.2 million   compared with a reversal of provision for credit losses of   $23.9 million   a year ago. The higher level of provision in the third quarter and first nine months of   2016   compared with a year ago reflected loan growth as well as moderation in the rate of delinquency improvement. 
  We believe the allowance for credit losses at   September 30, 2016   was appropriate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The allowance for credit losses is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and  

external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Future allowance levels will be based on a variety of factors, including loan portfolio composition, size and performance, and the general economic environment, including housing market conditions. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the  Critical Accounting Policy  section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report and in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  Table 14   presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 14:     Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)

Asset/Liability Management 
  Asset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk and liquidity and funding. 
  INTEREST RATE RISK   Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   15%   of our loans had variable interest rates. In a declining rate environment, we may experience a reduction in interest income on our loan portfolio and a corresponding decrease in funds available to be distributed to our shareholders. The reduction in interest income may result from downward adjustment of the indices upon which the interest rates on loans are based and from prepayments of loans with fixed interest rates, resulting in reinvestment of the proceeds in lower yielding assets. To manage interest rate risk, we monitor loan pay-down rates, portfolio composition, and the rate sensitivity of loans acquired. Our loan acquisition process attempts to balance desirable yields with the quality of loans acquired. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   85%   of our loans had fixed interest rates. Such loans increase our interest rate risk. Our methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of interest-rate sensitivity  gap,  which is defined as the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets. Our interest rate-sensitive liabilities are generally limited to our line of credit with the Bank. 
  During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. Because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions, changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution is perfectly matched in each maturity category. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   15%   of our assets had variable interest rates, and could be expected to reprice with changes in interest rates. At   September 30, 2016  , our liabilities were   4%   of our assets. This positive gap between our assets and liabilities indicates that an increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income and a decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in net interest income. 
    
  LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING   The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, Wells Fargo s Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee establishes and monitors liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets.    
  Proceeds received from pay-downs of loans are typically sufficient to fund existing lending commitments and loan acquisitions. Depending upon the timing of the loan acquisitions, we may draw on our   $2.2 billion   revolving line of credit we have with the Bank as a short-term liquidity source. At  

September 30, 2016  , there was   $1.4 billion   outstanding on our Bank line of credit. The rate of interest on the line of credit is equal to the average federal funds rate plus 12.5 basis points. 
  Our primary liquidity needs are to pay operating expenses, fund our lending commitments, acquire loans to replace existing loans that mature or repay, and pay dividends. The retained deficit included within our balance sheet results from cumulative distributions that have exceeded GAAP net income, predominantly due to the impact on REIT taxable income of purchase accounting adjustments attributable to the Company during the years 2009 through 2013, from the 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corporation by Wells Fargo. The excess dividend distributions were funded by using cash provided by investing (generally principal payments received on our loans) and financing activities (generally draws on our Bank line of credit). As the remaining purchase accounting adjustments are not expected to cause a significant variance between GAAP net income and REIT taxable income in future years, operating expenses and dividends are expected to be funded through cash generated by operations or paid-in capital. Funding commitments and the acquisition of loans are intended to be funded with the proceeds obtained from repayment of principal balances by individual borrowers and our line of credit with the Bank.  
  On September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo  reached agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, regarding allegations that some of its retail customers received products and services they did not request. Negative publicity or public opinion resulting from the settlements and related matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to the business of Wells Fargo and the Bank, including the Bank s ability to originate loans at the same volumes as we have historically acquired. If in future periods we do not reinvest loan pay-downs at sufficient levels, management may request our board of directors to consider a return of capital to the holders of our common stock. Annually, we expect to distribute an aggregate amount of outstanding capital stock dividends equal to approximately 100% of our REIT taxable income for federal tax purposes. Such distributions may exceed net income determined under GAAP. 
  Using proceeds from the common stock issuance in   third   quarter   2016   as well as proceeds from loan pay-downs and payoffs, we acquired   $19.1 billion   of consumer loans and   $1.9 billion   of CSRE loans from the Bank. To the extent that we determine that additional funding is necessary or advisable, we could issue additional common or preferred stock, subject to Board of Directors approval, raise funds through debt financings, or a combination of these methods. Retention of cash flows does not represent a significant source of funding because any cash flow retention must be consistent with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Code, which requires the distribution by a REIT of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains, and must take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed income. 
  The certificate of designation for the Series A preferred stock contains a covenant in which we agree not to incur indebtedness for borrowed money, including any guarantees of indebtedness (which does not include any pledges of our assets on behalf of the Bank or our other affiliates), without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the Series A preferred stock, voting as a separate class, provided     that, we may incur indebtedness in an aggregate amount not exceeding 20% of our stockholders  equity.

Critical Accounting Policy 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our   2015   Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. We have identified the accounting policy covering allowance for credit losses as critical because it requires management to make difficult,  

subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.  
  Management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved this critical accounting policy. This policy is described in the "Critical Accounting Policy" section in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 15   provides accounting pronouncements applicable to us that have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective. 

Table 15:     Current Accounting Developments - Issued Standards                   Standard 
    Description 
    Effective date and financial statement impact 
      Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2016-15     Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
    The Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for reporting in the Statement of Cash Flows. 
    The Update is effective for us in first quarter 2018 with retrospective application. We are evaluating the impact the Update will have on our financial statements. 
    
      ASU 2016-13     Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    The Update changes the accounting for credit losses on loans by requiring a current expected credit loss (CECL) approach to determine the allowance for credit losses. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Also, the Update eliminates the existing guidance for purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, but requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than insignificant deterioration since origination. 
    The guidance is effective for us in first quarter 2020 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted beginning in first quarter 2019. While we are evaluating the impact the Update will have on our financial statements, we expect the Update will result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses given the change to estimated losses for the estimated life of the financial asset. The amount of the increase will be impacted by the portfolio composition and quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. 
      ASU 2016-01 -   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    The Update amends the accounting, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial instruments, including financial instruments measured at amortized cost. 
    The Update is effective for us in first quarter 2018 and should be applied with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the adoption period. Early adoption is prohibited for the amendments applicable to us. We are evaluating the impact of the Update on our financial statements.  
      ASU 2014-09 -   Revenue from Contracts With Customers   (Topic 606) and subsequent related Updates 
    The Update modifies the guidance companies use to recognize revenue from contracts with customers for transfers of goods or services and transfers of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including information about contract balances and performance obligations. 
    In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 (  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to first quarter 2018. Early adoption is permitted in first quarter 2017. Predominantly all of our revenue is from net interest income on financial assets and liabilities, which is explicitly excluded from the scope of the update. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Update to our noninterest income and on our presentation and disclosures. We expect to adopt the update in first quarter 2018 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Report contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as  anticipates,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   target ,  projects,   outlook,   forecast,   will,   may,   could,   should,   can  and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: future results of WFREIC; expectations for consumer and commercial credit performance and the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses; our expectations regarding net interest income; expectations regarding loan acquisitions and pay-downs; future capital expenditures; future dividends and other capital distributions; the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and our plans, objectives and strategies.  
  Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 
             
    economic conditions that affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits, including our borrowers  prepayment and repayment of our loans; 
                
    losses relating to Hurricane Matthew, including as to our consumer and commercial loan portfolios, the extent of damage or loss to our collateral for loans in our portfolios or the unavailability of adequate insurance coverage or government assistance for our borrowers; 
                
    the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income;  
                
    the level and volatility of the capital markets, interest rates, currency values and other market indices that affect the value of our assets and liabilities; 
                
    the effect of political conditions and geopolitical events; 
                
    losses relating to natural disasters, including  ,   with respect to our loan portfolio, damage or loss to the collateral  

underlying loans in our portfolio or the unavailability of adequate insurance coverage or government assistance for borrowers; 
             
    adverse developments in the availability of desirable investment opportunities, whether they are due to competition, regulation or otherwise; 
                
    the extent of loan modification efforts, as well as the effects of regulatory requirements or guidance regarding loan modifications; 
                
    the availability and cost of both credit and capital; 
                
    investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets;  
                
    our reputation and the reputation of Wells Fargo and the Bank, including negative effects from the Bank's retail banking sales practices matter; 
                
    financial services reform and the impact of other current, pending and future legislation, regulation and legal actions applicable to us, the Bank or Wells Fargo, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) and related regulations, and the final definition of qualified mortgage issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; 
                
    changes in accounting standards, rules and interpretations; 
                
    various monetary and fiscal policies and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments; 
                
    a failure in or breach of our, the Bank s or Wells Fargo s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third party vendors and other security providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; and 
        
  In addition to the above factors, we also caution that our allowance for credit losses currently may not be appropriate to cover future credit losses, especially if housing prices decline  ,   unemployment worsens, or general economic conditions deteriorate. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. 
  Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in Wells Fargo Real Estate Investment Corporation involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition and the value  

of, and return on, an investment in WFREIC, refer to the  Risk Factors  section in our   2015   Form

Controls and Procedures 
    
                       Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company's management evaluated the effectiveness, as of   September 30, 2016  , of our disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
                       Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 
             
    pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; 
                
    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
                
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during   third   quarter   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Wells Fargo Real Estate Investment Corporation (the Company, we, our or us) is an indirect subsidiary of both Wells Fargo   Company (Wells Fargo) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Bank). The Company, a Delaware corporation, has operated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) since its formation in 1996. 
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  2015   Form 10-K). There were no material changes to these policies in the first nine months of   2016  . The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual future conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates related to the allowance for credit losses (Note 2 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses)). Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the full year. The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Accounting Standards Adopted in   2016    
  In first quarter   2016  , we adopted the following new accounting guidance: 
   Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.  

ASU 2015-01   removes the concept of extraordinary items from 
  GAAP and eliminates the requirement for extraordinary items to 
  be separately presented in the statement of income. We adopted the Update in first quarter 2016 with prospective application. The Update did not impact our financial statements. 
    
  Accounting Standards with Retrospective Application   The following accounting pronouncement has been issued by the FASB but is not yet effective: 

ASU 2016-15   addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for reporting in the Statement of Cash Flows. The Update is effective for us in first quarter 2018 with retrospective application. We are evaluating the impact the Update will have on our financial statements. 
    
  Subsequent Events    
  We have evaluated the effects of events that have occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . There were no material subsequent events requiring adjustment to the financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements. During the first week of October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused destruction along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina and resulted in, among other things, property damage for our customers and the closing of many businesses. We are currently assessing the impact to our customers and our business as a result of Hurricane Matthew. The financial impact to us is expected to relate to our consumer and commercial real estate loan portfolios and will depend on a number of factors, including the types of loans most affected by the hurricane, the extent of damage to our collateral, the extent of available insurance coverage, the availability of government assistance for our borrowers, and whether our borrowers  ability to repay their loans has been diminished.

Note 2: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company acquires loans originated or purchased by the Bank. In order to maintain our status as a REIT, the composition of the loans is highly concentrated in real estate. The majority of our loans are concentrated in California, New York, Washington, Virginia and Florida. These markets include approximately   58%   of our total loan balance at   September 30, 2016  .  

The following table presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable. Outstanding balances include a total net addition of   $76.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and a net reduction of   $301.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  , for unamortized premiums and discounts. 

The following table summarizes the proceeds paid or received from the Bank for acquisitions and sales of loans, respectively. 

Commitments to Lend 
  The contract or notional amount of commercial loan commitments to extend credit was   $551.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $399.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Pledged Loans 
  See Note 5 (Transactions With Related Parties) for additional details on our agreement with the Bank to pledge loans. 

27 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
    The following table presents the allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments.  

(1) 
    Certain impaired loans with an allowance calculated by discounting expected cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate over the remaining life of the loan recognize changes in allowance attributable to the passage of time as interest income.  
     
   28 

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses by our commercial and consumer portfolio segments. 

The following table disaggregates our allowance for credit losses and recorded investment in loans by impairment methodology. 

(1) 
    Represents loans collectively evaluated for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20,   Loss Contingencies   (formerly FAS 5), and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding allowance for non-impaired loans.  
              (2) 
    Represents loans individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10,   Receivables   (formerly FAS 114), and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding allowance for impaired loans.  
              (3) 
    Represents the allowance and related loan carrying value determined in accordance with ASC 310-30  , Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality   (formerly SOP 03-3) and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding allowance for PCI loans. 

29 

Credit Quality 
  We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. The following sections provide the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit quality indicators are generally based on information as of our financial statement date, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-value (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators are updated in the second month of each quarter, with updates no older than   June 30, 2016  . 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS     In addition to monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. Generally commercial loans are subject to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to Pass and Criticized categories. The Criticized category includes Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful categories which are defined by bank regulatory agencies. 
  The table below provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial loans by risk category.  

The following table provides past due information for commercial loans, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices. 

30 

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS   We have various classes of consumer loans that present unique risks. Loan delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV/CLTV for loan types are common credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segment.  
  The majority of our loss estimation techniques used for the allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency matrix models or  

delinquency roll rate models. Therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality and the establishment of our allowance for credit losses.  
  The following table provides the outstanding balances of our consumer portfolio by delinquency status. 

31 

The following table provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio by FICO. FICO is not available for certain loan types and may not be obtained if we deem it unnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. 

32 

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan s unpaid principal balance to the property s collateral value. CLTV refers to the combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage ratios. LTVs and CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties, generally with an original value of   $1 million   or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. 

The following table shows the most updated LTV and CLTV distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loan portfolios. We consider the trends in residential real estate markets as we monitor credit risk and establish our allowance for credit losses. In the event of a default, any loss should be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions. 

(1) 
    Reflects total loan balances with LTV/CLTV amounts in excess of 100%. In the event of default, the loss content would generally be limited to only the amount in excess of 100% LTV/CLTV. 

33 

NONACCRUAL LOANS    The following table provides loans on nonaccrual status. PCI loans are excluded from this table due to the existence of the accretable yield.   

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING    Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days past due. PCI loans of   $2.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $4.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  , are excluded from this disclosure even though they are 90 days or more contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms. 
  The following table shows non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing. 

34 

Impaired Loans    The table below summarizes key information for impaired loans. Our impaired loans predominantly include loans on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio segment and loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. These impaired loans generally have estimated losses which are included in the allowance for credit losses. We have impaired loans with no allowance for credit losses when loss content has been  

previously recognized through charge-offs and we do not anticipate additional charge-offs or losses, or certain loans are currently performing in accordance with their terms and for which no loss has been estimated. Impaired loans exclude PCI loans. The table below includes trial modifications that totaled   $12.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $15.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 

35 

The following table provides the average recorded investment in impaired loans and the amount of interest income recognized on impaired loans by portfolio segment and class. 

(1) 
    Includes interest recognized on accruing TDRs, interest recognized related to certain impaired loans which have an allowance calculated using discounting, and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments related to certain impaired loans. 
       
    Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDRs)   When, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of which totaled   $468.9 million   and   $502.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We do not consider any loans modified through a loan resolution such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. 
  We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned permanent modification, to determine if they can perform according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not considered modified and they continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Most of the planned modifications for these arrangements involve interest rate reductions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not finalized and do not take effect until the loan is permanently modified. The trial period terms are developed in accordance with our proprietary programs or the U.S. Treasury s Making Homes Affordable programs for real estate 1-4 family first lien (i.e. Home Affordable Modification Program - HAMP) and junior lien (i.e. Second Lien Modification Program - 2MP) mortgage loans.  

At   September 30, 2016  , the loans in trial modification period were   $6.2 million   under HAMP,   $774 thousand   under 2MP and   $5.9 million   under proprietary programs, compared with   $7.4 million  ,   $663 thousand   and   $7.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Trial modifications with a recorded investment of   $4.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $5.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  , were accruing loans and   $8.0 million   and   $9.9 million  , respectively, were nonaccruing loans. Our experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing the program requirements and are then permanently modified at the end of the trial period. As previously discussed, our allowance process considers the impact of those modifications that are probable to occur including the associated credit cost and related re-default risk. 
   For those loans that may be modified more than once, the following table reflects each modification that occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and pay off within the period, as well as changes in recorded investment during the period for loans modified in prior periods, are not included in the table. 

36 

37 

(1) 
    Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only once in the first modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of   $2.7 million   and   $5.2 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $6.9 million   and   $13.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate. 
              (3) 
    Other concessions include loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the interest rate.  
              (4) 
    Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. Modifications resulted in legally forgiving principal (actual, contingent or deferred) of   $290 thousand   and   $1.1 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $1.0 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (5) 
    Reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans reported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 
              (6) 
    Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the current period.

The table below summarizes permanent modification TDRs that have defaulted in the current period within 12 months of their permanent modification date. We report these defaulted  

TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for the consumer portfolio segment.

Note 3: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. We did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments as permitted in FASB ASC 825,   Financial Instruments  , which allows companies to elect to carry certain financial instruments at fair value with corresponding changes in fair value reported in the results of operations. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were less than   1%   of total assets. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information about our fair value measurement policies and methods.  

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments     The table below is a summary of fair value estimates by level for financial instruments. The carrying amounts in the following table are recorded in the balance sheet under the indicated captions. 
  We have not included assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments in our disclosure, such as other assets and other liabilities. The total of the fair value calculations presented does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. 

(1) 
    Amounts consist of financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value. 
              (2) 
    Carrying amount reflects net discount and allowance for loan losses.

Note 4: Common and Preferred Stock 

The following table provides details of our authorized common and preferred stock. 

In the event that the Company is liquidated or dissolved, the holders of the Series A and Series B preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference for each security plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends that will be paid prior to any payments to common stockholders. With respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation preference, the Series A preferred stock ranks on parity with Series B preferred stock and senior to the Company s common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock to affiliates of Wells Fargo without further action by the Series A or Series B stockholders. Additional information related to Series A and B preferred stock is included in Note 5 (Common and Preferred Stock) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  On August 26, 2016, the Company issued and sold   21.2 million   shares of the Company s common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of   $20.0 billion  . The shares were sold to affiliates of the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance to acquire REIT Qualified Assets (as described in the our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) from affiliates. Following the issuance, indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. continue to own   100%   of the Company s common stock.

Note 5: Transactions With Related Parties 

The Company engages in various transactions and agreements with affiliated parties in the ordinary course of business. Due to the common ownership of the Company and the affiliated parties by Wells Fargo, these transactions and agreements may reflect circumstances and considerations that could differ from  

those conducted with unaffiliated parties. The principal items related to transactions with affiliated parties included in the accompanying statement of income and balance sheet are described in the table and narrative below. 

Loans     We acquire and sell loans to and from the Bank. The acquisitions and sales are transacted at fair value resulting in acquisition discounts and premiums or gains and losses on sales. The net acquisition discount accretion is reported within interest income. Gains or losses on sales of loans are included within noninterest income. We may pledge our loans in an aggregate amount not exceeding   80%   of our total assets at any time as collateral on behalf of the Bank for the Bank s access to secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home Loan Banks or the discount window of Federal Reserve Banks. In exchange for the pledge of our loan assets, the Bank will pay us a fee that is consistent with market terms. At   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the fee was equal to an annual rate of 28 basis points (  0.28%  ) and 11 basis points (  0.11%  ), respectively, as applied to the unpaid principal balance of pledged loans on a monthly basis. Such fee may be renegotiated by us and the Bank from time to time. 
  Loan Servicing Costs     The loans in our portfolio are predominantly serviced by the Bank pursuant to the terms of participation and servicing and assignment agreements. In some instances, the Bank has delegated servicing responsibility to third parties that are not affiliated with us or the Bank. Depending on the loan type, the monthly servicing fee charges are based in part on (a) outstanding principal balances, (b) a flat fee per month, or (c) a total loan commitment amount. 
  Management Fees     We pay the Bank a management fee to reimburse for general overhead expenses, including allocations  

of technology support and a combination of finance and accounting, risk management and other general overhead expenses incurred on our behalf. Management fees are calculated based on Wells Fargo s total allocable costs multiplied by a formula. The formula is based on our proportion of Wells Fargo s consolidated: (1) full-time equivalent employees, (2) total average assets and (3) total revenue. 
  Deposits     Interest income earned on deposits is included in interest income. Our cash management process includes applying operating cash flows to reduce any outstanding balance on our line of credit with the Bank. Operating cash flows are settled through our affiliate accounts receivable/payable process. Upon settlement cash received is either applied to reduce our line of credit outstanding or retained as a deposit with the Bank. 
  Foreclosed Assets     We sell foreclosed assets back to the Bank from time to time at estimated fair value. 
  Line of Credit     We have a revolving line of credit with the Bank, pursuant to which we can borrow up to   $2.2 billion   at a rate of interest equal to the average federal funds rate plus   12.5   basis points (  0.125%  ). 
  Accounts Receivable - Affiliates, Net   Accounts receivable from or payable to the Bank or its affiliates result from intercompany transactions which include net loan pay-downs, interest receipts, and other transactions, including those transactions noted herein, which have not yet settled.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 
    
  WFREIC is not currently involved in nor, to our knowledge, currently threatened with any material litigation. From time to time we may become involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the eventual outcome of any such routine litigation will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, could be material to our financial statements for any particular period.

(2) 
    These computations are included herein in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. However, management believes that fixed charge ratios are not meaningful measures for the business of Wells Fargo Real Estate Investment Corporation. For example, even if there was no change in net income, the ratios would decline if interest income and interest expense increase by the same amount due to an increase in the level of interest rates or, conversely, they would increase if interest income and interest expense decrease by the same amount due to a decrease in the level of interest rates.
