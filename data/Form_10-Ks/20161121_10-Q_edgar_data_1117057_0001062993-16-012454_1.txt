REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To:  
     The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

American Lorain Corporation
   
 We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated balance
sheets of American Lorain Corporation ( the Company ) as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, and the related statements of income and cash flows for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  
 We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and
making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim consolidated
financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  
 We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
balance sheets of American Lorain Corporation as of December 31, 2015, and the
related statements of income, comprehensive income, retained earnings, and cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated
April 14, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying
condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from which it has been
derived.

1.   
     
        ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND PRINCIPAL
      ACTIVITIES      

(a)   
     
        Organization history of American Lorain Corporation
      (formerly known as Millennium Quest, Inc.)     
 American Lorain Corporation (the
 Company  or  ALN ) was originally a Delaware corporation incorporated on
February 4, 1986. On November 12, 2009, the Company filed a statement of merger
in the state of Nevada to transfer the Company s jurisdiction from Delaware to
Nevada.  

(b)   
     
        Organization history of International Lorain Holding
      Inc. and its subsidiaries     
 ALN owns 100% of the equity of
International Lorain Holding Inc. ( ILH ). ILH is a Cayman Islands company
incorporated on August 4, 2006 and was wholly-owned by Mr. Hisashi Akazawa until
May 3, 2007. ILH presently has two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Junan
Hongrun and Luotian Lorain, and three indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries
through Junan Hongrun, which are Beijing Lorain, Dongguan Lorain, and Shandong
Greenpia Foodstuff Co., Ltd. ( Shandong Greenpia ).  
 In addition, the Company directly and
indirectly has 80.2% ownership of Shandong Lorain. The rest of the 19.8%, which
is owned by the State under the name of Shandong Economic Development Investment
Co. Ltd., is not included as a part of the Group.  
 On April 9, 2009, the Company, through
its Junan Hongrun subsidiary, invested cash to establish Dongguan Lorain.
Dongguan Lorain is indirectly 100% beneficially owned by the Company. 
 On June 28, 2010, the Company signed
an equity transfer agreement with Shandong Greenpia. Shandong Greenpia was
originally directly owned by Taebong Inc. and Shandong Luan Trade Company. The
Company paid $2,100,000to Korean Taebong Inc. for 50% equity of Shandong
Greenpia on September 20, 2010. On September 23, 2010, the Company issued
731,707 shares of restricted stock at an agreed price of $2.87 per share to the
owner of Shandong Luan Trade Company, Mr. Ji Zhenwei, for the remaining 50%
equity of Shandong Greenpia. Since September 23, 2010, Shandong Greenpia was
directly owned by both Junan Hongrun and ILH. As a result, Shandong Greenpia is
100% owned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company booked a gain of $383,482
which is included in the statement of income as other income.  
 On February 7,
2014, American Lorain Corporation, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary,
Junan Hongrun, entered into two Share Purchase Agreements with Intiraimi, a
limited liability company organized under the laws of France, and Biobranco II,
a company organized under Portuguese law, to acquire 51% of the share capital of
Athena Group. On June 30, 2014, Junan Hongrun officially completed the
acquisition. On August 8, 2015, the Company re-organized its
French operations by merging the operations of Conserverie Minerve into its
immediate parent and 100% shareholder Athena, and concurrently, Athena wound up
and dissolved Conserverie Minerve. Athena subsequently changed its own legal
name to Conservie Minerve to continue its business. Minerve received a court order to enter into bankruptcy
liquidation proceedings on April 19, 2016. Consequently, as of September 30, 2016, Minerve was deconsolidated from the Company due to
the loss in control resulting from such proceedings. For additional information,
please refer to Note 24   Subsequent Events.  

(c)   
     
        Business Activities     
 The Company develops, manufactures,
and sells convenience foods (including ready-to-cook (or RTC) foods;
ready-to-eat (or RTE) foods and meals ready-to-eat (or MRE); chestnut products;
and frozen foods, in hundreds of varieties. The Company operates through
indirect Chinese and European subsidiaries. The products are sold in domestic
markets as well as exported to foreign countries and regions such as Japan,
Korea and Europe.

AMERICAN LORAIN CORPORATION    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015
   (Stated in US Dollars)   

2.   
     
        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
  POLICIES      

(a)   
     
        Method of accounting     
 The Company maintains its general
ledger and journals with the accrual method accounting for financial reporting
purposes. The financial statements and notes are representations of management.
Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America and have been consistently
applied in the presentation of financial statements, which are compiled on the
accrual basis of accounting.  
 The Company regrouped certain accounts
in its presentation of changes in assets and liabilities in the statement of
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in order to be
consistent with the presentation provided for the year ended December 31, 2015.
There was no impact on earnings for the regrouping.  

(b)   
     
        Principles of
consolidation     
 The consolidated financial statements
which include the Company and its subsidiaries are compiled in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
consolidated financial statements include 100% of assets, liabilities, and net
income or loss of those wholly-owned subsidiaries; ownership interests of
non-controlling investors are recorded as non-controlling interests.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the detailed
identities of the consolidating subsidiaries are as follows:  
 
 As of September 30, 2016, Minerve was
deconsolidated from the Company due to the loss in control resulting from
Minerve s entry into bankruptcy liquidation proceedings following a court order.
The audited accounts of Minerve at December 31, 2015 have not been
deconsolidated and reclassified as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings.  

(c)   
     
        Use of estimates     
 The preparation of the financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the
time the estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially
from those estimates.    

(d)   
     
        Cash and cash equivalents     
 The Company considers all highly
liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015
   (Stated in US Dollars)   

(e)   
     
        Investment securities     
 The Company classifies securities it
holds for investment purposes into trading or available-for-sale. Trading
securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in
the near term. All securities not included in trading securities are classified
as available-for-sale.  
 Trading and available-for-sale
securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on
trading securities are included in the net income. Unrealized holding gains and
losses, net of the related tax effect, on available for sale securities are
excluded from net income and are reported as a separate component of other
comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis.
 
 A decline in the market value of any
available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary
results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is
charged as an expense to the statement of income and comprehensive income and a
new cost basis for the security is established. To determine whether impairment
is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and
intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers
whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the
reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes
in value subsequent to year end, and forecasted performance of the investee.
 
 Premiums and discounts are amortized
or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an
adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. Dividend and interest
income are recognized when earned.  

(f)   
     
        Trade receivables     
 Trade receivables are recognized and
carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible
amounts. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred.  

(g)   
     
        Inventories     
 Inventories consisting of finished
goods and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
Finished goods are comprised of direct materials, direct labor and an
appropriate proportion of overhead.  

(h)   
     
        Customer deposits and advances to
  suppliers     
 Customer deposits were received from
customers in connection with orders of products to be delivered in future
periods. 
 Advance to suppliers is a good faith
deposit paid to the supplier for the purpose of committing the supplier to
provide product promptly upon delivery of the Company s purchase order for raw
materials, supplies, equipment, building materials, and other items necessary
for our operations. Pursuant to the Company s arrangements with its suppliers,
this deposit is generally 20% of the total amount contracted for. This type of
transaction is classified as a prepayment under the account name  Advance to
Suppliers  until such time as the Company s purchase order is delivered, at
which point this account is reduced by reclassification of the applicable amount
to the appropriate asset account such as inventory or fixed assets or
construction in progress.

(i)   
     
        Property, plant and
equipment      
 Plant and equipment are carried at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with a salvage value of
10%. Estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:  

The cost and related accumulated
depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the
accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of income. The cost
of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant
renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

(j)   
     
        Construction in progress     
 Construction in progress represents
direct and indirect construction or acquisition costs. The construction in
progress is transferred to plant and equipment when substantially all the
activities necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use are completed.
No depreciation is provided until the asset is completed and ready for intended
use. 

(k)   
     
        Land use rights     
 Land use rights are carried at cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over a specified period. Amortization is
provided using the straight-line method over 40-50 years.

Company are reviewed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Subtopic 360-10-35,
 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could
become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Impairment
is present if carrying amount of an asset is less than its undiscounted cash
flows to be generated.  
 If an asset is considered impaired, a
loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair market value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The Company
believes no impairment has occurred to its assets during 2016 and 2015.

        Retirement benefits     
 Retirement benefits in the form of
contributions under defined contribution retirement plans to the relevant
authorities are charged to the consolidated statement of income as incurred.

(q)   
     
        Income taxes     
 The Company accounts for income tax
using an asset and liability approach and allows for recognition of deferred tax
benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes
are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire
before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future realization
is uncertain.  
 The Company has implemented ASC Topic
740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  Income tax liabilities computed according to
the United States, People s Republic of China (PRC), and France tax laws are
provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial
statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related
primarily to differences between the basis of fixed assets and intangible assets
for financial and tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will be
either taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or
settled. Deferred taxes also are recognized for operating losses that are
available to offset future income taxes. A valuation allowance is created to
evaluate deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will
either expire before the Company is able to realize that tax benefit, or that
future realization is uncertain.  
 Effective January 1, 2008, PRC
government implemented a new 25% tax rate across the board for all enterprises
regardless of whether domestic or foreign enterprise without any tax holiday
which is defined as "two-year exemption followed by three-year half exemption"
hitherto enjoyed by tax payers. As a result of the new tax law of a standard 25%
tax rate, tax holidays terminated as of December 31, 2007. However, PRC
government has established a set of transition rules to allow enterprises that
were already participating in tax holidays before January 1, 2008, to continue
enjoying the tax holidays until they had been fully utilized.  
 The standard corporate income tax in
France is 33.33% except for a small or new business, which may benefit from
lower rates. In addition, a 3.3% of social surcharge is charged to the Company s
French subsidiaries if the standard corporate income tax liability exceeds EUR
763,000. Furthermore, a 10.7% temporary surtax applies when a company s turnover
exceeds EUR 250 million. 
 The Company is subject to United
States Tax according to Internal Revenue Code Sections 951 and 957. Corporate
income tax is imposed at progressive rates in the range of: -

(r)   
     
        Statutory reserves     
 Statutory reserves are referring to
the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with laws or
regulations, which can be used to recover losses and increase capital, as
approved, and are to be used to expand production or operations. The Company did
not make any transfers from retained earnings to statutory reserves for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. PRC laws prescribe that an enterprise
operating at a profit must appropriate and reserve, on an annual basis, an
amount equal to 10% of its profit. Such an appropriation is necessary until the
reserve reaches a maximum that is equal to 50% of the enterprise s PRC
registered capital.  

(s)   
     
        Foreign currency
translation     
 The accompanying financial statements
are presented in United States dollars. The functional currencies of the Company
are the Renminbi (RMB) and the Euro (EUR). The financial statements are
translated into United States dollars from RMB and EUR at year-end exchange
rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues and
expenses. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates
when the capital transactions occurred. 
 
 The RMB is not freely convertible into
foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through
authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could
have been, or could be, converted into US Dollars at the rates used in
translation.  

(t)   
     
        Revenue recognition     
 The Company's revenue recognition
policies are in compliance with Staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales
revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal
arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is
completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the
relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned
revenue. 
 The Company's revenue consists of
invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). The Company allows its
customers to return products if they are defective. However, this rarely happens
and amounts returned have been de minimis. 

(u)   
     
        Earnings per share     
 Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding and potential dilutive securities during the year. For the year
ended December 31, 2009, 1,334,573 stock options were granted to employees
pursuant to the Company s equity incentive plan; 2,255,024 warrants were issued
to investors in connection with a PIPE financing. For the year ended December
31, 2010, 81,155 warrants were issued to certain service providers. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, no warrants were issued nor were options granted. As of
December 31, 2015, 1,753,909 shares of Series A warrants had expired and all
stock options to employees from the 2009 stock incentive program have expired.
These warrants and options could be potentially dilutive if the market price of
the Company s common stock exceeds the exercise price for these securities.  
 The Company computes earnings per
share ( EPS ) in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per share  and SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 ( SAB 98 ). SFAS No. 128 requires companies
with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is
measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a
per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities,
options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the
periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have
an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease
loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

        Financial instruments     
 The Company s financial instruments,
including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts and
other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, have carrying amounts
that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value
of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial
Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the
consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify
as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values
because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The
three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:  

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted
      prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.    

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include
      quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and
      inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
      indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are
      unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
      
 The Company analyzes all financial
instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480,
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,  and ASC 815.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company did not identify any assets and liabilities whose carrying
amounts were required to be adjusted in order to present them at fair value.

(w)   
     
        Commitments and
contingencies     
 Liabilities for loss contingencies
arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other
sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.  

(x)   
     
        Comprehensive income     
 Comprehensive income is defined to
include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners
and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, all items that are
required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of
comprehensive income are required to be reported in a financial statement that
is presented with the same prominence as other financial statements. The
Company s current component of other comprehensive income includes the foreign
currency translation adjustment and unrealized gain or loss.  
 The Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220,
 Reporting Comprehensive Income . Comprehensive income is comprised of net
income and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except the
changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders due to investments
by stockholders. Comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 included net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.

        Goodwill     
 Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets
acquired in a business combination. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", goodwill is no longer subject to
amortization. Rather, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment, applying a fair-value based test. Fair value is generally determined
using a discounted cash flow analysis.  

(z)   
     
        Recent accounting
pronouncements     
 On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-01  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which amends the
guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it
significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification
and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of
certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The
ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value
of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. 
 On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842) , its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU
2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet.
The new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor
model with those in ASC 606, the FASB s new revenue recognition standard (e.g.,
those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized). 
 Furthermore, the ASU addresses other
concerns related to the current leases model. For example, the ASU eliminates
the requirement in current U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in
determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase
the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets
and how they manage that exposure. The new model represents a wholesale change
to lease accounting. As a result, entities will face significant implementation
challenges during the transition period and beyond, such as those related
to: 

Applying judgment and estimating.    

Managing the complexities of data collection, storage,
      and maintenance.    

Enhancing information technology systems to ensure their
      ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with
      reporting requirements.    

Refining internal controls and other business processes
      related to leases.    

Determining whether debt covenants are likely to be
      affected and, if so, working with lenders to avoid violations.    

Addressing any income tax implications.
    
 The new guidance will be effective for
public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018
(e.g., calendar periods beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods
therein. 
 On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-07  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which simplifies the equity
method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the
equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting
as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity method (as
a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
influence), the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would
be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the
equity method would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor
obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. The ASU
further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income related to an available-for-sale security that becomes
eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which
the investment qualifies for the equity method.  
 The guidance in the ASU is effective
for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all
entities. Entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively to increases
in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU s effective date. Additional
transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.

 On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-08  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which amends the
principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the Board s
new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09). The FASB issued the ASU in response to
concerns identified by stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining
the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s
principal-versus-agent guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an
entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s
control principle. Among other things, the ASU clarifies that an entity should
evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or
service promised in a contract with a customer. As defined in the ASU, a
specified good or service is  a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle
of goods or services) to be provided to the customer.  Therefore, for contracts
involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the
principal for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others.
 
 The ASU has the same effective date as
the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early
adoption provisions in ASU 2015-14). In addition, entities are required to adopt
the ASU by using the same transition method they used to adopt the new revenue
standard.  
 On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-09  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and
nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the
statement of cash flows. 
 The ASU is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those annual reporting periods.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there are no
other recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could
have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

3.   
     
        RESTRICTED CASH     
 Restricted cash represents interest
bearing deposits placed with banks to secure banking facilities in the form of
loans and notes payable. The restriction of funds is based on time. The funds
that collateralize loans are held for 60 days in a savings account that pays
interest at the prescribed national daily savings account rate. For funds that
under lie notes payable, the cash is deposited in six month time deposits that
pay interest at the national time deposit rate.

The Company offers credit terms of

customers, and between 0 to 15 days for most of the third-party distributors the
Company works with.

        OTHER RECEIVABLES     
 Other receivables consisted of the
following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
 
 Advances to employees for job/travel
disbursements consisted of advances to employees for transportation, meals,
client entertainment, commissions, and procurement of certain raw materials. The
advances issued to employees may be carried for extended periods of time because
employees may spend several months out in the field working to procure new sales
contracts or fulfill existing contracts.  
 Specifically, the company uses
available employees of the purchasing department to arrange purchases with
desirable chestnut or other raw material growers. However, because many of these
growers are in rural farming areas of China where traditional banking and credit
arrangements are difficult to implement, the Company must utilize cash purchases
and also must contract for its future needs by placing a good faith deposit in
cash with the growers. None of these advances to employees for delivery to the
growers on behalf of the Company are  personal loans  to the employees. Advances
to employees for purchase of materials in other receivables are adjusted to
advances to suppliers as of September 30, 2016. 
 Related party receivables represented
advances issued by management for job or travel disbursement in the normal
course of business. The receivables had no impact on earnings. As with other
employees, officers sign notes when cash is issued to them as job or travel
disbursement. In order to satisfy certain criteria for obtaining the long-term
loan with DEG, as noted in footnote 11, Junan Hongrun lent money to Mr. You,
Huadong to purchase life insurance. Related party receivable amounts are
disclosed as  other related party receivables  in other receivables.  
 In September 2010, Shandong Lorain and
Junan Hengji Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. ("Junan Hengji") entered into a
cooperative development agreement (the "Agreement"), and in March 2011, Jiangsu
Heng An Industrial Investment Group Co., Ltd. ("Heng An Investment"), an
affiliated company of Junan Hengji also entered into the Agreement with Shandong
Lorain to jointly develop the project with Junan Hengji. Pursuant to the
Agreement, Shandong Lorain agreed to sell the Company s interest in the amount
of $7,764,577 (RMB 49,604,000) in a parcel of land located in Junan Town,
Shandong Province, to construct residential buildings by Junan Hengji and Heng
An Investment. The land was sold to Junan Hengji and Heng An Investment for a
total sales price of RMB 69,604,000 and a guaranteed gross profit of RMB
20,000,000 without consideration of the profit or loss of the residential
building project.  
 As of December 31, 2015, a total of RMB
42,029,955 has been received and there was an unpaid balance of RMB 27,574,045.
The Company filed suit against Junan Hengji and Heng An Investment in 2014 for a
claim of RMB 10,000,000, which is half of the original guaranteed profit of RMB
20,000,000. In deciding to bring suit, the Company evaluated the potential claims against Junan
Hengji and Heng An Investment, disputes between the parties with respect to out
of pocket expenses paid by Junan Hengji as well as the preliminary litigation
fee that Shandong Lorain was required to pay to the court by based upon the
amount in dispute. Shandong Lorain decided to file the lawsuit with the Linyi
City Intermediate People's Court to claim a fixed return of RMB 10 million
(approximately US$1,499,390).

 On March 21, 2015, Shandong Lorain
received the Linyi City Intermediate People's Court decision that rejected
Shandong Lorain's claim for RMB 10 million against Junan Hengji and Heng An
Investment. On April 3, 2015, Shandong Lorain appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court of Shandong Province. The balance of the claim was deemed to be
uncollectable and was written off as a loss. 
 As of September 30, 2016, RMB
10,000,000 (US $ 1,499,390) is due and payable to the Company since the decision
from the lower court does not become effective until the appeal procedure is
completed or expired. In November 2015, the Supreme Court of Shandong Province
vacated the decision of the Linyi Court and remanded the case back to the Linyi
Court for a retrial. The retrial took place on April 25, 2016, at the Linyi City

   Landscaping, plants, and trees accounts
for the orchards that the Company has developed for agricultural operations.
These orchards as well as the young trees which were purchased as nursery stock
are capitalized into fixed assets. The depreciation is then calculated on a
30-year straight-line method when production in commercial quantities begins.
The orchards have begun production in small quantities and the Company has
accounted for depreciation commencing July 1, 2010. In 2013, the Company began
leasing three greenhouses to grow seasonal crops in order to lower cost. 
 Depreciation expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $ 1,848,602 and $2,014,035,
respectively.

month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $183,662 and $289,497,
respectively.  
 
 On August 8, 2015, the Company
re-organized its French operations by merging the operations of Conserverie
Minerve into its immediate parent Athena, and concurrently, Athena wound up and
dissolved Conserverie Minerve. Athena subsequently changed its own legal name to
Conservie Minerve and to continue its business. At the date of acquisition, the
net liability of Conserverie Minerve was $3,255,911(EUR 2,968,089); the purchase
consideration paid for the Athena (aka Conservie Minerve) was $2,100,000. The
acquisition of Athena and its then subsidiaries gave rise to goodwill in the
amount of $6,786,928. As of December 31, 2015, the surviving business entity,
Conserverie Minerve, on a post merged basis, recognized net operating losses
during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the
Company was unable to determine if the Conserverie Minerve would be able to
generate future profit and positive operating cash flows to justify the carrying
value of goodwill in the amount of $6,786,928; accordingly, the Company elected
to write off the goodwill in its entirety.

 The Company is negotiating with the
debenture holders to extend repayment terms.  
 
 Dating back to May 3, 2007, the Company
underwent a reverse-merger and a concurrent financing transaction that resulted
in 24,923,178 shares of outstanding common stock that remained unchanged through
December 31, 2007. In connection with the financing, the Company also issued
1,037,858 and 489,330 warrants to the PIPE investors and placement agent,
respectively. During 2008, several holders of warrants issued in connection with
the financing transaction exercised their rights to purchase shares at the
prescribed exercise price. The holders of the warrants exercised the right to
purchase a total of 360,207 shares; however, because the holders did not pay in
cash for the warrants, 110,752 of those shares were cancelled as consideration
in lieu of the warrant holders paying in cash. Ultimately, 249,455 of new shares
were issued to those who exercised their warrant. The Company also made an
adjustment to its outstanding share count for rounding errors as result of the
split and reverse splits made at the time of the reverse merger. The number of
shares in the adjustment was an addition of seven shares. The Company believes
the adjustment of seven shares is immaterial to both prior and current earnings
per share calculation. 
 During the year 2009, the Company
issued 56,393 shares of stock to its employees and vendors and 5,011,169 shares
to investors. The Company issued 1,334,573 stock options to employees on July
28, 2009; 1,753,909 shares of Series A warrants and 501,115 shares of Series B
warrants were issued to investors on October 28, 2009. As of December 31, 2015,
1,753,909 shares of Series A warrants had expired; concurrently, 501,115 shares
of Series B warrants and all stock options to employees from the 2009 stock
incentive program have expired.  
 During the year 2010, the Company
issued 2,000 shares to a service provider on February 10, 2010 and 81,155
warrants to various service providers on January 5, 2010. The Company issued to
investors 3,440,800 shares at an agreed price of $2.80 per share for a PIPE
financing on September 10, 2010. This financing brought $8,955,730 net proceeds
to the Company. The Company issued 5,000 shares to its employee on September 23,
2010. 731,707 shares of restricted stock were issued to the owner of Shandong
Greenpia, Mr. Ji Zhenwei on September 24, 2010 as part of acquisition cost. As
of December 31, 2015, 81,155 warrant shares issued to various service providers
has expired.  
 For the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014, the Company transferred $1,621,749 and $4,642,404 from retained
earnings to statutory reserve. These transfers are to be used for future company
development, recovery of losses and increase of capital, as approved, to expand
production or operations.  
 For the year ended December 31, 2014,
the Company issued 300,000 shares to a consulting company as its financial
advisor for management consulting and advisory services.  
 For the year ended December 31, 2015,

Exemption    
 
 The difference between the U.S. federal
statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate was as follows
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  
 
 Effective January 1, 2008, the PRC
government implemented a new 25% tax rate across the board for all enterprises
regardless of whether domestic or foreign enterprise without any tax holiday
which is defined as  two-year exemption followed by three-year half exemption 
hitherto enjoyed by tax payers. As a result of the standard 25% tax rate, tax
holidays were terminated as of December 31, 2007. However, PRC government has
established a set of transition rules to allow enterprises that were already
participating in tax holidays before January 1, 2008, to continue enjoying the
tax holidays until being fully utilized. 
 The Company has accrued a deferred tax
asset as a result of its net operating loss in as of and before December 31,
2015 because the Company planned to setup operations in the United States. The
company anticipates that the operations within the United States will generate
income in the future so that it will be able to take full advantage of the
accrued tax asset. Accordingly the Company has not provided a valuation
allowance for the accrued tax asset.

        SHARE BASED COMPENSATION     
 On July 27, 2009, the Company s Board
of Directors adopted the American Lorain Corporation 2009 Incentive Stock Plan
(the  Plan ). The Plan provides that the maximum number of shares of the
Company s common stock that may be issued under the Plan is 2,500,000 shares.
The Company s employees, directors, and service providers are eligible to
participate in the Plan. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2009,
the Company recorded a total of $166,346 of shared based compensation expense.
The Company issued warrants that upon exercise would result in the issuance of
1,334,573 common shares. These stock options vest over three years, where 33.33%
vest annually. The expense related to the stock options was $107,375. The
Company also recorded expense of $58,971 for the issuance of 56,393 common
shares to participants; these common shares vested immediately. Given the
materiality and nature of share based compensation, the entire expense has been
recorded as general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31,
2010, the Company recorded a total of $890,209 stock option and its related
general and administrative expenses.  
 On February 19, 2014 the Company s
board of directors approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ), which
was approved at the annual stockholders meeting on June 9, 2014. Subject to
adjustment as provided in the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of Common
Stock reserved and available for delivery in connection with awards under the
2014 Plan is 3,000,000. As of December 31, 2015, 987,500 shares were issued to employees as stock awards. The 2014 Plan replaces the
Company s 2009 Incentive Stock Plan (the  Prior Plan ) and no additional stock
awards shall be granted under the Prior Plan. All outstanding stock awards
granted under the Prior Plan shall remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plan
with respect to which they were originally granted.  
 No tax benefit has yet been accrued or
realized. For years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has yet to
repatriate its earnings. Accordingly it has not recognized any deferred tax
assets or liability in regards to benefits derived from the issuance of stock
options.  
 For the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not grant any stock options.

        CONTINGENCIES AND
LITIGATION     
 There is a lawsuit currently pending in
the Linyi City Intermediate People s Court of Shandong Province, which was
initially filed by Shandong Lorain, a subsidiary of the Company, against Junan
Hengji Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. ("Junan Hengji") in November 2013 at
Linyi City Intermediate People's Court of Shandong Province (the "Linyi Court").
Shandong Lorain added Jiangsu Hengan Industrial Investment Group Co., Ltd.
("Heng An Investment") as a co-defendant after the case was first filed at the
Linyi Court. 
 In September 2010, Shandong Lorain and
Junan Hengji entered into a cooperative development agreement (the "Agreement")
and in March 2011, Heng An Investment, an affiliated company of Junan Hengji,
also entered into the Agreement with Shandong Lorain to jointly develop the
project with Junan Hengji. Pursuant to the Agreement, Junan Henji and Heng An
Investment are required to pay Shandong Lorain a total of RMB 20 million
(approximately $3,225,806) fixed return according to the development status of
the project developed by Junan Hengji and Heng An Investment. The payment was
due but unpaid in [Month/Year]. In deciding to bring suit, Shandong Lorain and
the Company evaluated the potential claims against Junan Hengji and Heng An
Investment, disputes between the parties with respect to out-of-pocket expenses
paid by Junan Hengji, as well as the litigation fee that is required to be paid
to the court based upon the amount claimed. Ultimately, Shandong Lorain decided
to file the lawsuit with Linyi Court to claim a fixed return of RMB 10 million
(approximately $1,499,390).  
 In January 2014, the Linyi Court held
its first trial session. During the trial, Heng An Investment filed a
counterclaim against Shandong Lorain for repayment of out-of-pocket expenses
which would offset the entire fixed return plus additional unpaid expenses of
RMB 4,746,927 (approximately $765,633). Shandong Lorain responded that Heng An
Investment does not have standing to file the counter-claim because the
out-of-pocket payments were made by Junan Hengji. In November 2014, the court
held a second trial session and completed its discovery process. On March 21,
2015, Shandong Lorain received the Linyi Court's decision that rejected Shandong
Lorain's claim for RMB 10,000,000 against Junan Hengji and Heng An Investment.
On April 3, 2015, Shandong Lorain appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of
Shandong Province. 
 In November 2015, the Supreme Court of
Shandong Province vacated the decision of the Linyi Court and remanded the case
back to the Linyi Court for a retrial. The retrial took place on April 25, 2016,
at the Linyi City Intermediate People s Court, and the decision thereon is
currently pending. The Company is confident that Shandong Lorain will prevail on
retrial.

      subject to minimal risk borne from credit extended to customers.   

B.

The company is subject to interest rate risk when short
      term loans become due and require refinancing.   

C.  
     
        Economic and political risks    

The Company s operations are conducted in the PRC.
      Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition, and results of
      operations may be influenced by changes in the political, economic, and
      legal environments in the PRC.   

The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to
      special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
      companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks
      associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal
      environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be
      adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in
      the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and
      regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances
      abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.   

D.  
     
        Environmental risks    

The Company has procured environmental licenses required

        Inflation Risk    

Management monitors changes in prices levels.
      Historically inflation has not materially impacted the company s financial
      statements; however, significant increases in the price of raw materials
      and labor that cannot be passed on the Company s customers could adversely
      impact the Company s results of operations.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Overview   
 We are an integrated food manufacturing company headquartered
in Shandong Province, China. We develop, manufacture and sell the following
types of food products:  

Chestnut products;   

Convenience foods (including ready-to-cook, or
      RTC, foods, ready-to-eat, or RTE, foods and meals ready- to-eat, or MRE);
      and   

Frozen food products.    
 We conduct our production activities mainly in China. Our
products are sold in Chinese domestic markets as well as exported to foreign
countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea and Europe. We derive most of
our revenues from sales in China, Japan and South Korea. In 2016, our primary
strategy is to continue building our brand recognition in China through
consistent marketing efforts towards supermarkets, wholesalers, and significant
customers, enhancing the cooperation with other manufacturers and factories and
enhancing the turnover for our existing chestnut, convenience and frozen food
products. In addition, we are working to expand our marketing efforts in Asia
and Europe. We currently have limited sales and marketing activity in the United
States, although our long-term plan is to significantly expand our activities
there.  
 Revenue achieved in the third quarter of 2016 is $40.8 million,
which decreased $6.9 million compared to the same period of 2015. Domestic sales
in the third quarter of 2016 decreased $1.9 million as compared to same period
of last year. Revenue from three product segments all experienced decline. In
the coming quarters, American Lorain anticipates that domestic market demand for
its traditional chestnut product line will increase. Outside China, sales
decreased $5.0 million compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease is
mainly due to a decrease in our revenue from Europe as a result of questions
raised by CTCPA regarding the origin of canned chestnuts sold by Conserverie
Minerve in potential contravention of CTCPA policies.

Production Factors that Affect our Financial and
Operating Condition    
 Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various
agricultural products, including chestnuts, vegetables, fruits, red meat, fish,
eggs, rice, flour and packaging products. During the third quarter of 2016, the
cost of our raw materials and external purchased finished goods decreased from
$30.0 million to $28.2 million, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, for a
decrease of approximately 6.0%. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease of
total cost of sales. Cost of raw materials and external purchased
finished goods normally accounts for over 81.9% of total cost of revenue, which
fluctuates with the market supply conditions. We may have to increase the number
of our suppliers of raw materials and expand our own agricultural operations in
the future to meet growing production demands. Despite our efforts to control
our supply of raw materials and maintain good relationships with our suppliers,
we could lose one or more of our suppliers at any time. 
 The loss of several suppliers may be difficult to replace and
could increase our reliance on higher cost or lower quality suppliers, which
could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, if we have to increase
the number of our suppliers of raw materials in the future to meet growing
production demands, we may not be able to locate new suppliers who can provide
us with sufficient materials to meet our needs. Any interruptions to, or decline
in, the amount or quality of our raw materials supply could materially disrupt
our production and adversely affect our business and financial condition and
financial prospects.  
   Seasonality    
 Chestnut season in China lasts from September to January. We
purchase and process raw chestnuts during these months and store them in our
refrigerated storage facilities throughout the year. Once we obtain a purchase
order during the rest of the year, we remove the chestnuts from storage, further
process them and ship them within one day of production. Since most chestnuts
are produced and sold in the fourth quarter, the Company generally performs best
in the fourth quarter.  
   Uncertainties that Affect our Financial Condition
   
 We spend a significant amount of cash on our operations,
principally to procure raw materials for our products. Many of our suppliers,
including chestnut, vegetable and fruit farmers, and suppliers of packaging
materials, require us to prepay for their supplies in cash or pay on the same
day that such supplies are delivered to us. However, some of the suppliers with
whom we have a long-standing business relationship allow us to pay on credit. We
fund the majority of our working capital requirements out of cash flow generated
from operations. If we fail to generate sufficient sales, or if our suppliers stop offering us credit
terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operating costs and our
business could be adversely affected.  
 We funded approximately 30.0% of our working capital from the
proceeds of short-term loans from Chinese and overseas banks in the third
quarter of 2016, as compared to 40.0% over the same period last year. We expect
to continue to fund our working capital requirements with such loans in the
future. Such loans are generally secured by our fixed assets, receivables and
guarantees by third parties. Our balance of short-term bank loans as of
September 30, 2016 was approximately $30.3 million. The term of almost all such
loans is one year or less. Historically, we have rolled over such loans on an
annual basis. However, commencing in 2010, the Chinese government began
implementing more stringent credit policies to curb inflation and soaring
property prices. These policies could negatively impact our ability to
obtain or roll over these short term loans, and hence our possession of
sufficient available funds to pay all of our borrowings upon maturity. Failure
to roll over our short-term borrowings at maturity or to service our debt could
result in the imposition of penalties, including increases in rates of interest,
legal actions against us by our creditors, or even insolvency. We can provide no
assurances that we will be able to enter into any future financing or
refinancing agreements on terms favorable to us, especially considering the
current instability of the capital markets.  
 35 

We anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash
flows from operations and current and expected short-term bank loans will be
adequate to satisfy our liquidity requirements for 2017. However, if available
liquidity is not sufficient to meet our operating and loan obligations as they
come due, our plans include obtaining alternative financing arrangements or
further reducing expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements.
There is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to raise
additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required
liquidity. Currently, the capital markets for small capitalization companies are
extremely difficult and banking institutions have become stringent in their
lending requirements. Accordingly, we cannot be sure of the availability or
terms of any third party financing. 
 Our business, operating results or financial condition will be
adversely affected in the event of unfavorable economic conditions, including
the ongoing global economy and capital markets disruptions. For example, we may
experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows as a result of
reduced orders, delays in receiving orders, delays or defaults in payment or
other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and prospective
customers. We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems
associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors.
In addition, changes and volatility in the equity, credit and foreign exchange
markets and in the competitive landscape make it increasingly difficult for us
to predict our revenues and earnings into the future. 
  Results of Operations   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 The following table summarizes the results of our operations
during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage
increase or (decrease) from the three month period ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  
  (All amounts, other than percentages, stated in U.S. dollar)

36 

Net Revenues      
 Our net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016
amounted to $40.8 million, which represents a decrease of approximately $6.9
million, or 14.4%, from the three month period ended on September 30, 2015, in
which our revenue was $47.7 million. The overall decrease was attributable to
the decrease in sales of all of our product segments, as reflected in the
following table:  
 
   Cost of Revenues      
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we
experienced a decrease in cost of revenue of $4.9 million, in comparison to the
three months ended September 30, 2015, from approximately $39.4 million to $34.5
million, reflecting a decrease of approximately 12.5% .The decrease of cost of
revenues is mainly due to the decline of net revenues.  
   Gross Profit    
 Our gross profit decreased $2.0 million, or 23.7%, to $6.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $8.3 million for the
same period in 2015 as a result of decreases of net revenue and cost of goods
sold. Our gross margins decreased from 17.4% to 15.5% mainly due to the  decrease of
revenues from chestnuts products, which normally generated higher gross
margin. 
   Operating Expenses      
  Selling and Marketing Expenses . Our selling and
marketing expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 35.2%, to $1.2 million in the
third quarter of 2016 from $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2015. The
overall decrease was mainly due to the decrease of shipping and port costs from
$0.4 million during the three months ending September 30, 2015 to $0.01 million
in current reporting period.  

 The selling and marketing expense to revenue ratio for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 3.0% and 4.0%, respectively.
Management actively worked to control sales related expenses in accordance with
market and sales conditions.  
 37  

General and Administrative Expenses    
 We experienced a decrease in general and administrative expenses
of $1.3 million from approximately $2.4 million to approximately $1.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in
2015. The decrease was mainly due to the deconsolidation of Minerve as Minerve
went into the bankruptcy liquidation process during the three months ended
September 30, 2015. General and
administrative expenses of Minerve were $0.9 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. In addition, as our revenues decreased, we further strictly
control our expenses incurred. 
   Income Before Taxation and Non-controlling
Interest    
 Income before taxation and non-controlling interest decreased $1.6
million, or 56.3%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $2.8 million for the same period of 2015. The decrease was mainly
attributable to the decrease of our net revenue and gross margin for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015.  
   Income Taxes    
 Income taxes decreased $0.3 million or 29.0%, to $0.7 million
in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $1.0 million in the third quarter
of 2015, primarily attributable to the decrease of earnings before tax.  
   Net Income    
 Net income decreased $1.3 million, or 70.4%, to $0.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million for the same
period of 2015. The decrease was attributable to decrease of net revenue and
gross profit in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015  
 The following table summarizes the results of our operations
during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage
increase or (decrease) from the nine month period ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
  (All amounts, other than percentages, stated in U.S. dollar)

38 

Net Revenues    
 Our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
amounted to $104.6 million, which represents a decrease of approximately $16.2
million, or 13.4%, from the nine month period ended on September 30, 2015, in
which our net revenue was $120.8 million. The overall decrease was attributable to
the decrease in sales of certain product segments, as reflected in the
following table:  
 
   Cost of Revenues    
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced
a decrease in cost of revenue of $14.7 million, in comparison to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, from approximately $101.1 million to $86.4 million,
reflecting a decrease of approximately 14.5% . The decrease in cost of revenue
is mainly attributable to the decrease of net revenues.  
   Gross Profit    
 Our gross profit decreased $1.6 million, or 8.0%, to $18.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $19.7 million for the
same period in 2015 as a result of decrease of net revenues. Our gross margins
increased from 16.3% to 17.4% . The increase is mainly due to the fact that the
percentage of chestnut products in sales increased from 44.5% to 52.1%, whose

gross margin is higher than that of convenience food and frozen food. 
   Operating Expenses      
  Selling and Marketing Expenses . Our selling and
marketing expenses decreased $0.2 million during the nine months ending
September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period last year. The overall
decrease was mainly due to the decrease of shipping and port costs from $0.8
million during the nine months ending September 30, 2015 to $0.2 million in
current reporting period.  
 The selling and marketing expense to revenue ratio for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively.
Management believes that the expense was reasonably incurred as revenue
increased compared to the same period of last year. 
 39  

General and Administrative Expenses    
 We experienced a decrease in general and administrative expense
of $6.2 million from approximately $9.5 million to approximately $3.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in
2015. The decrease was mainly due to the deconsolidation of Minerve as Minerve
went into the bankruptcy liquidation process during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  General and
administrative expense of Minerve were $3.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. In addition, the Company issued 987,500 shares as stock
compensation to employees and directors during nine months ended September 30,
2015, for which we recorded expense amounting to $1.3 million. 
   Income Before Taxation and Non-controlling
Interest   
 Income before taxation and non-controlling interest decreased
$1.6 million, or 98.4%, to $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 from $1.7 million for the same period of 2015. Although general and
administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
$6.2 million compared to the same period of 2015, we recognized a $4.6 million
loss for our investments in French and Portugal subsidiaries due to our loss in
control of Minerve.  
   Income Taxes    
 Income taxes remained stable in the nine months ended 2016 as
compared to the same period of 2015.  
   Net Loss    
 Net loss increased $1.6 million, or 278.2%, to $2.2 million

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.6 million for the same
period of 2015. The decrease was attributable to the recognition of a $4.6
million loss for our investments in French and Portugal subsidiaries.  
   Liquidity and Capital Resources    

 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents
(including restricted cash) of $40.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents
increased by approximately $8.1 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to
cash provided by financing activities and investment activities, partially
offset by cash used in operating activities. The following table provides
detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods
presented in this report.  
  Cash Flow (in thousands)   
 
 40 

Operating Activities   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $13.3 million for the
nine months period ended September 30, 2016, and net cash provided by operating
activities was $26.0 million for the nine months period ended September 30,
2015. The decrease of approximately $39.3 million in net cash flows in the first
three quarters of 2016 was due primarily to the decrease of accounts and other
payables of $27.2 million. 
  Investing Activities   
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months
period ended September 30, 2016 was $14.6 million, representing an increase of
$27.7 million from $13.1 million net cash used for the same period of 2015. The
difference was primarily a result of increase in restricted cash of $19.2
million.  
  Financing Activities   
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
period ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million, representing an increase of
$13.7 million from $12.5 million net cash used in financing activities during
the same period in 2015. The increase of net cash from financing activities was
primarily a result of less repayment of long term borrowing and notes
payable.. 
  Loan Facilities   
 As of September 30, 2016, the amounts and maturity dates for
our short-term bank loans are as set forth in the Notes to the Financial
Statements. The total amounts outstanding were $30.3 million as of September 30,
2016, compared with $36.3 million as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our
currently available working capital and the further proceeds of the credit
facilities, should be adequate to sustain our operations at our current levels
through at least the next twelve months.  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in
our financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures
of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting
policies to be those that require significant judgments and estimates in the
preparation of financial statements, including the following:  
  Method of Accounting  We maintain the general ledger and
journals with the accrual method accounting for financial reporting purposes.
The financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting
policies adopted by the Company conform to generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the presentation
of financial statements, which are compiled on the accrual basis of
accounting. 
  Use of estimates  The preparation of the financial
  statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
  United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
  contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
  Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the
  time the estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. 
 41 

Principles of consolidation  Our consolidated financial
statements, which include information about our company and our subsidiaries,
are compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America. All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements include
100% of assets, liabilities, and net income or loss of those wholly-owned
subsidiaries; ownership interests of non-controlling investors are recorded as
non-controlling interests.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the detailed identities of the
consolidating subsidiaries are as follows: 
 
  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  --
The long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets
may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become
impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Determination of
recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount
of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the
assets. 
 If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
 
 During the reporting period, there was no impairment loss. 
  Revenue recognition --  The Company's revenue recognition
policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales
revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal
arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is
completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the
relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned
revenue.  
 The Company's revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net
of a value-added tax (VAT). The Company allows its customers to return products
if they are defective. However, this rarely happens and amounts returned have
been de minimis.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Financial
Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities , which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the
classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU
retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s
accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in
equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for
financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain
disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. 
 On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases
(Topic 842) , its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 introduces
a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard
also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those
in ASC 606, the FASB s new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to
evaluating when profit can be recognized). 
 Furthermore, the ASU addresses other concerns related to the
current leases model. For example, the ASU eliminates the requirement in current
U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease
classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency
of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they
manage that exposure. The new model represents a wholesale change to lease
accounting. As a result, entities will face significant implementation
challenges during the transition period and beyond, such as those related
to: 

Applying judgment and estimating.    

Managing the complexities of data collection, storage,
      and maintenance.    

Enhancing information technology systems to ensure their
      ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with
      reporting requirements.    

Refining internal controls and other business processes
      related to leases.    

Determining whether debt covenants are likely to be
      affected and, if so, working with lenders to avoid violations.    

Addressing any income tax implications.
    
 The new guidance will be effective for public business entities
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (e.g., calendar periods
beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods therein. 
 On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07
 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the
Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which simplifies the equity
method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the
equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting
as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity method (as
a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
influence), the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would
be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the
equity method would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor
obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. The ASU
further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income related to an available-for-sale security that becomes
eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which
the investment qualifies for the equity method.  
 The guidance in the ASU is effective for all entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all entities. Entities are
required to apply the guidance prospectively to increases in the level of
ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU s effective
date. Additional transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.  
 On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which amends the principal-versus-agent
implementation guidance and illustrations in the Board s new revenue standard
(ASU 2014-09). The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by
stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of
account under the revenue standard s principal-versus-agent guidance and (2)
applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in
accordance with the revenue standard s control principle. Among other things,
the ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or
the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a
customer. As defined in the ASU, a specified good or service is  a distinct good
or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the
customer.  Therefore, for contracts involving more than one specified good or
service, the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods or
services and the agent for others.  

The ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard
(as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions in ASU
2015-14). In addition, entities are required to adopt the ASU by using the same
transition method they used to adopt the new revenue standard.  
 On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and
nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the
statement of cash flows. 
 The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting
periods.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there are no other recently issued
accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could have a material effect
on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We do not have any off-balance arrangements.  
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK   
 Not required.  
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of
September 30, 2016, and as of the date that the evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures was completed, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective due to the continuing material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting.  
 43 

The material weakness and significant deficiency identified by
our management as of September 30, 2016 relates to the ability of the Company to
record transactions and provide disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We did
not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level
of experience in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial
reporting requirements. For example, our staff members do not hold licenses such
as Certified Public Accountant or Certified Management Accountant in the U.S.,
have not attended U.S. institutions for training as accountants, and have not
attended extended educational programs that would provide sufficient relevant
education relating to U.S. GAAP. Our staff will require substantial training to
meet the demands of a U.S. public company and our staff s understanding of the
requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting is inadequate.  
 We plan to provide U.S. GAAP training sessions to our
  accounting team. The training sessions will be organized to help our corporate
  accounting team gain experience in U.S. GAAP reporting and to enhance their
  awareness of new and emerging pronouncements with potential impact over our
  financial reporting. We plan to continue to recruit experienced and professional
  accounting and financial personnel and participate in educational seminars,
  tutorials, and conferences and employ more qualified accounting staff in
  future. 
 C hanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation performed during the period covered by this
report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 There is a lawsuit currently pending in the Linyi City
Intermediate People s Court of Shandong Province (the  Linyi Court ), which was
initially filed by Shandong Lorain, a subsidiary of the Company, against Junan
Hengji Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. ("Junan Hengji") in November 2013.
Shandong Lorain added Jiangsu Hengan Industrial Investment Group Co., Ltd.
("Heng An Investment") as a co-defendant after the case was first filed at the
Linyi Court. 
 In September 2010, Shandong Lorain and Junan Hengji entered
into a cooperative development agreement (the "Agreement") and in March 2011,
Heng An Investment, an affiliated company of Junan Hengji, also entered into the
Agreement with Shandong Lorain to jointly develop the project with Junan Hengji.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Junan Henji and Heng An Investment are required to
pay Shandong Lorain a total of RMB 20 million (approximately $3,225,806) fixed
return according to the development status of the project developed by Junan
Hengji and Heng An Investment. In deciding to bring suit, Shandong Lorain and
the Company evaluated the potential claims against Junan Hengji and Heng An
Investment, disputes between the parties with respect to out-of-pocket expenses
paid by Junan Hengji, as well as the litigation fee that is required to be paid
to the court based upon the amount claimed. Ultimately, Shandong Lorain decided to file
the lawsuit with Linyi Court to claim a fixed return of RMB 10 million
(approximately $1,540,666).  
 44 

In January 2014, the Linyi Court held its first trial session.
During the trial, Heng An Investment filed a counterclaim against Shandong
Lorain for repayment of out-of-pocket expenses which would offset the entire
fixed return plus additional unpaid expenses of RMB 4,746,927 (approximately
$765,633). Shandong Lorain responded that Heng An Investment did not have
standing to file the counter-claim because the out-of-pocket payments were made
by Junan Hengji. In November 2014, the court held a second trial session and
completed its discovery process. On March 21, 2015, Shandong Lorain received the
Linyi Court's decision that rejected Shandong Lorain's claim for RMB 10,000,000
against Junan Hengji and Heng An Investment. On April 3, 2015, Shandong Lorain
appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Shandong Province. 
 In November 2015, the Supreme Court of Shandong Province
  vacated the decision of the Linyi Court and remanded the case back to the Linyi
  Court for a retrial. The retrial took place on April 25, 2016, at the Linyi City
  Intermediate People s Court, and the decision thereon is currently pending. The
Company is confident that Shandong Lorain will prevail on retrial.
