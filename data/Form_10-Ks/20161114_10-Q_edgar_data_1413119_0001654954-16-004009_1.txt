NOTE 1    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION 

(A)  Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in The United States of America and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim
financial information.  Accordingly, they do not include
all the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of
financial position and results of operations. 

It is management's opinion, however that all material adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which
are necessary for a fair financial statements
presentation.  The results for the interim period are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
year. 

Kraig
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. The Company was
organized to develop high strength, protein based fiber, using
recombinant DNA technology, for commercial applications in the
textile and specialty fiber industries. 

(B) Use of Estimates 

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

(C) Cash 

For
purposes of the cash flow statements, the Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.  There were no cash equivalents as of
September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

(D) Loss Per Share 

Basic
and diluted net loss per common share is computed based upon the
weighted average common shares outstanding as defined by FASB
Accounting Standards Codification No. 260,  Earnings per
Share.   During the nine month periods ended 
September 30, 2016 and 2015, warrants were not included in the
computation of income/ (loss) per share because their inclusion is
anti-dilutive. 

The
computation of basic and diluted loss per share during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes the common stock
equivalents of the following potentially dilutive securities
because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: 

(E) Research and Development Costs 

The
Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred for
which there is no alternative future use. These costs also include
the expensing of employee compensation and employee stock based
compensation. 

(F) Income Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic
740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ).  Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. 

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Effective
January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance regarding accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes. This guidance clarifies the
accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements and applies to all federal
or state income tax positions. Each income tax position is assessed
using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to
whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position
will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by
the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to
meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the
financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than
50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were no amounts that
had been accrued in respect to uncertain tax
positions. 

The
Company s federal income tax returns, for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2013, is currently under examination by the
Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ); and all returns from
fiscal 2009 through today remain subject to examination by the IRS
and respective states. 

(G) Derivative Financial Instruments 

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative
instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or
equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value for
accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing
the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the
convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt
and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring
measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional
convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process
of these instruments as derivative financial
instruments. 

Once
determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair
value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an
adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair
value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are
also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. 

(H) Stock-Based Compensation 

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards
Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock
Compensation .  Under FASB Accounting Standards
Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the
compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based
on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the
financial statements over the period during which employees are
required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements
include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based
awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase
plans.  As such, compensation cost is measured on the
date of grant at their fair value.  Such compensation
amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods
of the option grant.  The Company applies this statement
prospectively. 

Equity
instruments ( instruments ) issued to other than
employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the
instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification
No. 718.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification No.
505,  Equity Based Payments to
Non-Employees  defines the measurement date and
recognition period for such instruments.  In general, the
measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as
defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee
performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The
measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a
period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular
grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. 

(I) Business Segments 

The
Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information
is not presented. 

(J)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In
September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business
Combinations (Topic 805) ( ASU 2015-16 ). Topic 805
requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional
amounts recognized in a business combination, during the
measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made
to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that
the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are
identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required
to also record, in the same period s financial statements,
the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or
other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the
provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is
required to present separately on the face of the income statement
or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of
the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that
would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the
adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the
acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years
beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. 

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 

In
August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date ( ASU 2015-14 ). The amendment in this ASU defers
the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one
year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities,
and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU
2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim
reporting periods with that reporting period. 

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which
changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial
statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt
liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will
continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied
retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is
currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of
ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets. 

All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective
have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 

(K)
Reclassification  

The
2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
2016 presentation. 

(L) Equipment 

The
Company values property and equipment at cost and depreciates these
assets using the straight-line method over their expected useful
life. The Company uses a five year life for
automobiles. 

In
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No.
360,  Property, Plant and
Equipment , the Company carries long-lived assets at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Impairment is evaluated
by estimating future undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum
of the expected undiscounted future cash flow is less than the
carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized.
Fair value, for purposes of calculating impairment, is measured
based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at a market rate
of interest. 

There
were no impairment losses recorded during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

(M) Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

We hold
certain financial assets, which are required to be measured at fair
value on a recurring basis in accordance with the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 157,   Fair Value Measurements  
( ASC Topic 820-10 ).   ASC Topic 820-10
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurements).  ASC Topic 820-10 defines fair value as
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants on the measurement date. Level 1 instruments include
cash, account receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory and account
payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying values are assumed to
approximate the fair value due to the short term nature of the
instrument. 

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820-10 are
described below: 

Level 1
- Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to
access.  We believe our carrying value of level 1
instruments approximate their fair value at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. 

Level 2
- Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or
can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3
- Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets or liabilities. We consider depleting assets, asset
retirement obligations and net profit interest liability to be
Level 3. We determine the fair value of Level 3
assets and liabilities utilizing various inputs, including NYMEX
price quotations and contract terms.

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 

(N) Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenues are generated primarily from contracts
with the U.S. Government. The Company performs work under the
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. 

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts Revenue is recognized on
cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts with the U.S. Government on the basis
of partial performance equal to costs incurred plus an estimate of
applicable fees earned as the Company becomes contractually
entitled to reimbursement of costs and the applicable
fees  . 
Invoicing for costs and applicable fees are reported to the U.S.
Government on a monthly basis and invoices are typically paid
within 30 days.   

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized $18,673 in revenue from the Government
contract. 

( O)
Concentration of Credit Risk 

The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance
limits. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had approximately $85,909 and $0, respectively in excess of FDIC
insurance limits. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a
concentration of accounts receivable of: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, the Company had a concentration of sales of: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, the Company had a concentration of sales of: 

NOTE 2     GOING CONCERN  

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the
Company has a working capital deficiency of $2,321,080 and
stockholders  deficiency of $2,265,117 and used $824,791 of
cash in operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  This raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s
ability to raise additional capital and implement its business
plan.  The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional
funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3 EQUIPMENT 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, property and equipment,

Overview 

Kraig
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. is a corporation organized under the
laws of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. We were organized to develop
high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology, for
commercial applications in both the specialty fiber and technical
textile industries. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific
uses that require exceptional strength, flexibility, heat
resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market
is exemplified by two synthetic fiber products: aramid fibers and
ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber. The technical
textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer
products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles (e.g.,
sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing
and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications (e.g.,
high-strength composite materials). 

We are
using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with
greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target
markets, namely the textile, specialty fiber and technical textile
industries. 

The
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our
financial statements as of December 31, 2015 include an explanatory
paragraph stating that  our
net loss from operations and net capital deficiency  at
December 31, 2015 raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Plan of Operations 

During
the next twelve months, we expect to take the following steps in
connection with the further development of our business and the
implementation of our plan of operations:  

We have
spent approximately $379,815 between January 2016 and September
2016 on collaborative research and development of high strength
polymers at the University of Notre Dame. We expect to spend
approximately $105,000 between October 2016 and December 2016 on
collaborative research and development of high strength polymers at
the University of Notre Dame. With this funding we plan to
accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs as
well as providing more resources for our material testing
protocols.  If our financing allows, management will give
strong consideration to accelerating the pace of spending on
research and development within the University of Notre
Dame s laboratories.  

We
expect to spend approximately $13,700 on collaborative research and
development of high strength polymers and spider silk protein at
the University of Wyoming over the next twelve months. This level
of research spending at the university is also a requirement of our
licensing agreement with the university. If our financing will
allow, management will give strong consideration to accelerating
the pace of spending on research and development within the
University of Wyoming s laboratories. 

We will
actively consider pursuing collaborative research opportunities
with other university laboratories in the area of high strength
polymers. If our financing allows, management will give strong
consideration to increasing the depth of our research to include
polymer production technologies that are closely related to our
core research. 

20 

We will
consider buying an established revenue producing company in a
compatible business, in order to broaden our financial base and
facilitate the commercialization of our products. We expect to use
a combination of stock and cash for any such purchase. 

We will
also actively consider pursuing collaborative research
opportunities with both private and university laboratories in
areas of research which overlap the company s existing
research and development. One such potential area for collaborative
research which the company is considering is protein expression
platforms. If our financing allows, management will give strong
consideration to increasing the breadth of our research to include
protein expression platform technologies. 

We plan
to actively pursue collaborative research and product testing,
opportunities with companies in the biotechnology, materials,
textile and other industries. 

We plan
to actively pursue collaborative commercialization, marketing and
manufacturing opportunities with companies in the textile and
material sectors for the fibers we developed and for any new
polymers that we create in 2016. 

We plan
to actively pursue the development of commercial scale production
of our recombinant materials including Monster Silk    and Dragon
SilkTM 

We have
not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our
business through an increased investment in our research and
development efforts. We cannot guarantee that the research and
development efforts described in this filing will be successful.
Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise,
including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research
and development process and possible rejection of our products in
development. 

If
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable
to continue expanding our operations. Equity financing will result
in a dilution to existing shareholders. 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three months
ended September 30, 2015 

Our
revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, were as follows
  some balances on the prior period s combined
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation: 

Net Revenues :  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we realized $18,673 of
revenues from our business. During the three months ended September
30, 2015, we realized $0 of revenues from our business. The change
in revenues between the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $18,673 or 100%. 

Cost of
Revenues :  Costs of revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $0, as compared to $0 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $0 or 0%.

Research and development
expenses:   During the three months ended September
30, 2016 we incurred $129,282 research and development
expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we
incurred $90,650 of research and development expenses, a decrease
of $38,632 or 42.62% compared with the same period in 2016. The
research and development expenses are attributable to the research
and development with the Notre Dame University; this increase was
due to the timing of research related activity and related charges
and the hiring of an additional lab team member. 

21 

Professional
Fees:   During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we incurred $29,060 professional expenses, which decreased by
$53,371 or (64.75 %) from $82,431 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in professional fees expense
was attributable to decreased expenses related to intellectual
property protection of the research and development activities
during the three months ended September 30. 2016. 

Officers
Salary:   During the three months ended September
30, 2016, officers  salary expenses increased to $127,809 or
34.91% from $94,735 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in officer s salary expenses was
attributable to the hiring of a Chief Operations Officer in late
January of 2015. 

General and Administrative
Expense : General and administrative expenses increased by
$766,661 or 1394.18% to $821,651 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $54,990 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Our general and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of

primary reason for the increase in comparing the three months ended
September 30, 2016 to the corresponding period for 2015 was mainly
due to general business expenses. 

Interest
Expense :  Interest expense increased by $9,630 to
$35,339 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from
$25,709 for the three month period ended September 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to interest on the
loans. 

Net Loss :  Net loss
increased by $775,953, or 222.65%, to a net loss of $1,124,468 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of
$348,515 for the three month period ended September 30,
2015. This increase in net loss was driven primarily by
increases in research and development and professional
fees. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

Our
revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine
month period ended September 30, 2015, were as follows   some
balances on the prior period s combined financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation: 

Net Revenues :  During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we realized $18,673 of
revenues from our business. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, we realized $0 of revenues from our business. The change
in revenues between the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $18,673 or 100%. 

Cost of
Revenues :  Costs of revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $0, as compared to $0 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $0 or 0%. 

Gross Profit : During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we realized a gross profit of
$18,673, as compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, a change of $18,673 or 100%. 

Research and development
expenses:   During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 we incurred $379,815 research and development
expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we
incurred $313,739 of research and development expenses, an increase
of $66,076 or 21.06% compared with the same period in 2016. The
research and development expenses are attributable to the research
and development with the Notre Dame University; this increase was
due to the timing of research related activity and related charges
and the hiring of an additional lab team member. 

22 

Professional
Fees:   During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we incurred $319,309 professional expenses, which increased
by $97,457 or 43.93% from $221,852 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in professional fees expense
was attributable to increased expenses related to intellectual
property protection of the research and development activities
during the nine months ended September 30. 2016. 

Officers
Salary:   During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, officers  salary expenses increased to $340,999 or
21.73% from $280,127 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in officer s salary expenses was
attributable to the hiring of a Chief Operations Officer in late
January of 2015. 

General and Administrative
Expense : General and administrative expenses increased by
$191,807 or 22.45% to $1,046,324 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $854,517 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Our general and administrative expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of
consulting fees of $16,655 and other general and administrative
expenses (which includes expenses such as Auto, Business
Development, SEC Filing, Investor Relations, General Office,
warrant Compensation) of $1,022,333, Travel of $1,377, office
salary of $5,959 for a total of $1,046,324. Our general and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 consisted of salaries and benefits of $3,570, consulting fees
of $18,000, and other general and administrative expenses (which
includes expenses such as: Auto, Business Development, SEC Filing,
Investor Relations, General Office, warrant Compensation of
$816,423, and travel of $16,524 for a total of $854,517. The
primary reason for the decrease in comparing the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 to the corresponding period for 2015 was mainly
due to general business expenses. 

Interest
Expense :  Interest expense increased by $28,007 to
$99,442 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 from
$71,435 for the nine month period ended September 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to interest on the
loans. 

Net Loss :  Net loss
increased by $428,568, or 24.739%, to a net loss of $2,161,512 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of
$1,732,944 for the nine month period ended September 30,
2015. This increase in net loss was driven primarily by
increases in research and development, warrant compensation and
professional fees. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Management Plans 

Our
condensed financial statements have been presented on the basis
that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. As presented in the financial statements, we
incurred a net loss of $2,161,512 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and losses are expected to continue in the near
term. The accumulated deficit is $22,473,648 at September 30,
2016. Refer to Note 5 for our discussion of stockholder
deficit. We have been funding our operations through private
loans and the sale of common stock in private placement
transactions. Refer to Note 4 and Note 5 in the condensed
financial statements for our discussion of notes payable and shares
issued, respectively. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet
our planned business objectives without additional
financing. These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our
company to continue as a going concern. 

Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be
necessary to develop and expand our business before significant
positive operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise
additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues
and profitable operations. At September 30, 2016, we had
$335,909 of cash on hand. These funds are insufficient to
complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to
seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt or
equity securities for cash to operate our business. No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may
contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt
financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in
case or equity financing. 

Management has
undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the
goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and
beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital
and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses;
and (c) executing material sales or research contracts. There
can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish
these steps and it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a
profitable level of operations and obtain additional
financing. There can be no assurance that any additional
financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms
and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this Report, we
have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the
above. 

In the
event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the
Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its
creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be
subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date,
management has not considered this alternative, nor does management
view it as a likely occurrence. 

Presently, due to
the lack of revenues and profitability we are not able to meet our
operating and capital expenses. The success of our ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional
capital and/or financing, of which there can be no guarantee, and
maintaining a break even or profitable level of operations. We have
incurred operating losses since inception, and this is likely to
continue in the near future. 

23 

The
financial requirements of our Company will be dependent upon the
financial support through credit facilities and additional sales of
our equity securities. There can be no assurance, however,
that such financing will be available or, if it is available, that
we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to
us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements
until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive
cash flows. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to
support our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going
concern. We currently have no firm commitments for any additional
capital. 

The
downturn in the United States stock and debt markets could make it
more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity
or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds
required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and
expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or
experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek
alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or
debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or
the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or
privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares of
common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject to
restrictive covenants. Even if we are able to raise the funds
required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and
expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or
experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek
additional financing. If additional financing is not available
or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail
our operations. 

Cash,
total current assets, total assets, total current liabilities and
total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December
31, 2015, were as follows: 

At September
30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $2,321,080, compared
to a working capital deficit of $1,963,040 at December 31,
2015. Current liabilities increased to $2,677,513 at September
30, 2016 from $2,201,873 at December 31, 2015, primarily as a
result of accounts payable and accrued compensation. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operations
of $824,791 was the result of a net loss of $2,161,512 offset by
depreciation expense of $12,639, loss on forgiveness of debt of
$5,704, warrants issued to related parties of $215,880, increase in
prepaid expenses of $1,216, an increase of accrued expenses and
other payables-related party of $375,893 and an increase in
accounts payable of $44,338. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, net cash used in operations of $685,099 was the
result of a net loss of $1,732,944 offset by depreciation expense
of $11,175, gain on forgiveness of debt of $9,679, loss on disposal
of fixed assets of $953, warrants issued to related parties of
$100,618, warrants issued to consultants of $590,335, deccrease in
prepaid expenses of $750, an increase of accrued expenses and other
payables-related party of $282,743 and an increase in accounts
payable of $70,950.  

Our
investing activities were $2,488 and $39,285 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively. Our investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are attributable to purchases of
fixed assets. 

Our
financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of $925,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is represented by
$875,000 proceeds from issuance of common stock and $50,000
proceeds from shareholder note payable. Our financing activities
resulted in cash inflow of $450,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, which is represented by $450,000 proceeds from
issuance of common stock. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to
investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Please
refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for
disclosures regarding the Company's critical accounting policies
and estimates, as well as updates further disclosed in our interim
financial statements as described in this Form 10-Q.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of
the end of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon those
evaluations, management concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, to cause
the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our chief executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

Going
forward from this filing, the Company intends to work on
re-establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )
that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part,
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter covered by this Report, there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting. No
remediation has been made in this quarter since, as we stated in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, we have not yet commercialized a recombinant fiber and,
therefore do not yet have sufficient cash flow to carry out our
remediation plans.

Part II   Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation or other
legal proceedings that it considers to be a part of the ordinary
course of its business. To the best of our knowledge, the Company
is not currently involved in any legal proceedings that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations;
however, the Company may become involved in material legal
proceedings in the future.
