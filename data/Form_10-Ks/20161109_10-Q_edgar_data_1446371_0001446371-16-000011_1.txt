  1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
  Strategic Realty Trust, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on September 18, 2008, as a Maryland corporation. Effective August 22, 2013, the Company changed its name from TNP Strategic Retail Trust, Inc. to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc. The Company believes it qualifies as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ), and has elected REIT status beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, the year in which the Company began material operations. 
  Since the Company s inception, its business has been managed by an external advisor. The Company has no direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting the Company s business are employed by its advisor. Currently, the Company is externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Advisor ) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the  Advisory Agreement ) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed in August 2014, August 2015 and August 2016. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2017. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates,  Glenborough ), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties. 
  Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  OP ). During the Company s initial public offering ( Offering ), as the Company accepted subscriptions for shares of its common stock, it transferred substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to the OP as a capital contribution. The Company is the sole general partner of the OP. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned   96.3%   and   96.2%  , respectively, of the limited partnership interest in the OP. 
  The Company s principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate assets, the payment of operating expenses, interest on outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to stockholders, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as development of properties. Substantially all of the proceeds of the completed Offering have been used to fund investments in real properties and other real estate-related assets, for payment of operating expenses, for payment of interest, for payment of various fees and expenses, such as acquisition fees and management fees, and for payment of distributions to stockholders. The Company s available capital resources, cash and cash equivalents on hand and sources of liquidity are currently limited. The Company expects its future cash needs will be funded using cash from operations, future asset sales, debt financing and the proceeds to the Company from any sale of equity that it may conduct in the future. 
  The Company invests in and manages a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. The Company has invested directly, and indirectly through joint ventures, in a portfolio of income-producing retail properties located throughout the United States, with a focus on grocery anchored multi-tenant retail centers, including neighborhood, community and lifestyle shopping centers, multi-tenant shopping centers and free standing single-tenant retail properties. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , in addition to the development projects, the Company s portfolio of properties was comprised of   11   properties with approximately   697,000   rentable square feet of retail space located in   6   states. As of   September 30, 2016  , the rentable space at the Company s retail properties was   89%   leased. 
   
  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( the SEC ), including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the OP, their direct and indirect owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint ventures that are determined to be variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included. 
  The Company evaluates the need to consolidate joint ventures and variable interest entities based on standards set forth in ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation   ( ASC 810 ). In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a joint venture  
  
   8 

    STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

or a variable interest entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members, as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held ownership interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures. Refer to Note 4,  Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  for additional information. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held variable interests in two variable interest entities and consolidated those entities. Refer to Note 5,  Variable Interest Entities  for additional information. 
  Properties Under Development 
  The initial cost of properties under development includes the acquisition cost of the property, direct development costs and borrowing costs directly attributable to the development. Borrowing costs associated with direct expenditures on properties under development are capitalized. The amount of capitalized borrowing costs is determined by reference to borrowings specific to the project, where relevant. Borrowing costs are capitalized from the commencement of the development until the date of practical completion where the property is substantially ready for its intended use. Capitalization of borrowing costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted. Practical completion is when the property is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 
  Interest on projects is based on interest rates in place during the development period, and is capitalized until the project is ready for its intended use. The amount of interest capitalized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $2.0 million  . 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period s presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , in respect to the Company s adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ), the Company classified deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, as a contra-liability to notes payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires retrospective application, wherein the balance sheet of each period presented should be adjusted to reflect the effects of the new guidance. Accordingly, for comparative purposes herein, the Company reclassified the   December 31, 2015   balance of   $0.3 million   of deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, as a contra-liability to notes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, and   $0.1 million   of deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, as a contra-liability to liabilities held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
  Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. ASU 2015-03 is limited to the presentation of debt issuance costs and does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs as the Company presents debt issuance costs as deferred financing costs, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. ASU 2015-03 does not address how debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements should be presented on the balance sheet or amortized. Given this absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  , Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarifies that the SEC Staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. Effective January 2016, the Company presents deferred financing costs, net, as a contra-liability in periods when there is an associated debt liability on the balance sheet, rather than as a deferred asset. If no associated debt liability is recorded on the balance sheet, deferred financing costs are presented as a deferred asset. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustment   ( ASU 2015-16 ) effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Further, the acquirer is required to record, in the financial statements for the same period, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the  
  
   9 

    STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

acquisition date. Entities must also present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by the line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance should be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 had no impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  The FASB issued the following Accounting Standards Updates ( ASUs ) which could have potential impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements: 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. ASU 2016-15 will require adoption on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the application of ASU 2016-15 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset, measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Adjustments resulting from adopting ASU 2016-13 shall be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).     ASU 2016-02 requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous guidance. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the previous guidance. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which effectively defers the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies may apply either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this guidance. In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-09 and ASU No. 2016-12, which provide interpretive clarifications on the new guidance in Topic 606. The Company is currently evaluating the transition methods and the impact of the guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  3. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS 
  Acquisition of Properties 
  On September 8, 2016, the Company paid a deposit in the amount of approximately   $0.2 million   toward the acquisition of a   100%   ownership interest in certain property located at 388 Fulton Street in San Francisco, California ( 388 Fulton ). The deposit was included in prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The seller is not affiliated with the Company or the Advisor. 388 Fulton is comprised of two leased commercial condominiums with an aggregate of   1,902   square feet of retail space. The purchase of this retail property is expected to close in early 2017. 
  On July 27, 2016, the Company purchased a   100%   ownership interest in Fulton Street Shops located in San Francisco, California ( Fulton Shops ).

The aggregate purchase price of Fulton Shops was approximately   $4.6 million   subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments.

    STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

On June 14, 2016, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a   100%   ownership interest in two retail properties located in San Francisco, California (the  San Francisco Properties ) from each of Octavia Gateway Holdings, LLC and Grove Street Hayes Valley, LLC, each a Delaware limited liability company and each a subsidiary of DDG Partners LLC. The sellers were not affiliated with the Company or the Advisor. The San Francisco Properties encompass four retail condominiums with an aggregate of   5,640   square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of the San Francisco Properties was approximately   $5.6 million   subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. The Company funded the purchase price using borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility ( KeyBank credit facility ). Refer to Note 8.  Notes Payable, Net  for details. 
  In conjunction with the acquisition of the San Francisco Properties, on May 4, 2016, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a retail property from Hayes Street Hayes Valley LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of DDG Partners LLC. The Company paid a deposit in the amount of approximately   $0.6 million   toward the acquisition of a   100%   ownership interest in certain property located at 450 Hayes Street in San Francisco, California ( 450 Hayes ). The seller is not affiliated with the Company or its external advisor. The purchase of this retail property is expected to close later in 2016. 
  The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities as of the acquisition date (amounts in thousands): 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company finalized the allocations of the purchase prices and made certain measurement period adjustments. These allocation adjustments did not impact the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Lease intangibles and below-market lease liabilities generally relate to commercial leases. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining weighted-average amortization period of lease intangibles and below-market lease liabilities related to the acquired properties was   9.5 years   and   9.6 years  , respectively. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of the San Francisco Properties and the Fulton Shops. These costs are included in transaction expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  2016 Sale of Properties 
  On April 4, 2016, the Company consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately   $9.2 million   in cash, a portion of which was used to pay off the related   $5.3 million   mortgage loan and   $3.0 million   of which was used to pay down the line of credit under its KeyBank credit facility. The sale of the property did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results and its results of operations were not reported as discontinued operations on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The disposition of Bloomingdale Hills resulted in a gain of   $0.6 million  , which was included on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations include net operating income of approximately   $73,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $71,000   for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

    The original purchase price for Osceola Village included an additional pad which was sold for approximately   $0.9 million   prior to this transaction. 
     The sale of the three properties did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results and, as a result, was not included in discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations include net operating income of approximately   $7,000   and net operating loss of approximately   $0.3 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , relating to the results of operations for the three sold properties. 
  The sale of Osceola Village, Constitution Trail and Aurora Commons (the  SGO Properties ) was completed in connection with the formation of the SGO Joint Venture. The three properties were sold to the SGO Joint Venture, and the closing of the sale was conditioned on the Company receiving a   19%   membership interest in the SGO Joint Venture. In exchange for this   19%   membership interest, the Company contributed   $4.5 million   to the SGO Joint Venture, which amount was credited against the Company s proceeds from the sale of the three properties to the SGO Joint Venture. Of the net sales proceeds from the sale of the aforementioned properties,   $36.4 million   was used by the Company to retire the debt associated with the sold properties. Since the sale of the SGO Properties did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results, their results of operations were not reported as discontinued operations on the Company s financial statements.

contribution and specified preferred returns, all distributions go to the Company; thereafter, the Wilshire Joint Venture will distribute the profits   50%   to the Company and   50%   to 3032 Wilshire SM. 
  The following reflects the assets and liabilities of the Gelson s Joint Venture and the Wilshire Joint Venture, which were consolidated by the Company, as of   September 30, 2016   (amounts in thousands):

  6. FUTURE MINIMUM RENTAL INCOME 
  Operating Leases 
  The Company s real estate properties are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary. As of   September 30, 2016  , the leases at the Company s properties have remaining terms (excluding options to extend) of up to   20 years   with a weighted-average remaining term (excluding options to extend) of   5 years  . The leases may have provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires security deposits from tenants in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit. Amounts required as security deposits vary depending upon the terms of the respective leases and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally are not significant amounts. Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and totaled approximately   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

agreement. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Wilshire development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement. 
  In connection with the Company s investment in the Gelson s Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5.  Variable Interest Entities  to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) and the acquisition of the Gelson s Property (defined in Note 5.  Variable Interest Entities  to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), the Company has consolidated borrowings of   $10.7 million   (the  Gelson s Loan ) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and Sunset and Gardner Investors, LLC (as the borrower).

  9. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
  Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines fair value using the following hierarchy: 
             
    Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3 - prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. 
     The Company believes the total carrying values reflected on its condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and amounts due to affiliates reasonably approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
  The fair value of the Company s notes payable is estimated using a present value technique based on contractual cash flows and management s observations of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. The Company significantly reduces the amount of judgment and subjectivity in its fair value determination through the use of cash flow inputs that are based on contractual obligations. Discount rates are determined by observing interest rates published by independent market participants for comparable instruments. The Company classifies these inputs as Level 2 inputs. 
  The following table provides the carrying values and fair values of the Company s notes payable related to continuing operations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    The carrying value of the Company s notes payable represents the outstanding principal as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The carrying values and fair values of the notes payable include the reclassification of deferred financing costs, net, of approximately   $0.5 million   and approximately   $0.3 million  , as a contra-liability, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    The estimated fair value of the notes payable is based upon the indicative market prices of the Company s notes payable based on prevailing market interest rates. 
      
  10. EQUITY 
  Share Redemption Program 
  On April 1, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program (which had been suspended since January 15, 2013) and adopted an Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the  SRP ). Under the SRP, only shares submitted for repurchase in connection with the death or  qualifying disability  (as defined in the SRP) of a stockholder are eligible for repurchase by the Company. The number of shares to be redeemed is limited to the lesser of (i) a total of   $2.0 million   for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death and a total of   $1.0 million   for redemptions  
  
   17 

    STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

sought upon a stockholder s qualifying disability, and (ii)   5%   of the number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year. Share repurchases pursuant to the SRP are made at the sole discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the right to reject any redemption request for any reason or no reason or to amend or terminate the share redemption program at any time subject to the notice requirements in the SRP. 
  The redemption price for shares that are redeemed is   100%   of the Company s most recent estimated net asset value per share as of the applicable redemption date. A redemption request must be made within one year after the stockholder s death or disability, unless such death or disability occurred between January 15, 2013 and April 1, 2015, when the share redemption program was suspended. Redemption requests due to the death or disability of a Company stockholder that occurred during such time period, were required to be submitted on or before April 1, 2016. 
  The SRP provides that any request to redeem less than   $5,000   worth of shares will be treated as a request to redeem all of the stockholder s shares. If the Company cannot honor all redemption requests received in a given quarter, all requests, including death and disability redemptions, will be honored on a pro rata basis. If the Company does not completely satisfy a redemption request in one quarter, it will treat the unsatisfied portion as a request for redemption in the next quarter when funds are available for redemption, unless the request is withdrawn. The Company may increase or decrease the amount of funding available for redemptions under the SRP on ten business days  notice to stockholders. Shares submitted for redemption during any quarter will be redeemed on the penultimate business day of such quarter. The record date for quarterly distributions has historically been and is expected to continue to be the last business day of each quarter; therefore, shares that are redeemed during any quarter are expected to be redeemed prior to the record date and thus would not be eligible to receive the distribution declared for such quarter. 
  The other material terms of the SRP are consistent with the terms of the share redemption program that was in effect immediately prior to January 15, 2013. 
  On August 7, 2015, the board of directors approved the amendment and restatement of the SRP (the  First A R SRP ). Under the First A R SRP, the redemption date with respect to third quarter 2015 redemptions was November 10, 2015 or the next practicable date as the Chief Executive Officer determined so that redemptions with respect to the third quarter of 2015 were delayed until after the payment date for the Special Distribution. With this revision, stockholders who were to have 100% of their shares redeemed were not left holding a small number of shares from the Special Distribution after the date of the redemption of their shares. The other material terms of the First A R SRP are consistent with the terms of the SRP. 
  On August 10, 2016, the board of directors authorized management of the Company to prepare and implement an amendment and restatement of the SRP (the  Second A R SRP ) to revise the definition of disability under the SRP. The Second A R SRP became effective August 26, 2016. Under the Second A R SRP, a person is deemed to be disabled and therefore eligible to redeem shares pursuant to the Second A R SRP if they are disabled pursuant to the definition of  disability  in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at the time that the person s written redemption request is received by the Company. The other material terms of the Second A R SRP are consistent with the terms of the First A R SRP. 
  On October 5, 2016, the board of directors approved, pursuant to Section 3(a) of SRP, an additional   $0.5 million   of funds available for the redemption of shares in connection with the death of a stockholder.  
  The following table summarizes share redemption activity during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands, except shares): 

Cumulatively, through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has redeemed   437,825   shares sold in its initial public offering and/or the dividend reinvestment plan for   $3.5 million  . 
  Quarterly Distributions 
  In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least   90%   of its annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to its stockholders. Some or all of the Company s distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations.

    STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (unaudited) 

Under the terms of the Key Bank credit facility, the Company may pay distributions to its investors so long as the total amount paid does not exceed   100%   of the cumulative Adjusted Funds From Operations provided, however, that the Company is not restricted from making any distributions necessary in order to maintain its status as a REIT. The Company s board of directors evaluates the Company s ability to make quarterly distributions based on the Company s operational cash needs. 
  The following tables set forth the quarterly distributions declared to the Company s common stockholders and Common Unit holders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the year ended   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): 

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed after adjusting the basic EPS computation for the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The effect of non-vested shares, if dilutive, is computed using the treasury stock method. The Company applies the two-class method for determining EPS as its outstanding shares of non-vested restricted stock are considered participating securities as dividend payments are not forfeited even if the underlying award does not vest. There was no unvested stock as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company s excess of distributions over earnings related to participating securities are shown as a reduction in income (loss) attributable to common stockholders in the Company s computation of EPS.

(1) 
    The effect of   422,308   convertible Common Units pursuant to the redemption rights outlined in the Company s registration statement on Form S-11 have not been included as they would not be dilutive. 
      
  12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  On August 7, 2013, the Company entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. On August 10, 2016, the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor was renewed for an additional twelve months, beginning on August 10, 2016. The Advisor manages the Company s business as the Company s external advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Advisor specified fees for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of the Company s investments and for other services. 
  On July 9, 2013, SRT Manager, an affiliate of the Advisor, acquired an initial   12%   membership interest in SRT Holdings, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary. Following OP s additional contribution to SRT Holdings on August 4, 2014, SRT Manager s membership interests in SRT Holdings decreased to   8.33%  . In March 2015, SRT Holdings paid SRT Manager   $2.1 million   in full redemption of SRT Manager s   8.33%   membership interest in SRT Holdings.

Related-Party Fees Paid by the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  The unconsolidated joint ventures are party to certain agreements with Glenborough for services related to the investment of funds and management of the joint ventures  investments, as well as the day-to-day management, operation and maintenance of the properties owned by the joint ventures.

The SGO MN Joint Venture began operations on September 30, 2015 and therefore incurred insignificant related-party fees for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The related-party amounts consist of property management, asset management, leasing commission, legal leasing, construction management fees and salary reimbursements. 
   
  13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Economic Dependency 
  The Company is dependent on the Advisor and its affiliates for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, purchase, and disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments, management of the daily operations of the Company s real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio, and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that the Advisor is unable to provide such services to the Company, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 
  Environmental 
  As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities. 
   
  14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 27, 2016, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an unrelated third party purchaser (the  Purchaser ) for the sale of an approximately   114,000   square foot retail property located in Bismarck, North Dakota ( Pinehurst Square East ). The contractual sale price of Pinehurst Square East is   $19.2 million  . Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Purchaser would be obligated to purchase the property and the Company would be obligated to sell the property only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the Company will complete the sale.

ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other unaudited financial data included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 30, 2016, which we refer to herein as our  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  As used herein, the terms  we,   our,   us,  and  Company  refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our  operating partnership  or  OP , and to their respective subsidiaries. References to  shares  and  our common stock  refer to the shares of our common stock.  
   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning investment objectives, other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto) are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
  The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    Our executive officers and certain other key real estate professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and conflicts in allocating time among us and other programs and business activities. 
                
    Our initial public offering has terminated and we are uncertain of our sources for funding our future capital needs. If we cannot obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to continue to acquire real properties or other real estate-related assets, fund or expand our operations and pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. 
                
    We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in tenants (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our financial obligations, including debt service and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
                
    Our current and future investments in real estate and other real estate-related investments may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions, which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders. Revenues from our properties could decrease. Such events would make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
                
    Certain of our debt obligations have variable interest rates with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR or other indices. Increases in these indices could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included herein could be inaccurate, and undue reliance should not be placed upon on any forward-looking statements included herein. All forward-looking statements  
  
   24 

are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from the expectations expressed herein will increase with the passage of time. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the risks described in Part I, Item 1A of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, the inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be achieved. 
   
  Overview 
  We are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we intend to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.  
  Since our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We no longer have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Advisor ) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the  Advisory Agreement ) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed in August 2014, August 2015 and August 2016. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2017. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates,  Glenborough ), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties. 
   
  Property Portfolio 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our property portfolio included   11   retail properties, which we refer to as  our properties  or  our portfolio,  comprising an aggregate of   697,406   square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in   6   states. We purchased our properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $97.9 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was approximately   $34.0 million   and approximately $39.8 million of indebtedness on our properties, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   89%   and 90% of our portfolio was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with weighted-average remaining lease terms of approximately   5 years   as of both period ends. 

(1) 
    Square feet include improvements made on ground leases at the property. 
              (2) 
    Percentage is based on leased rentable square feet of each property as of   September 30, 2016  . 
     
   25 

(3) 
    Effective rent per square foot is calculated by dividing the annualized   September 2016   contractual base rent by the total square feet occupied at the property. The contractual base rent does not include other items such as tenant concessions (e.g., free rent), percentage rent, and expense recoveries. 
              (4) 
    The purchase price for Pinehurst Square and Shops at Turkey Creek includes the issuance of common units in our operating partnership to the sellers. 
              (5) 
    Debt represents the outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016  , and excludes reclassification of approximately   $0.3 million   deferred financing costs, net, as a contra-liability. For more information on our financing, refer to Note 8.  Notes Payable, Net  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of   September 30, 2016  , the KeyBank credit facility principal balance of   $16.2 million   was secured by Pinehurst Square, Topaz Marketplace, 8 Octavia Street, 400 Grove Street and the Fulton Shops. For information regarding recent draws under the Key Bank credit facility, see    Recent Financing Transactions - KeyBank Credit Facility.  
      
  Properties Under Development 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 2 properties under development. The properties are identified in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands):

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  The following tables provide summary information about our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of those expected in future periods. 
  Revenue 
  The decrease in revenue during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to the sale of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015 and Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  The decrease in revenue during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015 and Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. The sale of the three properties in March 2015 was completed in connection with the formation of the SGO Joint Venture (as described in Note 4.  Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
  Operating and maintenance expenses  
  The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to the sale of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily attributed to the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March  
  
   27 

2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  General and administrative expenses 
  The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to a write-off in 2015 of the remaining unamortized premium of an insurance policy of approximately $0.3 million. Additionally, asset management fees decreased during the third quarter of 2016 due to sold properties. 
  The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to a write-off in 2015 of the remaining unamortized premium of an insurance policy of approximately $0.3 million. Lower legal costs also contributed to the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses, with the resolution of the class action lawsuit in 2015. Additionally, asset management fees declined in 2016 due to the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses 
  The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was not significant. 
  The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was attributed to the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015 and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  Transaction expense 
  The increase in transaction expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to our acquisition fees for our investment in the Fulton Shops. Refer to Note 3.  Real Estate Investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  The increase in transaction expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to acquisition fees for our investments in 400 Grove Street, 8 Octavia Street and the Fulton Shops. Refer to Note 3.  Real Estate Investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Interest expense 
  The decrease in interest expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to loan pay-offs using the proceeds from the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  The decrease in interest expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to loan pay-offs using the proceeds from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. 
  Other income (loss), net 
  Other income, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily consisted of equity in income resulting from our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. Other loss, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , included approximately $0.3 million representing our share in the losses resulting from our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, an additional accrual of an estimated interest penalty payable to the IRS related to the deficiency dividend in 2011, and an adjustment to the gain related to the March 2015 disposal of real estate. 
  Other loss, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily consisted of approximately $1.0 million related to prepayment penalties on extinguishment of debt as well as the write-off of unamortized loan fees related to the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. This was partially offset by the gain on sale of Bloomingdale Hills of approximately $0.6 million, as well as the equity in income resulting from our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $0.3 million. Other income, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily consisted of the net gain of approximately $4.9 million and the write-off of unamortized loan fees of approximately $0.2 million recorded in conjunction with the sale and payoff of related debt of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, as well as the equity in income resulting from our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  
   28 

Income taxes 
  We have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , income taxes primarily include taxes on our share of the gain from the second quarter sale of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties. This is partially offset by the reversal of an over accrual of estimated alternative minimum state/federal taxes, which was accrued and included in expenses as of December 31, 2015. The over accrual was determined as a result of finalizing, in 2016, the calculation of taxes owed for 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Since our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we utilized the net proceeds from the fourth quarter 2015 disposition of our properties (remaining after paydown of debt) to invest in the Gelson s Joint Venture and the Wilshire Joint Venture. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents were approximately   $3.9 million   and our restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs) was approximately   $5.7 million  . For properties with such lender reserves, we may draw upon such reserves to fund the specific needs for which the funds were established. 
  Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our  charter,  we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. The preceding calculation is generally expected to approximate 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets before non-cash reserves and depreciation. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our borrowings were approximately   141.2%   and 65.3%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets. 
  The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in thousands): 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in operating losses and adjustments for non-cash items of approximately $0.4 million, as well as larger net deposits to restricted cash for operational expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2016. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  The change in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson s Joint Ventures during the first quarter of 2016, consisting of land and building under development and development costs, of approximately   $29.5 million  , as well as our acquisitions of 400 Grove Street and 8 Octavia Street during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and our acquisition of the Fulton Shops during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which, in aggregate, consisted of land and buildings, totaling   $10.2 million  . Additionally, cash flows from investing activities during the  
  
   29 

nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of proceeds of $53.1 million, before the pay down of debt, from the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail and Osceola Village. 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  The change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to loan proceeds during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , of approximately   $38.4 million   in connection with our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson s Joint Ventures and additional draws under our Amended and Restated Credit Facility ( Key Bank credit facility ), compared to the pay down of debt in the amount of   $37.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   resulting from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail and Osceola Village. 
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses, the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, and distributions. To date, our cash needs for operations have been covered from cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. Due to the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, we may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. Until the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, our cash needs for acquisitions were satisfied from the net proceeds of the public offering and from debt financings. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 8.  Notes Payable, Net  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness. 
   
  Recent Financing Transactions 
  KeyBank Credit Facility 
  On March 7, 2016, we drew $6.0 million under the Key Bank credit facility and used the proceeds to invest in the Wilshire Joint Venture. Refer to Note 5.  Variable Interest Entities  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  On June 9, 2016, we drew approximately $7.5 million under the Key Bank credit facility, the majority of which was used to fund the purchase of the San Francisco Properties. Refer to Note 3.  Real Estate Investments  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  On July 25, 2016, we drew   $4.7 million   under the Key Bank credit facility and used the majority of the proceeds to acquire the Fulton Shops. Refer to Note 3  Real Estate Investments  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  On April 4, 2016, we consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately   $9.2 million   in cash,   $3.0 million   of which was used to pay down the line of credit under our KeyBank credit facility.  Additionally, on September 29, 2016, we drew   $1.0 million   under the Key Bank credit facility to be used for working capital. 
  Mortgage Loans Secured by Properties Under Development 
  In connection with our investment in the Wilshire Joint Venture and the acquisition of the Wilshire Property, we have consolidated borrowings of   $8.5 million   (the  Wilshire Loan ) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and 3032 Wilshire Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Wilshire Loan bears interest at a rate of   10.0%   per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on   March 7, 2017  , with an option for an additional six-month period, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Wilshire development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement. 
  In connection with our investment in the Gelson s Joint Venture and the acquisition of the Gelson s Property, we have consolidated borrowings of   $10.7 million   (the  Gelson s Loan ) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and Sunset and Gardner Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Gelson s Loan bears interest at a rate of   9.5%   per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on   January 27, 2017  , with an option to extend for an additional six- 
  
   30 

month period, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Gelson s development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement. 
   
  Interim Financial Information 
  The financial information as of and for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is unaudited, but includes all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; and such results may be less favorable. Our accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Guidelines on Total Operating Expenses 
  We reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the  2%/25% Guidelines  unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines. 
   
  Inflation 
  The majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates. 
   
  REIT Compliance 
  To qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In 2015, we made a special distribution to stockholders to preserve our REIT status based on underreporting of federal taxable income in 2011 (the  Special Distribution ). 
   
  Quarterly Distributions 
  As set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. 
  Under the terms of the Key Bank credit facility, we may pay distributions to our stockholders so long as the total amount paid does not exceed certain thresholds specified in the Key Bank credit facility provided, however, that we are not restricted from making any distributions necessary in order to maintain our status as a REIT. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs. 
  Some or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations. 
  
   31 

The following tables set forth the quarterly distributions declared to our common stockholders and common unit holders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the year ended   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Funds From Operations 
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company s operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or  NAREIT , an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions. 
  We consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 
  
   32 

Our calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts): 

(1) 
    Our Common Units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion. Therefore, we are including the related non-controlling interest income/loss attributable to Common Units in the computation of FFO and including the Common Units together with weighted average shares outstanding for the computation of FFO per share and Common Unit. 
              (2) 
    Where applicable, adjustments exclude amounts attributable to membership interest. 
      
  Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 12.  Related Party Transactions  to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.    
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures and are described in Note 4.  Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint ventures  debts are secured by a first mortgage, are without recourse to the joint venture partners, and do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for certain matters such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds and material misrepresentations. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have provided carve-out guarantees in connection with our two unconsolidated joint ventures; in connection with those carve-out guarantees we have certain rights of recovery from our joint venture partners.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Subsequent Events 
  On October 27, 2016, we, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an unrelated third party purchaser (the  Purchaser ) for the sale of an approximately   114,000   square foot retail property located in Bismarck, North Dakota ( Pinehurst Square East ). The contractual sale price of Pinehurst Square East is   $19.2 million  . Pursuant to the  
  
   33 

Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Purchaser would be obligated to purchase the property and we would be obligated to sell the property only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. There can be no assurance that we will complete the sale.

  ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  Omitted as permitted under rules applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
   
  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we did not issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
  Share Redemption Program 
  On April 1, 2015, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program (which had been suspended since January 15, 2013) and adopted an Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the  SRP ). Under the SRP, only shares submitted for repurchase in connection with the death or  qualifying disability  (as defined in the SRP) of a stockholder are eligible for repurchase by us. The number of shares to be redeemed is limited to the lesser of (i) a total of   $2.0 million   for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death and a total of   $1.0 million   for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s qualifying disability, and (ii)   5%   of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year. Share repurchases pursuant to the SRP are made at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to reject any redemption request for any reason or no reason or to amend or terminate the share redemption program at any time subject to the notice requirements in the SRP. 
  The redemption price for shares that are redeemed is   100%   of our most recent estimated net asset value per share as of the applicable redemption date. A redemption request must be made within one year after the stockholder s death or disability, unless such death or disability occurred between January 15, 2013 and April 1, 2015, when the share redemption program was suspended. Redemption requests due to the death or disability of a Company stockholder that occurred during such time period, were required to be submitted on or before April 1, 2016. 
  The SRP provides that any request to redeem less than   $5,000   worth of shares will be treated as a request to redeem all of the stockholder s shares. If the we cannot honor all redemption requests received in a given quarter, all requests, including death and disability redemptions, will be honored on a pro rata basis. If the we do not completely satisfy a redemption request in one quarter, we will treat the unsatisfied portion as a request for redemption in the next quarter when funds are available for redemption, unless the request is withdrawn. We may increase or decrease the amount of funding available for redemptions under the SRP on ten business days  notice to stockholders. Shares submitted for redemption during any quarter will be redeemed on the penultimate business day of such quarter. The record date for quarterly distributions has historically been and is expected to continue to be the last business day of each quarter; therefore, shares that are redeemed during any quarter are expected to be redeemed prior to the record date and thus would not be eligible to receive the distribution declared for such quarter. 
  The other material terms of the SRP are consistent with the terms of the share redemption program that was in effect immediately prior to January 15, 2013. 
  On August 7, 2015, our board of directors approved the amendment and restatement of the SRP (the  First A R SRP ). Under the First A R SRP, the redemption date with respect to third quarter 2015 redemptions was November 10, 2015 or the next practicable date as the Chief Executive Officer determined so that redemptions with respect to the third quarter of 2015 were delayed until after the payment date for the Special Distribution. With this revision, stockholders who were to have 100% of their shares redeemed were not left holding a small number of shares from the Special Distribution after the date of the redemption of their shares. The other material terms of the First A R SRP are consistent with the terms of the SRP. 
  On August 10, 2016, our board of directors authorized our management to prepare and implement an amendment and restatement of the SRP (the  Second A R SRP ) to revise the definition of disability under the SRP. The Second A R SRP became effective August 26, 2016. Under the Second A R SRP, a person is deemed to be disabled and therefore eligible to redeem shares pursuant to the Second A R SRP if they are disabled pursuant to the definition of  disability  in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at the time that the person s written redemption request is received by us. The other material terms of the Second A R SRP are consistent with the terms of the First A R SRP. 
  On October 5, 2016, our board of directors approved, pursuant to Section 3(a) of SRP, an additional $0.5 million of funds available for the redemption of shares in connection with the death of a stockholder.  
  
   35 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares as follows: 

(1) 
    All of our purchases of equity securities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were made pursuant to the SRP. 
              (2) 
    We currently limit the dollar value and number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the SRP as described above. 
     Cumulatively, through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has redeemed   437,825   shares sold in its initial public offering for   $3.5 million  .
