  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

  Six Months Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1: BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION  

The Company was incorporated in New York on March 21, 1975 for the purpose
of engaging in the development, manufacture, and sale of ultrasonic liquid atomizing nozzles, which are sold world-wide. Ultrasonic
nozzle systems atomize low to medium viscosity liquids by converting electrical energy into mechanical motion in the form of high
frequency ultrasonic vibrations that break liquids into minute drops that can be applied to surfaces at low velocity. 

Based on its core technology of ultrasonic liquid atomizing nozzles, the
Company has developed intellectual property in the area of precision spray coating of liquids. The Company is presently engaged
in the development, manufacture, sales, installation and servicing of diverse ultrasonic coating equipment for various manufacturing
industries worldwide. 

NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Available-For-Sale Investments     The Company s
available for sale investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity. Realized losses and declines in value below cost
judged to be other than temporary, if any, are included as a component of asset impairments expense in the consolidated statement
of operations. The fair value of the available-for-sale investments are based on quoted market prices. The Company s fair
value determination method is discussed below in  Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents    -  Cash and cash equivalents
consist of money market mutual funds, short term commercial paper and short-term certificates of deposit with original maturities
of 90 days or less. 

Consolidation   - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
of Sono-Tek Corporation, a New York corporation (the  Company ), include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Sono-Tek Cleaning Systems Inc. and Sono-Tek Industrial Park, LLC. Sono-Tek Cleaning Systems, Inc., a New Jersey
Corporation ( SCS ), ceased operations during the Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2002. Sono-Tek Industrial Park, LLC
( SIP ), operates as a real estate holding company for the Company s real estate operations. 

Earnings Per Share    -  Basic earnings per share ( EPS )
is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock. 

Equipment, Furnishings and Leasehold Improvements    
Equipment, furnishings and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and furnishings is computed by
use of the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments -  
The Company follows the guidance in the  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Topic  of the Accounting Standards
Codification for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. This guidance establishes a common definition
for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The guidance defines
fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the guidance requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: 

4   

Level 1: Quoted prices in
active markets. 

Level 2: Observable market-based
inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs
for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions. 

The fair values of financial
assets of the Company were determined using the following categories at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively: 

Marketable Securities include
mutual funds of $1,858,953 and $1,695,689 that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradeable as of August 31, 2016 and
February 29, 2016, respectively. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities
and are therefore classified as Level 1 within the Company s fair value hierarchy. The Company s marketable securities
are considered to be available-for-sale investments as defined under ASC 320  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities.  

Income Taxes     - The Company accounts for income taxes
under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of  temporary
differences  by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. 

Intangible Assets    - Include   costs of patent applications
which are deferred and charged to operations over seventeen years for domestic patents and twelve years for foreign patents. The
accumulated amortization of patents is $133,000 and $127,900 at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively. Annual amortization
expense of such intangible assets is expected to be approximately $11,000 per year for the next five years. 

Interim Reporting   - The attached summary condensed consolidated
financial information does not include all disclosures required to be included in a complete set of financial statements prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Such disclosures were included with
the financial statements of the Company at February 29, 2016, and included in its report on Form 10-K. Such statements should be
read in conjunction with the data herein. 

The financial information reflects all adjustments, normal and recurring,
which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The results for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the year. 

Inventories    -  Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for raw materials, subassemblies and work-in-progress
and the specific identification method for finished goods. 

5   

Land and Buildings     Land and buildings are stated at
cost. Buildings are being depreciated by use of the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of forty years. 

Long-Lived Assets    -  The Company periodically evaluates
the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The
carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately
identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash
flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. 

Management Estimates    -  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements-   All new accounting pronouncements
issued but not yet effective have been deemed to be not applicable to the Company. Hence, the adoption of these new accounting
pronouncements once effective are not expected to have an impact on the Company. 

Reclassifications     Where appropriate, certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior period to conform to the presentations of the current period. 

NOTE 3: INVENTORIES 

Inventories consist of the following: 

NOTE 4: STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  

Stock Options       Under the 2013 Stock
Incentive Plan ( 2013 Plan ), options can be granted to officers, directors, consultants and employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Under the 2013 Plan options expire ten years
after the date of grant. As of August 31, 2016, there were 641,600 options outstanding under the 2013 Plan. 

Under the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended ( 2003 Plan ),
until May 2013, options were available to be granted to officers, directors, consultants and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. As of August 31, 2016, there were 200,500 options outstanding
under the 2003 Plan, under which no additional options may be granted. 

6   

NOTE 5: STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

The weighted-average fair value of options are estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. 

In computing the impact, the fair value of each option is estimated
on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate;
volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment
awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company s stock-based compensation
expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate
and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed
its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total
options outstanding. If the Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company
reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what
the Company has recorded in the current period. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, net income
and earnings per share reflect the actual deduction for stock-based compensation expense. The impact of applying ASC 718 approximated
$19,000 and $22,000 in additional compensation expense during the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such
amounts are included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations. The expense for stock-based compensation
is a non-cash expense item. 

NOTE 6: EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 

The denominators for the calculation of diluted earnings per share at August
31, 2016 and 2015 are calculated as follows: 

The effect of stock options for the three and six months ended August 31,
2016 are not used in the calculation of earnings per share. Due to the net loss for the three and six month periods ended August
31, 2016, the inclusion of stock options in the calculations would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

For the three and six months ended August 31, 2016, potentially dilutive
securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share consist of 369,520 stock options. 

7   

NOTE 7: OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  

As of August 31, 2016, certain of the Company s marketable securities
were in an unrealized gain position. Unrealized gains and losses are principally due to changes in fair value of the investments
held as available-for-sale. The Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable
future as classified as available-for-sale. The Company does not deem these unrealized gains or losses to be other than temporary. 

As of August 31, 2016, the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities
was $22,232. 

The following table sets forth the changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Gain (Loss) for the six months ended August 31, 2016: 

NOTE 8: LONG TERM DEBT  

Long-term debt consists of the following: 

NOTE 9: REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  

The Company has a $750,000 revolving line of credit at prime which was 3.50%
at August 31, 2016. The loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the Company, except for the land and buildings. The line
of credit is payable on demand and must be retired for a 30 day period once annually. If the Company fails to perform the 30 day
annual pay down or if the bank elects to terminate the credit line, the bank may at its option convert the outstanding balance
to a 36 month term note with payments including interest in 36 equal installments. As of August 31, 2016, the Company s outstanding
balance was $0, and the unused credit line was $750,000. 

8   

NOTE 10: SEGMENT INFORMATION  

The Company operates in two segments: ultrasonic spray coating systems,
which is the business of developing, manufacturing, selling, installing and servicing ultrasonic spray coating equipment; and real
estate operations, which is the business of owning and operating the Sono-Tek Industrial Park. 

All inter-company transactions are eliminated in consolidation. For the
six and three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, segment information is as follows:

ITEM 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward-Looking Statements   

We discuss expectations regarding our future performance, such as our business
outlook, in our annual and quarterly reports, press releases, and other written and oral statements. These  forward-looking
statements  are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently
uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. These factors
include, among other considerations, general economic and business conditions; political, regulatory, competitive and technological
developments affecting our operations or the demand for our products; timely development and market acceptance of new products;
adequacy of financing; capacity additions, the ability to enforce patents and the ability to achieve increased sales volume and
continued profitability. 

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 

Overview   

We have developed a unique and proprietary series of ultrasonic atomizing
nozzles and systems, which are being used in an increasing variety of electronics, advanced energy (solar and fuel cells), medical
device, glass, textiles and food applications. These nozzles are electrically driven and create a fine, uniform, low velocity spray
of atomized liquid particles, in contrast to common pressure nozzles. These characteristics create a series of commercial applications
that benefit from the precise, uniform, thin coatings that can be achieved. When combined with significant reductions in liquid
waste and less overspray than can be achieved with ordinary pressure nozzle systems, there is lower environmental impact and lower
energy use. 

Market Diversity   

During the past five years we have invested significant time, monies and
efforts to enhance our market diversity. Based on our core ultrasonic coating technology, we increased our portfolio of products,
the industries we serve and the countries in which we sell our products. 

Today we serve six major industries: electronics, advanced energy (solar
and fuel cells), medical device, glass, textiles and food. 

In recent years, a substantial portion of our sales originated outside the
United States, and we are geographically present directly and through distributors and trade representatives in North and Latin
America, Europe and Asia. The infrastructure upon which this diversified market approach is based, includes a newly equipped process
development laboratory, a strengthened sales organization with application engineers, an engineering team with additional talent
and the latest, most sophisticated design software tools, as well as an expanded, highly trained installation and service organization. 

The new products which we have introduced, the new markets that we have
penetrated, and the regions in which we now sell our products, are a strong foundation for our future sales growth and enhanced
profitability. 

10   

Markets   

Our diverse offerings have positioned us to provide a unique and superior
family of customized products to the six major industries that we serve. All of these systems are based on our core technology
of ultrasonic spray coating. Many of these systems have been commercially proven in 24/7 working schedules, under harsh and challenging
manufacturing environments, where they provide value in a continuous and reliable fashion. 

1.      Electronics
Industry.  

We serve this industry primarily in two sectors; Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
manufacturing and Semiconductor manufacturing. 

We provide manufacturers of PCBs with state-of-the-art solder fluxers. Spray
fluxers are used in the manufacturing process of PCBs to apply flux, which removes oxidation and prepares the PCB for the process
of soldering components onto it. 

Our ultrasonic spray fluxers reduce the amount of fluxing chemical needed,
enhance the quality of the boards, and provide our customers with a better product at reduced costs of operations, when compared
with conventional foam fluxers and pressure assisted fluxers. 

We are recognized as a standard setter in the industry and our systems are
incorporated by various original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in their manufacturing lines for the production of electronic printed
circuit boards. Some examples of products that we market to the electronics industry include: SonoFlux 2000F, SelectaFlux, SonoFlux
EZ and SonoFlux Servo. 

Pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement with EVS International Ltd
( EVS ) for the territories of the United States and Canada, we offer the EVS solder recovery system to our PCB customer
base. 

We also have a significant established customer base in the semiconductor
industry. The semi-conductor industry utilizes our ultrasonic atomizing nozzles and robotic XYZ coating platforms for the application
and deposition of photo-resist onto semiconductor wafers. Certain of our semiconductor manufacturing industry customers engaged
in the production of micro-electro-mechanical systems,  MEMS , have proven the ability of our technology to apply micron
thick coatings to these complex wafers. 

2.       Advanced Energy Industry.  

Manufacturers of solar cells and fuel cells share two major technical and
business challenges: enhancing the energy efficiency of their products and manufacturing their products in a cost effective way.
Extremely uniform, thin layer coatings are at the heart of the solution for these advanced energy systems  challenges. 

Our precision coating systems provide superior surface uniformity and density,
which are directly related to enhanced energy efficiency, compared to conventional systems. Our systems also afford our energy
industry clients with the capabilities of saving up to 80% of the expensive catalysts and nano-materials used in these manufacturing
processes. Some examples of our products marketed to the advanced energy industry include: ExactaCoat FC   SC, Sonic Syringe,
VersiCoat, and FlexiCoat FC   SC, and SonoFlow Fusion. 

11   

3.       Medical
Device Industry.  

Our ultrasonic coating technology is used by medical device manufacturers
worldwide. The leading applications for this industry are coating of arterial stents and balloon catheters with precise and uniform
micron layers of polymers and drugs; coating of various implantable devices with biomedical materials and coating of blood collection
tubes with anti-coagulants. These applications are typically performed under strict regulatory supervision of governmental agencies
in different countries, and the continuing demand for our systems from these customers is indicative of the high quality performance
that our systems provide these customers. Some examples of our products marketed to the medical device industry include: MediCoat
I; Medicoat II; Medicoat PSI; MedXT; MediCoat BCC and ExactaCoat MD. 

4.       Glass
Industry.  

The manufacture of float glass occurs under extremely harsh conditions of
elevated temperatures. Our ultrasonic coating technology provides this manufacturing process with the means to precisely and uniformly
apply anti-stain, and other specialty chemical agents, on the hot glass. Our customers benefit from an improved quality product,
enhanced productivity and significantly reduced expenditures on annual maintenance, often resulting in a return on investment of
less than one year. Based on this equipment s recent successful performance, our systems are now specified by many global
glass manufacturers as their equipment of choice. 

The equipment we offer to the glass industry is the WideTrack   wide
area modular coating system. 

5.       Advanced
Textiles Industry.  

The textiles industry is expanding the introduction of high performance
value adding coatings onto fabrics, such as anti-microbial, anti-stain, flame retardant and moisture barriers. The current manufacturing
process for applying these expensive coatings creates significant waste of material, energy and water. We are working with this
industry to incorporate our ultrasonic technology, often in combination with unique pre and post treatments of the coating materials,
to reduce the effective material and energy usage by as much as 90%. 

6.       Food Safety and Food Coatings
Industry.  

The food industry is evolving in response to greater demands for reduction
of food borne illnesses. We have successfully introduced an anti-microbial coating system for sliced packaged meats, and we are
focusing efforts on those global food companies that will need this technology to meet the new demands. We have also introduced
our systems to other segments of the food industry for the coating of flavors, ingredients and other additives of interest. Most
of our food industry equipment is designed on the WideTrack platform. 

Products  

We have core technology and have developed and market the following products: 

1.  SonoFlux 2000F   spray fluxer product   designed for high volume operations with standard width lines requiring
low maintenance using a variety of solder fluxes, including rosin flux. It is designed to be used by electronic circuit board manufacturers
to apply solder flux to fixed width circuit boards. The primary customers for the SonoFlux 2000F are original equipment manufacturers
that produce their own electronic circuit boards.   

2.  SonoFlux EZ- spray fluxer product - applies solder flux to electronic printed circuit boards that vary from two inches to up
to 18 inches in width in a cost-effective and uniform manner. They are designed to be used by either OEMs or contract manufacturers
of electronic circuit assemblies. This is an economically priced system which sells effectively to smaller manufacturers.   

12   

3.  SonoFlux Servo   a higher end spray fluxer capable of providing flux to both wide areas of a circuit board as well as
selective fluxing. We also sell a selective fluxing apparatus known as Selectaflux.   

4.  MediCoat and MediCoat II for stent coating   table-top and stand alone, fully-contained systems designed to apply thin
layers of polymer and drug coatings to arterial stents with high precision. The system incorporates motion control of the stent
during the coating process and produces coatings having excellent uniformity. The MediCoat systems use either the AccuMist or MicroMist
nozzle systems, which are precision nozzle configurations used in applications where precise patterns and coatings are required.
These products minimize waste of expensive drug polymer coatings and provide high uniformity of drug addition from stent to stent.
MediCoat II is similar to the MediCoat, but it has higher throughput capabilities more suited for a production environment. We
also sell additional medical coating platforms to address developing market segments for drug coated balloons, catheters and other
implantable devices.   

5.  WideTrack   Wide area modular coating system   designed to be used in applications that require efficient web-coating
or wide area spraying capability. One module can cover substrates from six inches to 24 inches wide, depending on the application.
Much greater widths can be achieved by linking modules together, and these systems have been applied in glass lines of up to 13
feet wide. A large number of systems have been sold over the past six years, and this application holds promise for the future
due to cost and environmental savings demonstrated at customer sites. It uses non-clogging ultrasonic atomizing nozzles to produce
a low velocity, highly controllable spray. The WideTrack System offers significant advantages over conventional pressure-spray
methods in a broad range of applications such as non-woven fabrics, float glass, or odd-shaped industrial or consumer products.
Since the ultrasonic spray can be easily controlled, it is possible to use fewer chemicals and less water and energy in applying
coatings to glass, textiles, food products and packaging materials than with traditional nozzles. This also results in reduced
environmental impact due to less overspray.   

6.  Exactacoat/Flexicoat   We offer a line of robotic XYZ coating equipment for applications involving coatings for fuel
cell membranes, solar energy panels and specialty lens products. This equipment is offered in bench-top configurations as our ExactaCoat
product and standalone as our FlexiCoat product. These platforms position and move our nozzle systems in a precise three dimensional
application pattern. These coaters are extremely efficient especially when combined with our patented ultrasonic syringe pump and
patented sonic syringe to agitate and suspend nano-particles, which are often used in our applications.   

Other Product Offerings   EVS Solder Recovery System  

We have an exclusive distribution relationship with EVS to distribute EVS s
line of solder recovery systems and spare parts in the United States and Canada. EVS manufactures the EVS 10K and EVS 8K solder
recovery systems which are used to reclaim solder from the dross which accumulates in the wave-solder equipment of circuit board
manufacturers. The customer base for distribution of these systems is synergistic with our existing customer base for spray fluxer
sales in the printed circuit board industry. 

Rental Real Estate Operations   

In December 2010, we purchased the industrial park where our facilities
are located in Milton, NY. The park is an improved 3.13 acre parcel of land comprised of five buildings of office/industrial space,
with 50,000 square feet of gross leasable floor area. We currently utilize 29,000 square feet of the park for our operations. We
presently lease 21,000 square feet of the park to unrelated third parties. 

For financial reporting purposes, we report the results of the park as rental
real estate operations.

Results of Operations   

Ultrasonic Spraying Systems Segment:   

For the six months ended August 31, 2016, our sales decreased $1,308,000
or 23% to $4,502,000 as compared to $5,811,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. During the six-month period ended August
31, 2016, we experienced decreases in sales of our Widetrack Glass Coating Units, Stent Coater Units and Servo PCB Fluxing Units.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our XYZ platform units. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2016, our sales decreased
$666,000 or 23% to $2,286,000 as compared to $2,952,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. During the three-month
period ended August 31, 2016, we experienced decreases in sales of our Widetrack Glass Coating Units, Stent Coating Units and
Servo PCB Fluxing Units. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our XYZ platform units and Solder
Recovery Systems. 

For the six  and three month periods ended August 31, 2016, sales of
our Widetrack Glass Coating Units decreased $1,272,000 and $682,000, respectively, when compared to the prior year
periods. 

Sales of our Stent Coater units, XYZ platform units, Widetrack Units and
Servo Units typically vary from quarter to quarter. Demand for our products fluctuates and is dependent upon market conditions.
The continuing expansion of our product lines has reduced our dependence on any specific market and provides us flexibility to
adapt to changing economic conditions. 

Our gross profit decreased $816,000 to $2,000,000 for the six months ended
August 31, 2016 from $2,816,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The gross profit margin was 44% of sales for the six
months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to 48% for the six months ended August 31, 2015. 

Our gross profit decreased $466,000 to $1,001,000 for the three months ended
August 31, 2016 from $1,467,000 for the three months ended August 30, 2015. The gross profit margin was 44% of sales for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to 50% for the three months ended August 31, 2015. 

The decrease in gross profit for the six months and three months ended August
31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in sales of our Widetrack units when compared to the prior year. In addition, our fixed overhead costs remained constant during the six and three months ended August 31, 2016. 

Research and product development costs were $616,000 for the six
months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $615,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. During the three months ended
August 31, 2016, research and development materials and supplies decreased when compared to the prior year period. These
decreases were offset by an increase in depreciation expense. In addition, during the three months ended August 31, 2016,
certain officer salaries were temporarily decreased. These salaries were fully reinstated effective September 1, 2016. 

Marketing and selling costs decreased $85,000 to $1,079,000 for the six
months ended August 31, 2016 from $1,164,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease is due to lower international
commission expense which was offset by increased trade show expenses. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, international
commission expense and salary expense decreased and trade show expenses increased when compared to the prior year. In addition,
during the three months ended August 31, 2016, certain officer salaries were temporarily decreased.  These salaries were fully reinstated effective September 1, 2016. 

15   

General and administrative costs decreased $42,000 to $502,000 for the
six months ended August 31, 2016 from $544,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease is due to decreased insurance
and salary expenses. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, insurance, corporate expenses, professional fees and salaries
decreased when compared to the prior year. In addition, during the three months ended August 31,
2016, certain officer salaries were temporarily decreased.  These salaries were fully reinstated effective September 1, 2016. 

Rental Real Estate Operations:   

 For the six months ended August 31, 2016, our real estate operations generated
$48,000 in rental income from unrelated third parties and incurred $45,000
in operating expenses, $36,000 in depreciation expense and $27,000 in interest expense resulting in a net loss of $60,000. The
$60,000 loss excludes any inter-company rent.  

Interest Income:   

 During the six months ended August 31, 2016, we recorded interest and investment
income of approximately $33,000 as compared to $26,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. 

Other Income:   

 During the six months ended August 31, 2016, we received a payout of $200,000
in life insurance proceeds from the death of a former employee. 

Condensed Consolidated Results:   

 We had net a net loss of $34,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2016
as compared to net income of $298,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. For the six months ended August 31, 2016, our sales
decreased $1,307,000, gross profit decreased $814,000, operating expenses decreased $122,000, and net interest/other expense increased
$266,000. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and
results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
on contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions. 

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of
significant judgments and uncertainties, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions
and conditions. The Company believes that critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. For a detailed discussion
on the application of these and other accounting policies see Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included
in Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016. 

Accounting for Income Taxes  

 As part of the process of preparing the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes. Management judgment is required in determining the
provision for the deferred tax asset. 

16   

Stock-Based Compensation  

 The computation of the expense associated with stock-based compensation
requires the use of a valuation model. ASC 718 is a complex accounting standard, the application of which requires significant
judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected
option lives, and expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. The Company currently uses a Black-Scholes
option pricing model to calculate the fair value of its stock options. The Company primarily uses historical data to determine
the assumptions to be used in the Black-Scholes model and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially
from historical data. However, changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility and future stock award exercise
experience could result in a change in the assumptions used to value awards in the future and may result in a material change to
the fair value calculation of stock-based awards. ASC 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net
income. Although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, significant unanticipated changes
in those estimates, interpretations and assumptions may result in recording stock option expense that may materially impact our
financial statements for each respective reporting period. 

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective have been deemed
to be not applicable or the adoption of such accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Company. 

17   

ITEM 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk  

The Company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or derivatives
for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted in the United States, and,
as such, are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk. All of our sales transactions are completed in US dollars. 

Although the Company's assets included $2,676,000 in cash and $1,859,000
in marketable securities, the market rate risk associated with changing interest rates in the United States is not material. 

ITEM 4   Controls
and Procedures  

The Company has established and maintains  disclosure controls
and procedures  (as those terms are defined in Rules 13a  15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Christopher L. Coccio, Chief Executive Officer (principal executive) and Stephen J. Bagley,
Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer) of the Company, have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure. 

In addition, there were no changes in the Company s internal
controls over financial reporting during the second fiscal quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.
