Note 1   Organization and Nature of Business and Basis
of Presentation  

Organization and Nature of Business   

SMG Indium Resources Ltd. (the Company) is
a corporation established pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31,
2014, the Company operated in a single-segment business, the primary business purpose of which was to stockpile indium, a specialty
metal that is being increasingly used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As
of December 31, 2014, the Company sold all of the indium held in its stockpile. As a result, the Company is no longer in the business
of purchasing and selling indium. The Company s board of directors has begun evaluating strategic options including the acquisition
of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company. In January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement
with Brack Advisors LLC (Brack), a company owned by Richard A. Biele, one of our directors, to assist the Company in identifying,
evaluating and negotiating strategic transactions, including but not limited to the acquisition of a new line of business and/or
a reverse merger. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will enter into any such transaction, and if so, on terms
favorable to the Company. 

In December 2014, the Company repurchased 6,678,358
shares of its common stock, representing 78% of its outstanding shares, in a Tender Offer (the Tender Offer) for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $16.1 million, or $2.41 per share. Shares not purchased in the Tender Offer because of proration or conditional
tenders were returned to the tendering stockholders. There were 1,883,639 shares of common stock outstanding after the Tender Offer.
During the third quarter of 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to $650 thousand of
the Company s common stock. In connection therewith, the Company repurchased 139,070 shares of its common stock in September
2015 for approximately $0.2 million, or $1.40 per share. At September 30, 2016, at the discretion of the Company s board
of directors, approximately $450 thousand remained available under the program to repurchase shares of the Company s common
stock. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 1,744,569 shares of the Company s common stock were outstanding. 

In December 2015, the Company's board of directors
approved a cash distribution to stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per common share (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution
was classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid-in
capital for accounting purposes. 

In March 2015, the Company s chief executive
officer and chief operating officer resigned and Ailon Grushkin, the Company s chairman of the board of directors and president,
was named chief executive officer. In March 2015, the Company also entered into a consulting agreement (2015 Nano Agreement) with
Nano-Cap Advisors LLC (Nano) Mr. Grushkin is the only member of Nano. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Nano Agreement, Nano provided
services normally provided by a chief executive officer of the Company, as determined and directed by the Company, and provided
office facilities for the Company. The Company paid Nano $90 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 for such services.
In January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Nano (2016 Nano Agreement) to perform the services indicated above
for an annual fee of $70 thousand in 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, we had approximately
$0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our annual cash operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.4 million while
we review our strategic options. Accordingly, we believe that we have sufficient funds to sustain operations for at least the next
twelve months. 

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying interim unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly,
these interim unaudited condensed financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements.  These interim unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the interim unaudited condensed financial statements included
herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results
of operations for the interim periods presented. The condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s
audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any interim period. 

SMG INDIUM RESOURCES LTD.  
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(Unaudited)  

Note 2   Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of the financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates relate to share-based
compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share   

The Company presents both basic and diluted
net loss per share on the face of the condensed statements of operations. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted per share calculations give
effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period, including stock options and warrants,
and using the treasury-stock method. If anti-dilutive, the effect of potentially dilutive shares of common stock is ignored. For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 382,500 and 7,313,700, respectively, potentially issuable shares of
common stock have been excluded from the calculation because their effect would be antidilutive due to the Company s net
loss. 

Income Taxes   

Income taxes are accounted under the asset-and-liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The portion of
any deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized must then be offset by recording
a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been established against all of the deferred tax assets, as it is more likely
than not that these assets will not be realized given the Company s expected operating losses. The Company recognizes the
effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions
are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are
reflected in the period in which the change in judgement occurs. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties, if any,
related to income tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes on the condensed statements of operations. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, no income taxes were recorded due to the Company s operating loss. 

Share-Based Payment Arrangements   

The Company measures the cost of employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (share-based payments, or SBP) based on the grant-date fair value of the
award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the SBP
award the requisite service period (vesting period). For SBP awards subject to conditions, compensation is not recognized
until the performance condition is probable of occurrence. The grant-date fair value of share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option-pricing model. Compensation expense for SBP awards granted to nonemployees is remeasured each period as the underlying options
vest. The Company recorded non-cash charges for SBP of approximately $0 and $1 thousand for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $9 thousand and $4 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  (continued)  

Share-Based Payment Arrangements, continued   

The fair value of each option granted during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model with the weighted average assumptions in the following table: 

The expected term of options granted represents
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility was based on the volatility in
the trading of the Company s common stock. The assumed discount rate was the default risk-free five-year interest rate provided
by Bloomberg L.P. 

Concentration of Market Risk   

The Company maintains cash deposits with banks
that at times exceed applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by
maintaining such deposits with high-quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on deposit of approximately $450 thousand in excess of federally insured limits of
$250 thousand. 

Fair Value   

The Company utilizes valuation techniques that
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines
fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous
market. For cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximated the fair values because of the immediate
or short-term nature of those instruments. 

Note 3   Stockholders 
Equity  

Common Stock   

In December 2015, the Company's board of directors
approved a cash distribution to stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per common share (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution
was classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid-in
capital for accounting purposes. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company s
board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to $650 thousand of our common stock. In connection therewith, the Company
bought back 139,070 shares of its common stock in September 2015 for approximately $0.2 million, or $1.40 per share. The cost of
such shares has been recorded as treasury stock in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, 1,744,569 shares of the Company s common stock were outstanding.       

Equity Compensation Plan   

Under the Company s 2008 Equity Incentive
Plan (the Plan), the Company may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards
and other stock-based awards. Pursuant to the Plan, 1,000,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the Plan.
Options are granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. The
terms of the options are approved by the Company s board of directors or one of its committees. Options granted to date have
vested immediately and expire in five years. At September 30, 2016, there were 617,500 options available under the Plan for future
grants.

Stock Options   

Summary stock option information is as follows: 

The weighted average grant-date fair value
was $0.03 and $0.28 for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average
remaining contractual life is approximately 4 years for stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016
and 2015, there was $3 thousand and $0 thousand, respectively, in intrinsic value of outstanding stock options. 

Note 4   Related Party Transactions  

In March 2015, the Company s chief executive
officer and chief operating officer resigned and Ailon Grushkin, the Company s chairman of the board of directors and president,
was named chief executive officer. In March 2015, the Company also entered into the 2015 Nano Agreement. Mr. Grushkin is the only
member of Nano. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Nano Agreement, Nano provided services normally provided by a chief executive
officer of the Company, as determined and directed by the Company, and provided office facilities for the Company. In January 2016,
the Company entered into the 2016 Nano Agreement under which Nano is to perform the services indicated above for an annual fee
of $70 thousand in 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid Nano $18 thousand and $23

of the Brack Agreement, Richard A. Biele is to assist the Company in identifying, evaluating and negotiating strategic transactions
including but not limited to the acquisition of a new line of business and/or a reverse merger. $13 thousand and $38 thousand,
respectively, were paid under the Brack Agreement in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. There was no such payment

Overview   

We were incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008.  From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose
was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is being increasingly used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics
manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all of the indium from our stockpile. As a result, we are no longer
in the business of purchasing and selling indium. We have begun evaluating strategic options including the acquisition of
a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company. In connection therewith, we have engaged Brack Advisors
LLC (Brack), a company owned by Richard A. Biele, one of our directors, to assist in identifying, evaluating and negotiating strategic
transactions. We have agreed to pay Brack $50 thousand in 2016 for these services. However, there can be no assurance that we will
enter into any such transaction, and if so, on terms favorable to us. 

In December 2014, we repurchased
6,678,358 shares of our common stock (representing 78% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock) in a tender offer
(the Tender Offer) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.1 million, or $2.41 per share. Shares not purchased in
the Tender Offer because of proration or conditional tenders were returned to the tendering stockholders. Shares having an aggregate
purchase price of more than approximately $16.1 million were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn. There were 1,883,639
shares of our common stock outstanding after the Tender Offer. During the third quarter of 2015, our board of directors (Board)
approved a program to repurchase up to $650 thousand in shares of our common stock. In connection therewith, we repurchased 139,070
shares of our common stock in September 2015 for approximately $0.2 million, or $1.40 per share. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, 1,744,569 shares of our common stock were outstanding. 

In December 2015, our Board
approved a cash distribution to stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per common share (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution
was classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid-in
capital for accounting purposes. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had approximately $0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our annual cash operating expenses are estimated to be approximately
$0.4 million while we review our strategic options. We believe that we have sufficient funds to sustain operations for at least
the next twelve months. 

In 2015, management services
were provided under an agreement (2015 Nano Agreement) with Nano-Cap Advisors LLC (Nano) in which Ailon Z. Grushkin, chairman of
our board of directors, president and chief executive officer, is the sole shareholder. Under the arrangement, which was approved
by our Board, we agreed to pay Nano $90 thousand in 2015 to provide management services and office space. During the first quarter
of 2016, we entered into an agreement (2016 Nano Agreement) with Nano under which Nano will continue to provide such services in
2016 for a fee of $70 thousand.  

We are not legally prohibited
from pursuing other business strategies pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or any other corporate document.
We will promptly notify stockholders of any modifications to our stated business plan. Our operations have been limited to purchasing,
stockpiling, lending or leasing the metal indium. Recently, we sold our entire indium stockpile. We have begun evaluating strategic
options including the merger or acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company, which would
require approval of our Board and will require stockholder approval. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The preparation of condensed
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   Note 2  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of the Company s
financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments: (1) Use of Estimates,
(2) Share-Based Payment Arrangements, and (3) Income Taxes. Management will base its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

Results of Operations  

The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

We had no sales in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as we sold our remaining stockpile of indium during 2014 and exited the indium
business. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were approximately $95 thousand. For the comparable three-month period in 2015,
total operating costs were approximately $133 thousand, representing a 29% decrease.  The decrease was due principally
to lower insurance expense, professional fees and manager fees. As we explore strategic initiatives, we expect that our annual
cash operating expenses will approximate $0.4 million. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, other income
decreased approximately $2 thousand when compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to less cash equivalents available for investment
in the 2016 period. We recorded no income taxes during the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 due to our operating losses. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a net loss of ($94) thousand (or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share) and ($131)
thousand (or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share), respectively. The lower operating loss was primarily due to lower operating
expenses. The basic weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was 1,744,569 in the third quarter of 2016 compared
to 1,874,569 in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in the basic weighted average shares in 2016 was due to the repurchase
of shares of common stock in 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015   

There were no sales for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as we sold our remaining stockpile of indium during 2014. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were approximately $308 thousand. For the comparable nine-month period in 2015, total
operating costs were approximately $370 thousand, representing a 17% decrease.  The decrease was due principally to lower
legal and accounting fees, director and officer insurance, manager fees, and franchise taxes in 2016. As we explore strategic initiatives,
we expect that our annual cash operating expenses will approximate $0.4 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016, other income decreased approximately $5 thousand. We recorded no income taxes during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015
due to our operating losses in that period. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately ($308) thousand or $(0.18) per basic and diluted share. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of approximately ($364) thousand or $(0.19) per basic and diluted
share. The change was due primarily to the lower operating expenses offset in part by lower interest income in the 2016 period.
The basic weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was 1,774,569 in the first nine months of 2016 compared
to 1,880,582 in the 2015 comparable period. The decrease in the basic weighted average shares in 2016 was due to the repurchase
of shares of common stock at the end of 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Since our inception and
through September 30, 2016, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million, of which approximately
$2.4 million was due to a non-cash preferential dividend to Class A Common Stockholders in 2011. At September 30, 2016, we had
working capital of approximately $631 thousand. This represents a decrease of approximately $299 thousand from the working capital
of approximately $930 thousand at December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to the net loss in the first
nine months of 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we have cash and cash equivalents of approximately $701 thousand and $960 thousand, respectively. The decrease
of approximately $259 thousand was due primarily to cash used for operations in the first nine months of 2016. We believe that
the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 should be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, which we currently estimate
to be approximately $0.4 million annually, for at least the next twelve months.  

Although we do not believe
we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business over the next year,
we may need to raise additional capital if we encounter unforeseen costs or if cash is needed for any corporate initiatives. Currently
we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of businesses,
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing.
Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We have begun evaluating strategic options including
the merger or acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company. There can be no assurances
that we will enter into any such transactions, and if so, on terms favorable to us. 

Discussion of Cash Flows   

The Company s cash
flow activity was as follows:   

Cash Flows from Operating Activities   

The net cash used in operating
activities was approximately $259 thousand in the first nine months of 2016. In the first nine months of 2015, cash used in operating
activities was approximately $489 thousand. The 2016 change is primarily due to a lower net loss in 2016 and to changes in current
assets and current liabilities between the 2016 and 2015 periods. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities   

No cash was provided by
or used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities   

No cash was provided by
or used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2016. The net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months
of 2015 was due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock under a program approved by our Board of Directors. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Transactions  

We are not party to any
off-balance-sheet transactions. 

Contractual Commitments  

We are committed to pay
Nano, a related party, $70 thousand in 2016 under the 2016 Nano Agreement, for services performed by our chief executive officer.
Further, we are committed to pay Brack, a related party, $50 thousand during 2016 for services which include identifying and negotiating
strategic transactions .  

Item 3.    Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.  

We are a smaller reporting
company and, therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our President, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in enabling us to record,
process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
within the required time period. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
