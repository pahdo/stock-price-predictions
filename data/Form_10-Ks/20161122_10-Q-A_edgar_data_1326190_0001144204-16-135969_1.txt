ARTICLE H.27.
 INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING INVESTIGATOR FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

The Institution (includes any contractor, public or private,
excluding a Federal agency) shall comply with the requirements of 45 CFR Part 94, Responsible Prospective Contractors, which promotes
objectivity in research by establishing standards to ensure that Investigators (defined as the project director or principal Investigator
and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research funded
under NIH contracts, or proposed for such funding, which may include, for example, collaborators or consultants) will not be biased
by any Investigator financial conflicts of interest. 45 CFR Part 94 is available at the following Web site:   http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr SID=0af84ca649a74846f102aaf664da1623 rgn=div5 view=text node=45:1.0.1.1.51 idno=45 .
As required by 45 CFR Part 94, the Institution shall, at a minimum: 

a.   Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforceable policy on financial conflicts of interest that complies with 45 CFR Part 94, inform
each Investigator of the policy, the Investigator's reporting responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests,
and the applicable regulation, and make such policy available via a publicly accessible Web site, or if none currently exist, available
to any requestor within five business days of a request. A significant financial interest means a financial interest consisting
of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) that
reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities:   

1.   With regard to any publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received
from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date
of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. Included are payments and equity interests;   

2.   With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received
from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the
Investigator's spouse or dependent children) holds any equity interest; or   

3.   Intellectual property rights and interests, upon receipt of income related to such rights and interest.   

Significant financial interests do not include the
following: 

1.   Income from seminars, lectures, or teaching, and service on advisory or review panels for government agencies, Institutions
of higher education, academic teaching hospitals, medical centers, or research institutes with an Institution of higher learning;
and   

2.   Income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly
control the investment decisions made in these vehicles.   

b.   Require each Investigator to complete training regarding the Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy prior to
engaging in research related to any NIH-funded contract and at least every four years. The Institution must take reasonable steps
[see Part 94.4(c)] to ensure that investigators working as collaborators, consultants or subcontractors comply with the regulations.   

c.   Designate an official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is
planning to participate in, or is participating in, the NIH-funded research.   

d.   Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the NIH-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated
official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interest (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no
later than the date of submission of the Institution's proposal for NIH- funded research. Require that each Investigator who is
participating in the NIH-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually,
in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution during the period of the award as well as within thirty
days of discovering or acquiring a new significant financial interest.   

e.   Provide guidelines consistent with the regulations for the designated official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant
financial interest is related to NIH-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial
conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research when the Institution,
thorough its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: Could be affected by the NIH-funded
research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. A financial conflict of interest exists
when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly
and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research.   

f.   Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subcontractor
Investigator. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management
plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and mitigation report pursuant to Part 94.5(a).   

g.   Provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the Contracting Officer pursuant to Part 94.5(b).   

h.   Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response
to, such disclosures, and all actions under the Institution's policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least 3 years
from the date of final payment or, where applicable, for the other time periods specified in 48 CFR Part 4, subpart 4.7, Contract
Records Retention.   

i.   Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for employee sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure Investigator
compliance as appropriate.   

j.   Complete the certification in Section K - Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors titled  Certification
of Institutional Policy on Financial Conflicts of Interest .   

If the failure of an Institution to comply with an Institution's
financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct,
or reporting of the NIH-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the corrective action
taken or to be taken. The Contracting Officer will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action or refer the
matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity
in the NIH- funded research project. 

The Contracting Officer and/or HHS may inquire at any time before,
during, or after award into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests, and the Institution's review of, and response to,
such disclosure, regardless of whether the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interests.
The Contracting Officer may require submission of the records or review them on site. On the basis of this review of records or
other information that may be available, the Contracting Officer may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will
bias the objectivity of the NIH-funded research to such an extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution
has not managed the financial conflict of interest in accordance with Part 94.6(b). The issuance of a Stop Work Order by the Contracting
Officer may be necessary until the matter is resolved. 

If the Contracting Officer determines that NIH-funded clinical
research, whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, has been designed,
conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of interest that was not managed or reported by the Institution,
the Institution shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation
of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations.

STATEMENT OF WORK 

1.1    Research and Technical Objectives  

The research and technical objectives of this proposal are: 

1.  To assess two unique approaches to heat stabilize an rPA/Alhydrogel vaccine and downselect to one approach based on thermal
stability and immunopotency data   

a.  rPA-V1: rPA/Alhydrogel stabilized and freeze dried together   

b.  rPA-V2: rPA stabilized for freeze drying separate from Alhydrogel and the Alhydrogel formulated in a buffer system suitable
for use as reconstitution solution   

2.  To develop an innovative delivery platform (dual-chamber syringe) and produce engineering lot material for use in preclinical
studies   

3.  To compare efficacy and immunogenicity of the lyophilized vaccine candidate to the currently licensed anthrax vaccine, AVA,
in NZW rabbits   

4.  To determine that the selected heat stabilized dual chamber syringe product candidate is safe in a repeated-dose rat toxicology
study   

5.  To produce cGMP heat stabilized dual chamber syringe final drug product for non-clinical and clinical testing   

6.  To confirm that the selected heat stabilized dual chamber syringe final drug product is safe and well-tolerated in humans in
a Phase 1 clinical trial   

1.2    Technical Approach and Method  

We believe that the technical and delivery platform to be utilized
in this proposal will result in a heat stable, single unit dose anthrax vaccine that significantly improves the ease and accuracy
of delivery and simplifies the logistics of transporting and stockpiling the product. 

This section describes the proposed technical plan and approach
that has been devised to deliver the overall project goals to develop the vaccine up to and including a Phase 1 clinical trial.
The planned approach contains a series of decision points at which a go/no go/redirect assessment can be made within the plan prior
to moving forward with additional development activities. 

Demonstration and Development Manufacturing of rPA-V1 and rPA-V2 . Development lots of both vaccine candidates will be
manufactured using cGMP BDS produced under BARDA contract #HHSO1002900103C and assessed for thermal stability and immunopotency
using established stability indicating assays. A downselect to a single product candidate will occur based on 6 month stability
data obtained from the developmental manufacturing material.   

Process Development, Engineering Manufacturing, and NZW Rabbit Immunogenicity and Efficacy Study . The selected approach
will move forward into process development in the dual-chambered syringe, followed by non-cGMP engineering lot manufacture and
stability testing. For NIAID programmatic purposes, a standard vaccine immunogenicity study followed by aerosol spore challenge
in the NZW rabbit has been planned to compare the selected lyophilized vaccine candidate with the currently licensed anthrax vaccine,
AVA. A Pre-IND meeting will also be held with FDA to gain concurrence for the preclinical and clinical plan. Survival and TNA data
from the NZW rabbit study indicating that the lyophilized vaccine candidate is at least equivalent to the response following AVA
immunization and successful completion of engineering lot testing and release would allow the program to proceed to cGMP manufacturing
and the planned GLP toxicology study.   

cGMP Manufacturing and IND-enabling Toxicology Testing . A clinical lot of cGMP FDP will be manufactured using cGMP BDS
produced under BARDA contract #HHSO1002900103C and placed on stability for the planned Phase 1 clinical study. Engineering lot
FDP will be used to initiate and complete a rodent pre-clinical toxicology study. The successful release of the cGMP clinical lot
as well as successful completion and final report of the toxicology study will allow PharmAthene to initiate the Phase 1 clinical
trial.   

Phase 1 Clinical Trial . A small Phase 1 clinical trial will be performed following the successful IND submission to
assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the dual-chambered vaccine compared to AVA. There is no decision point associated
with the option as it concludes the program; however, the objective is to demonstrate successful clinical proof-of-concept results
for the candidate vaccine for future development.

INVOICE/FINANCING REQUEST AND CONTRACT
FINANCIAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR NIH COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, NIH(RC)-4  

Format : Submit payment requests on the Contractor's self-generated
form in the manner and format prescribed herein and as illustrated in the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. Standard Form 1034,
Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, may be used in lieu of the Contractor's self-generated form provided
it contains all of the information shown on the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. DO NOT include a cover letter with the payment
request. 

Number of Copies : Submit payment requests in the quantity
specified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. 

Frequency : Payment requests shall not be submitted more
frequently than once every two weeks in accordance with the Allowable Cost and Payment Clause incorporated into this contract.
Small business concerns may submit invoices/financing requests more frequently than every two weeks. 

Cost Incurrence Period : Costs incurred must be within
the contract performance period or covered by precontract cost provisions. 

Billing of Costs Incurred : If billed costs include (1)
costs of a prior billing period, but not previously billed, or (2) costs incurred during the contract period and claimed after
the contract period has expired, the Contractor shall cite the amount(s) and month(s) in which the costs were incurred. 

Contractor's Fiscal Year : Prepare payment requests in
such a manner that the Government can identify costs claimed with the Contractor's fiscal year. 

Currency : All NIH contracts are expressed in United States
dollars. When the Government pays in a currency other than United States dollars, billings shall be expressed, and payment by the
Government shall be made, in that other currency at amounts coincident with actual costs incurred. Currency fluctuations may not
be a basis of gain or loss to the Contractor. Notwithstanding the above, the total of all invoices paid under this contract shall
not exceed the United States dollars authorized. 

Costs Requiring Advance Approval : Costs requiring advance
approval by the Contracting Officer, which are not set forth in the Contract Schedule shall be identified by the Contracting Officer's
Authorization (COA) Number as a separate expenditure category on the payment request. In addition, the Contractor shall show any
cost limitation or ceiling set forth in the Contract Schedule, i.e. an Advance Understanding, as a separate expenditure category
on the payment request. 

Invoice/Financing Request Identification : Identify each
payment as either: 

(a)   Interim Invoice/Contract Financing Request : These are interim payment requests submitted during the contract performance
period.   

(b)   Completion Invoice : Submit the completion invoice promptly upon completion of the work, but no later than one year from
the contract completion date, or within 120 days after settlement of the final indirect cost rates covering the year in which the
contract is physically complete (whichever date is later). The Contractor shall submit the completion invoice when all costs have
been assigned to the contract and all performance provisions have been completed.   

(c)   Final Invoice : A final invoice may be required after the amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the
Contractor (e.g., resolution of all suspensions and audit exceptions).   

Preparation and Itemization of the Invoice/Financing Request: 

The Contractor shall furnish the information set forth in the
instructions below. The instructions are keyed to the entries on the Sample Invoice/Financing Request.   All information must
be legible or the invoice will be considered improper and returned to the Contractor  . 

(a)   Designated Billing Office Name and Address : Enter the designated billing office name and address, as identified in the
Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule.   

(b)   Contractor's Name, Address, Point of Contact, TIN, and DUNS or DUNS+4 Number : Show the Contractor's name and address
exactly as they appear in the contract. Any invoice identified as improper will be sent to this address. Also include the name,
title, phone number, and e-mail address of the Point of Contact in case of questions. If the remittance name differs from the legal
business name, both names must appear on the invoice. Provide the Contractor's Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and
Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) or DUNS+4 number. The DUNS number must identify the Contractor's name and address exactly
as stated in the contract, and as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.   

When an approved assignment of claims has been executed,
the Contractor shall provide the same information for the assignee as is required for the Contractor (i.e., name, address, point
of contact, TIN, and DUNS number), with the remittance information clearly identified as such. 

(c)   Invoice/Financing Request Number : Identify each payment request by a unique invoice number, which can only be used one
time regardless of the number of contracts or orders held by an organization. For example, if a contractor has already submitted
invoice number 05 on one of its contracts or orders, it cannot use that same invoice number on any other contract or order. Payment
requests with duplicate invoice numbers will be considered improper and returned to the contractor.   

The NIH does not prescribe a particular numbering
format but suggests using a job or account number for each contract and order followed by a sequential invoice number (example:
8675309-05). Invoice numbers are limited to 30 characters. There are no restrictions on the use of special characters, such as
colons, dashes, forward slashes, or parentheses. 

If all or part of an invoice is suspended and the
contractor chooses to reclaim those costs on a supplemental invoice, the contractor may use the same unique invoice number followed
by an alpha character, such as  R  for revised (example: 8675309-05R).

date of the contract.   

(h)   Total Estimated Cost of Contract/Order : Insert the total estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of fee. If billing
under an order, insert the total estimated cost of the order, exclusive of fee. For contracts/orders with options or incremental
funding provisions, enter the amount currently obligated and available for payment.   

(i)   Total Fixed-Fee : Insert the total fixed-fee (where applicable). For contracts/orders with options or incremental funding
provisions, enter the amount currently obligated and available for payment (where applicable).  Note :  If the contract
provides for another type of Fee, i.e. Award or Incentive Fee, insert the amount available to be earned as identified in the contract
and indicate the type of fee to be billed on the payment request .   

(j)   Two-Way/Three-Way Match : Identify whether payment is to be made using a two-way or three-way match. To determine required
payment method, refer to the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule.

(o)   Amount Billed - Cumulative : Insert the cumulative amounts claimed by major cost element, including any adjustments and
fee. If the Contract Schedule contains separately priced line items, identify the contract line item(s) on the payment request
and include a separate breakdown (by major cost element) for each line item.   

(p)   Direct Costs : Insert the major cost elements. For each element, consider the application of the paragraph entitled  Costs
Requiring Prior Approval  on page 1 of these instructions.   

1)   Direct Labor : Include salaries and wages paid (or accrued) for direct performance of the contract.   

For Level of Effort contracts only, the Contractor
shall provide the following information on a separate sheet of paper attached to the payment request:

(b)  Further, the Contractor shall take or cause to be taken additional safety measures as the Contracting Officer, in conjunction
with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative or other appropriate officials, determines to be reasonably necessary.
If compliance with these additional safety measures results in an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for performance
of any part of work under this contract, the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in accordance with the applicable
 Changes  clause set forth in this contract.   

(c)  The Contractor shall maintain an accurate record of, and promptly report to the Contracting Officer, all accidents or incidents
resulting in the exposure of persons to toxic substances, hazardous materials or hazardous operations; the injury or death of any

cited by any Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agency. The report shall include a copy of the notice of violation
and the findings of any inquiry or inspection, and an analysis addressing the impact these violations may have on the work remaining
to be performed. The report shall also state the required action(s), if any, to be taken to correct any violation(s) noted by the
Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agency and the time frame allowed by the agency to accomplish the necessary corrective
action.   

(d)  If the Contractor fails or refuses to comply with the Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agency's directive(s)
regarding any violation(s) and prescribed corrective action(s), the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part
of the work until satisfactory corrective action (as approved by the Federal, State or local regulatory/enforcement agencies) has
