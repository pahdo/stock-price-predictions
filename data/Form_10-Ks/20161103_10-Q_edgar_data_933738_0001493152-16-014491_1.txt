   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ENGlobal Corporation (which may be referred to as  ENGlobal, 
the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, these condensed financial statements do not
include all of the information or note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Therefore these condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
for the year ended December 26, 2015, included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  

The
condensed financial statements included herein are unaudited for the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015, and in the case of the condensed balance sheet as of December 26, 2015, have been derived from the audited
financial statements of the Company. These financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments),
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the results for the periods presented.  

The
Company has assessed subsequent events through the date of filing of these condensed financial statements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and believes that the disclosures made herein are adequate to make the information presented herein not
misleading.  

As
we had no items of other comprehensive income in any period presented, no other components of comprehensive income or comprehensive
income are presented.  

The
Company s accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A summary of our critical accounting policies is disclosed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

In
the second quarter of 2016, the Company corrected the presentation of the proceeds of the Notes Receivable that affected the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2015. Proceeds from Notes Receivable of $6.1 million were classified as a component of Cash Flows
from Financing Activities when the proper classification should have been as a component of Cash Flows from Investing Activities.
Management has evaluated the reclassification from both a quantitative and qualitative impact and has determined that this reclassification
was not material to previously released financial statements. This reclassification had no impact on income or loss from operations,
the balance sheet or the net cash generated or used for any period.  

Each
of our quarters is comprised of 13 weeks, which includes two 4-week months and one 5-week month (4-5-4 calendar quarter).

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Changes
in Accounting    

In
April 2015, the Financial Standards Accounting Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. 
This amendment requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. This pronouncement
is effective for interim and annual financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted
this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and because the Company did not have any debt outstanding at fiscal year-end
2015 or any interim reporting period to date in 2016, this pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company s financial
statements or related disclosures.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Topic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement
of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  This amendment allows for the deferral and presentation
of debt issuance costs as an asset to be ratably amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether
there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company has historically accounted for its debt issuance
costs related to revolving credit agreements in accordance with this amendment and therefore this pronouncement did not have an
impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  that will supersede most
of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This
new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity s
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-12 to clarify certain narrow aspects of Topic 606 such as assessing the collectability criterion, presentation
of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications at transition,
completed contracts at transition, and other technical corrections. This new accounting standard, as updated, is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement
will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , that will amend the accounting standards for leases.
This new standard retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases but the primary change is the recognition
of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases on the lessee s balance
sheet and certain aspects of lease accounting have been simplified. This new standard requires additional qualitative and quantitative
disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users
of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This pronouncement is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early application permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.

TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , to change several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including a
requirement to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This pronouncement
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Varying
transition methods (modified retrospective, retrospective or prospective) are applied to different provisions of the standard.
We are currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments.  This amendment addresses how certain specified cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement
of cash flows. This guidance becomes effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We
are currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

NOTE
2   CONTRACTS   

Costs,
estimated earnings and billings on uncompleted contracts consisted of the following at September 24, 2016 and December 26, 2015
(amounts in thousands):  

Revenue
on fixed-price contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion (cost-to-cost) method. Revenue and gross margin
on fixed-price contracts are subject to revision throughout the lives of the contracts and any required adjustments are made in
the period in which the revisions become known. To manage unknown risks, management may use contingency amounts to increase the
estimated costs, therefore, lowering the earned revenues until the risks are better identified and quantified or have been mitigated.
We currently have $0.6 million in contingency amounts as of September 24, 2016 compared to $2.4 million as of December 26, 2015.
Losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are identified. Fixed price contracts generally include retainage provisions
under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by our customer.
We currently have $3.5 million in retainage as of September 24, 2016 compared to $6.9 million as of December 26, 2015.

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

We
recognize service revenue as soon as the services are performed. For clients that we consider higher risk, due to past payment
history or history of not providing written work authorizations, we defer revenue recognition until we receive either written
authorization or payment. We currently have $0.1 million in deferred revenue recognition as of September 24, 2016 compared to
$0.1 million as of December 26, 2015. This deferred revenue represents work on not to-exceed contracts that has been performed
but has not been billed or booked as revenue due to our revenue recognition policies as the work was performed outside the contracted
amount without obtaining proper work order changes. It is uncertain as to whether these revenues will eventually be recognized
by us or the proceeds collected. The costs associated with these billings have been expensed as incurred.  

NOTE
3   LINE OF CREDIT AND LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITIES   

Line
of Credit Facility    

On
September 16, 2014, we entered into a three year Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Regions Bank
( Lender ) pursuant to which the Lender agreed to extend credit to us in the form of revolving loans of up to the
lesser of $10.0 million (the  Commitment ) or the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement
includes a sub-facility for standby and / or trade letters of credit up to an amount not to exceed $2.5 million. There were no
loans outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of September 24, 2016 or December 26, 2015. On June 16, 2016, but effective May
29, 2016, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement ( Second Amendment ) with the Lender pursuant
to which the Company is not required to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant from the fiscal month ending
April 30, 2016 through the fiscal month ending December 31, 2016, provided that the Company is not permitted to have any obligations
or borrowings related to working capital outstanding and the Company is required to retain a cash balance of at least $5.0 million
in collection accounts with the Lender. In effect, this prohibits the Company from borrowing any material amount under the Loan
Agreement until the Company is able to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio.  

Borrowing
Base:   The Borrowing Base is an amount equal to the sum of (a) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Cost Plus Contract
Amounts, plus (b) the lesser of (i) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Fixed Price Contract Accounts or (ii) $2,500,000,
plus (c) the lesser of (i) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Government Contract Accounts or (ii) $1,000,000, plus
(d) the lesser of (i) 75% of the total amount of Eligible Unbilled Accounts or (ii) total revenues from all Accounts over the
preceding 30-day period, provided that to the extent that any Eligible Unbilled Accounts consist of Accounts that would be Eligible
Approved Government Contracts and be included in provision (c) above if billed there shall be a limitation in eligibility thereof
under this provision (d) of $800,000, plus (e) 75% of the total amount of Eligible Costs in Excess of Billings, and minus (f)
such amounts as may be required by Lender to be reserved at any time and from time to time.  

Interest:
  Any loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Index Rate plus 2.25%. If the loan is converted to
a Base Rate Loan, then such loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (defined as a rate per annum equal
to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, (b) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, or (c)
a per annum rate equal to LIBOR determined with respect to an interest period of one month plus 1.00%) plus 1.25%.  

Collateral:
  All obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority perfected lien against any and
all personal property assets of the Company (other than certain excluded property).

Term :
 All loans and all other obligations outstanding under the Loan Agreement shall be payable in full on September 14, 2017, unless
otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.  

Material
Covenants:   The Loan Agreement requires the Company to comply with various financial, affirmative and negative covenants
affecting its businesses and operations, including:  

The
    Company will not be a party to mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, reorganizations or similar transactions.   

The
    Company will not sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets (subject to certain exceptions
    set forth in the Loan Agreement).   

The
    Company will not declare, pay or make any dividend or distribution on any shares of common or preferred stock or make any
    cash payment to repurchase or otherwise retire any common or preferred stock, provided that the Company may repurchase up
    to $2.0 million of its common stock pursuant to its announced stock repurchase plan, subject to certain conditions.   

The
    fixed charge coverage ratio must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00.    

The
    Company will not permit capital expenditures during any fiscal year to exceed $3.5 million.   

The
Company was in compliance with all of the material covenants of the Loan Agreement as of September 24, 2016 other than the fixed
charge coverage ratio, for which compliance is not required from the fiscal month ending April 30, 2016 through the fiscal month
ending December 31, 2016, as described above.

NOTE
5   FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification 740 ( ASC 740 )
for interim reporting periods. Under ASC 740-270, we estimate an annual effective income tax rate based on year-to-date operating
results and our projection of operating results for the remainder of the year. We apply this projected annual effective income
tax rate to the year-to-date operating results to accrue for income taxes. If actual operating results differ from the annual
projection, our estimated annual effective income tax rate can change affecting income tax expense for successive interim results
as well as the estimated annual income tax expense results. Certain state taxes are not included in the calculation of the estimated
annual effective income tax rate because the underlying basis for such state taxes is related to revenues and not taxable income.
Amounts related to Texas margin taxes are reported as income tax expense.  

The
Company applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. The accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes prescribes that tax benefits are only recognized when there is a greater than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained
upon examination by the taxing authorities. Management has reviewed the Company s tax positions and determined there are
no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the financial statements. U.S. federal tax returns prior to 2012 and Texas
margins tax returns prior to 2012 are closed. Generally, the applicable statutes of limitations are three to four years from their
filings.  

The
Company recorded income tax benefits of $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016,
respectively, compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 26,
2015, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was (45.8)% and 36.2% for the three and nine months ended September
24, 2016, respectively, as compared to 17.3% and 10.2% for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015, respectively. The
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily
due a change in the operating results from net income to net loss, non-deductible items, foreign withholding tax expense, the
true-up of prior year income tax accruals to our filed returns and a change in our blended income state tax rate.  

NOTE
6   STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

Forward-Looking Statements    

Certain information contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time
to time by the Company and its representatives in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases,
conferences or otherwise, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. This information includes, without limitation, statements concerning the Company s future financial position
and results of operations, planned capital expenditures, business strategy and other plans for future operations, the future mix
of revenues and business, customer retention, project reversals, commitments and contingent liabilities, future demand and industry

can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Generally, the words
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   may  and similar expressions,
identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Actual results could differ materially from
the results described in the forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, the specific risk factors identified in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26,
2015, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The following discussion
is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements,
including the notes thereto, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 26, 2015. 

Overview    

ENGlobal Corporation (which
may be referred to as  ENGlobal,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ),
incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 1994, is a leading provider of engineering and professional services principally to
the energy industry through two segments: Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management ( EPCM ) and Automation
Engineering and Integrated Products ( Automation ). The Company has recently expanded its service offerings to include
the fabrication of certain components that it engineers at a 31 acre fabrication facility located in Henderson, Texas. While this
additional service will allow the Company to potentially capture more project scope in the near term, the primary purpose for adding
this service, in addition to our current engineering, automation and integration services, is to provide a differentiated, lower
cost alternative for highly engineered modularized systems and thereby providing higher value to our clients. 

Results of Operations    

The majority of the Company s
EPCM services have historically been provided through time-and-material contracts and a majority of the Company s engineered
automation system revenues are provided through fixed-price contracts. In the course of providing our services, we routinely provide
materials and equipment and may provide construction or construction management services on a subcontractor basis. Generally, these
materials, equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed, along with handling fees, which
in general are at margins lower than those of our normal core business. In accordance with industry practice and generally accepted
accounting principles, all such costs and fees are included in revenue. The use of subcontractor services can change significantly
from project to project; therefore, changes in revenue and gross profit, SG A expense and operating income as a percentage
of revenue may not be indicative of the Company s core business trends. Segment operating SG A expense includes management,
business development and staff compensation, office costs such as rents and utilities, depreciation, amortization, travel, bad
debt and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts, but directly related to the support of a segment s
operations. Corporate SG A expenses include finance, accounting, human resources, legal and information technology which are
unrelated to specific projects but which are incurred to support corporate activities.

ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Revenue     Revenues
decreased $2.2 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the three ended September 26, 2015. EPCM segment
revenues decreased $3.7 million for the current quarterly period as compared to the prior year quarterly period largely due to
the completion of projects and the decline in our clients  activities which has reduced the number of new projects. Automation
segment revenues increased $1.5 million for the current quarterly period as compared to the prior year quarterly period driven
largely by an increased volume of higher valued fixed-price projects. 

Revenues decreased $17.7
million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015. Year to date revenues
for both the EPCM and Automation segments have been negatively impacted by the sustained reduction in oil and gas prices and the
resulting drop in our clients  activities in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry. EPCM
segment revenues decreased $13.2 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior
year period primarily due to the completion of projects and the decline in our clients  activities which has reduced the
number of new projects. Automation segment revenues decreased $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016
as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to $3.1 million of revenue from the oil and gas upstream sector for
the comparable prior year period that did not repeat this year and the decline in our clients  activities. 

Recognizing the implications
of declining oil prices in 2015, we have taken steps to mitigate and reverse the declining revenue trends. In the latter half of
2015, we hired three seasoned business development professionals and another in the first quarter of 2016. While it will require
time for these efforts to generate revenue, our proposal activity has increased and our backlog has remained steady even though
the time from proposal to award has increased. While the cost of these initiatives is immediately reflected in increased SG A
expense, we expect to recognize the benefits of these efforts over time subject to the overall level of spending in the energy
sectors in which we provide services. 

Gross Profit  
   Gross profit increased $0.1 million for the
three months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 26, 2015 comprised of a $0.4 million increase
in the Automation segment s gross profit partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in the EPCM segment s gross profit.
During the lives of fixed-priced contracts, we may maintian certain contingency amounts to manage the unknown risks on the
related projects. These amounts may be removed as risks are better identified and quantified or mitigated. We removed $0.8 million
of contingency amounts from fixed price contracts during the three months ended September 24, 2016 compared to $0.5 million during
the three months ended September 26, 2015. Gross profit margins for the current quarterly period improved to 24.3% of revenues
as compared to 20.7% of revenues for the prior year quarterly period primarily due to the removal of contingency amounts
on fixed-priced projects during the three months ended September 24, 2016 and lower variable labor operating costs in both
the EPCM and Automation segments. Lower variable labor operating costs were primarily due to higher manpower utilization, which
decreased the Company s variable labor operating costs to 4.4% of revenues for the current quarterly period from 7.4% of
revenues for the prior year quarterly period. In the second quarter, we initiated cost savings measures by introducing a furlough
program and reducing our payroll burden. We have also taken additional steps in the third quarter by limiting hours spent on indirect
activities. We expect these measures to positively impact our gross profit margins for future periods. Additionally, we intend
to monitor labor utilization for both the EPCM and the Automation segments with the goal of improving gross profit margins while
remaining positioned for a potential rebound and growth in future periods.

ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Gross profit decreased
$5.1 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period due to a $3.0 million
decrease and a $2.1 million decrease in the EPCM and Automation segments  gross profit, respectively. During the lives
of fixed-priced contracts, we may maintain certain contingency amounts to manage the unknown risks on the related projects. These
amounts may be removed as risks are better identified and quantified or mitigated. We removed $0.8 million of contingency amounts
from fixed-priced contracts during the nine months ended September 24, 2016 compared to $0.6 million during the nine months ended
September 26, 2015. Gross profit margins declined to 16.6% for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 from 20.0% in the
comparable prior year period due to higher variable labor operating costs and the decline in our clients  activities which
has reduced the number of new projects, partially offset by the removal of contingency amounts on fixed-priced projects
during the nine months ended September 24, 2016. We incurred higher variable labor operating costs in both the EPCM and Automation
segments due to lower manpower utilization which increased the Company s variable labor operating costs to 8.0% of revenues
for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 compared to 6.3% of revenues for the comparable prior year period due to the completion
of projects and the decline in the number of new projects. As discussed previously, in the second and third quarters we have initiated
cost saving measures and other actions with the goal of improving gross profit margins while remaining positioned for a potential
rebound and growth in future periods. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expense     Overall our SG A expense increased by $0.2 million and decreased by $0.7 million
for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016, respectively, as compared to last year s periods. While we have made
a significant investment in strategic business development resources this year, totaling approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million
for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016, respectively, we have more than offset this investment by reducing our
IT, facility, contract services and depreciation and amortization costs, and we continue to look for ways to streamline our processes
and delay expenditures while we continue to invest in our business development activities. 

Other Income (Expense),
net     Other income decreased by $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to the nine
months ended September 26, 2015 primarily because the prior year period benefitted from the collection and recognition of a $0.6
million gain on a notes receivable that had been fully reserved for. 

Interest Expense,
net     Our interest expense was less than $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016, and
for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015. Our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital leases,
amortization of the cost of entering into the Loan Agreement and commitment fees and other fees associated with the Loan Agreement.
We currently have no loans outstanding under our Loan Agreement. 

Tax Expense    
The Company recorded income tax benefits of $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016,
respectively, compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September
26, 2015, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was (45.8)% and 36.2% for the three and nine months ended September
24, 2016, respectively, as compared to 17.3% and 10.2% for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015, respectively. The
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily
due a change in the operating results from net income to net loss, non-deductible items, foreign withholding tax expense, the true-up
of prior year income tax accruals to our filed returns and a change in our blended income state tax rate. 

Net Income    
Net income increased $0.2 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September
26, 2015 primarily as a result of lower operating costs and SG A expenses resulting from our cost saving measures partially
offset by lower revenues and income tax benefits. The Company s net loss increased $3.8 million for the nine months ended
September 24, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015 as a result of lower revenues and gross profit,
partially offset by lower SG A expenses.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Liquidity and
Capital Resources Overview    

Overview   

The Company defines liquidity
as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations. Our primary
sources of liquidity are internally generated funds as our Loan Agreement with Regions Bank does not presently provide us with
any meaningful availability. We had cash of approximately $16.1 million at September 24, 2016, and $7.8 million as of December
26, 2015. Our working capital as of September 24, 2016 was $22.2 million as compared to $25.6 million at December 26, 2015. We
believe our current cash on hand and other working capital are sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. Cash and the availability
of cash could be materially restricted if (1) outstanding invoices billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner,
(2) circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices, (3) we lose one or more of our major customers, or (4) we
are unable to win new projects that we can perform on a profitable basis. Actions outside of our control may hinder or preclude
the collection of these receivables. 

Cash Flows from Operating
Activities   

Operating activities generated
$9.8 million in cash for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September
26, 2015. The primary drivers of our increase in cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 were
increases in collections of trade receivables, cost in excess of billings and prepaid expenses and other current assets offset
by a net loss of $1.9 million and decreases in billings in excess of costs. 

Cash Flows from Investing
Activities   

Investing activities used
cash of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to generating cash of $5.2 million for the nine
months ended September 26, 2015. Collections from notes receivable generated $6.1 million in proceeds in the nine months ended
September 26, 2015. Expenditures for property and equipment were $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as
compared to $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2015. Expenditures for property and equipment for full year 2016
are budgeted to be approximately $0.5 million. Our Loan Agreement limits our annual capital expenditures to $3.5 million. 

Cash Flows from Financing
Activities   

Financing activities used
cash totaling approximately $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to $0.5 million for the nine
months ended September 26, 2015. The primary uses of cash during the nine months ended September 24, 2016 were $1.1 million for
the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Company s stock repurchase program and $0.2 million for payment of obligations
under capital leases during the nine months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to $0.5 million for payment of obligations under
capital leases during the nine months ended September 26, 2015.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Line of Credit Facility   

On September 16, 2014,
we entered into a three year Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Regions Bank ( Lender )
pursuant to which the Lender agreed to extend credit to us in the form of revolving loans of up to the lesser of $10.0 million
(the  Commitment ) or the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement includes a sub-facility
for standby and / or trade letters of credit up to an amount not to exceed $2.5 million. There were no loans outstanding under
the Loan Agreement as of September 24, 2016 or December 26, 2015. On June 16, 2016, but effective May 29, 2016, we entered into
the Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement ( Second Amendment ) with the Lender pursuant to which the Company is not
required to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant from the fiscal month ending April 30, 2016 through
the fiscal month ending December 31, 2016, provided that the Company is not permitted to have any obligations or borrowings related
to working capital outstanding and the Company is required to retain a cash balance of at least $5.0 million in collection accounts
with the Lender. In effect, this prohibits the Company from borrowing any material amount under the Loan Agreement until after
the fiscal month ended December 31, 2016 and the Company is able to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio. 

Borrowing Base:  
The Borrowing Base is an amount equal to the sum of (a) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Cost Plus Contract Amounts,
plus (b) the lesser of (i) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Fixed Price Contract Accounts or (ii) $2,500,000, plus
(c) the lesser of (i) 85% of the total amount of Eligible Approved Government Contract Accounts or (ii) $1,000,000, plus (d) the
lesser of (i) 75% of the total amount of Eligible Unbilled Accounts or (ii) total revenues from all Accounts over the preceding
30-day period, provided that to the extent that any Eligible Unbilled Accounts consist of Accounts that would be Eligible Approved
Government Contracts and be included in provision (c) above if billed there shall be a limitation in eligibility thereof under
this provision (d) of $800,000, plus (e) 75% of the total amount of Eligible Costs in Excess of Billings, and minus (f) such amounts
as may be required by Lender to be reserved at any time and from time to time. 

Interest:   Any
loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Index Rate plus 2.25%. If the loan is converted to a Base Rate
Loan, then such loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (defined as a rate per annum equal to the greatest
of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, (b) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, or (c) a per annum rate
equal to LIBOR determined with respect to an interest period of one month plus 1.00%) plus 1.25%. 

Collateral:   All
obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority perfected lien against any and all personal
property assets of the Company (other than certain excluded property). 

Term  : All
loans and all other obligations outstanding under the Loan Agreement shall be payable in full on September 14, 2017, unless otherwise
terminated pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Material Covenants:  
The Loan Agreement requires the Company to comply with various financial, affirmative and negative covenants affecting its businesses
and operations, including: 

The Company will not be a party to mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, reorganizations or similar transactions.   

The Company will not sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Loan Agreement).   

The Company will not declare, pay or make any dividend or distribution on any shares of common or preferred stock or make any cash payment to repurchase or otherwise retire any common or preferred stock, provided that the Company may repurchase up to $2 million of its common stock pursuant to its announced stock repurchase plan, subject to certain conditions.   

The fixed charge coverage ratio must not be less than 1.10 to 1.00.    

The Company will not permit capital expenditures during any fiscal year to exceed $3.5 million.   

The Company was in compliance
with all of the material covenants of the Loan Agreement as of September 24, 2016 other than the fixed charge coverage ratio, for
which compliance is not required from the fiscal month ending April 30, 2016 through the fiscal month ending December 31, 2016,
as described above. 

Stock Repurchase
Program   

On April 21, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0
million of the Company s common stock from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, based on
prevailing market conditions. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of common
stock under the repurchase program, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had
purchased 950,911 shares for an aggregate amount of $1.2 million under the repurchase program.

Critical Accounting
Policies    

A summary of our critical
accounting policies are described under the caption  Critical Accounting Policies  in Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies
are further disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Changes in Accounting   

In April 2015, the Financial
Standards Accounting Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest
- Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This amendment requires
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. This pronouncement is effective for interim and
annual financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this pronouncement in the first
quarter of fiscal 2016 and because the Company did not have any debt outstanding at fiscal year-end 2015 or any interim reporting
period to date in 2016, this pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures. 

In August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Topic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance
Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  This amendment allows for the deferral and presentation of debt issuance
costs as an asset to be ratably amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any
outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company has historically accounted for its debt issuance costs related
to revolving credit agreements in accordance with this amendment and therefore this pronouncement did not have an impact on the
Company s financial statements or related disclosures. 

New Accounting Pronouncements
Not Yet Adopted   

In May 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  that will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition
requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which
we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This new standard also requires significantly
expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 to clarify certain
narrow aspects of Topic 606 such as assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes
collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition, and
other technical corrections. This new accounting standard, as updated, is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on our financial statements and related
disclosures.

ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , that will amend the accounting standards for leases. This new standard retains
a distinction between finance leases and operating leases but the primary change is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities
by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases on the lessee s balance sheet and certain aspects of lease accounting
have been simplified. This new standard requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures along with specific quantitative
disclosures required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,
timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This pronouncement is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement
will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,
to changes several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including a requirement to recognize all excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This pronouncement is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Varying transition methods (modified retrospective,
retrospective or prospective) are applied to different provisions of the standard. We are currently evaluating the impact this
pronouncement will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This
amendment addresses how certain specified cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. This guidance
becomes effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact
the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Our financial instruments
include cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes and capital leases payable and debt obligations.
The book value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term notes payable are considered
to be representative of their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

We do not utilize financial
instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market
risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest
rates and, to a minor extent, currency exchange rates. 

Our exposure to market
risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our obligations under the Loan Agreement. As of September 24, 2016, we
had no loans outstanding under the Loan Agreement. Any future loans will accrue interest as described in Item 2,  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Line
of Credit Facility  above. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures of a registrant designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include processes to accumulate and evaluate relevant information and communicate such information to a
registrant s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 24, 2016, as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation
described above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 24, 2016, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective insofar as they are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

No changes in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the quarterly period ended September 24, 2016, that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

From time to time, ENGlobal
or one or more of its subsidiaries is involved in various legal proceedings or is subject to claims that arise in the ordinary
course of business alleging, among other things, claims of breach of contract or negligence in connection with the performance
or delivery of goods and/or services. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Certain
specific matters are discussed in Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We believe, as of the date of this filing, all such active proceedings and claims of substance that have been asserted against
ENGlobal or one or more of its subsidiaries have been adequately allowed for, or are covered by insurance, such that, if determined
adversely to the Company, individually or in the aggregate, they would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

In addition to the other
information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item
1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015, which outlines factors that could
materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, and the additional risk factors below. The risks described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015, are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our
business, financial conditions or operating results. 

Our ability to
borrow under our credit facility is limited due to a recent amendment which will limit our ability to finance operations or engage
in other business activities which could have a material impact on our financial condition.    Historically, we have relied
on credit facilities with significantly higher levels of availability to provide us with adequate working capital to operate and
expand our business. Due to a recent amendment, our credit facility, which consists of a revolving loan facility in addition to
a sub-facility for letters of credit, currently provides for no availability except as may be necessary for intraday cash management
activities and up to $0.5 million for letters of credit. In addition, we are required to maintain a cash balance of at least $5.0
million in collection accounts with the lender. The credit facility also restricts us from mergers, acquisitions, sales of assets,
and paying dividends, among other provisions which could restrict opportunities for growth. 

Our backlog is
subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenue or earnings.   
As of September 24, 2016, our backlog was approximately $35 million, including $10 million for the CPC Project. We expect
a majority of this backlog to be completed in 2016 and 2017. We cannot assure investors that the revenue projected in our backlog
will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Projects currently in our backlog may be canceled or may remain in our
backlog for an extended period of time prior to project execution and, once project execution begins, it may occur unevenly over
the current and multiple future periods. In addition, project terminations, suspensions or reductions in scope occur from time
to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog, reducing the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts
reflected in our backlog. Future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog
in addition to the revenue and profits that we actually earn. The potential for cancellations and adjustments to our backlog are
exacerbated by economic conditions, particularly in our chosen area of concentration, the energy industry. The energy industry
has experienced a precipitous decline and above normal volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices from mid-2014 through the
current date.

The CPC Project,
which represents a significant portion of our current business, involves a pipeline expansion project in Russia and Kazakhstan
along the Caspian Sea, and we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks in that geographic region that are greater
than in the United States.    The CPC Project is an engineering, procurement, and commissioning services agreement with
the Caspian Pipeline Consortium that is expected to have a total value of approximately $89 million over the life of the contract
and represents approximately $10 million of our backlog at September 24, 2016. This contract involves a pipeline expansion project
in Russia and Kazakhstan along the Caspian Sea. This region, specifically Russia, has undergone significant political, economic
and social change in recent years, and the risk of unforeseen changes in this region may be greater than in the United States.
For example, Russia and the Ukraine are experiencing significant unrest, which has involved, among other things, Russia s
annexation of the Crimean region of Ukraine in 2014. As a result, economic sanctions by the U.S., United Nations and other countries
remain in place against Russia, and additional sanctions are possible as the situation continues in 2016. In addition, changes
in laws or regulations, including with respect to payment of service providers, taxation, transportation, information technology,
data transmission and the Internet, or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government
or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our ability to perform under the CPC Project and, thus, our business, operating
results and financial condition. While we do not believe that the possibility of a continued armed conflict with respect to Russia
and Ukraine will affect the region in which we perform services under the CPC Project, conducting and expanding our international
operations through the CPC Project subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the United States. These include: 

Difficulties in managing the staffing of our international operations, including hiring and retaining qualified employees and transportation of employees to and from the region;   

Difficulties and increased expense introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations;   

Increased expense to comply with foreign laws and legal standards, including laws that regulate pricing and promotion activities and the import and export of information technology, which can be difficult to monitor and are often subject to change;   

Increased expense to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;   

Longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;   

Political, social and economic instability; and   

Expropriation of assets by foreign governments.   

The occurrence of one or
more of these events could negatively affect our operations under the CPC Project and, consequently, our operating results. Further,
operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources, and we cannot be certain
that the resources required to perform our services under the CPC Project in these other countries will produce desired levels
of revenue or profitability. 

If we are unable
to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Our business depends
on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed and materials supplied.
In the ordinary course of business, we extend unsecured credit to our customers. We may also agree to allow our customers to defer
payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed, and customers typically
withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage. For example, as of September 24, 2016, our customer for the CPC project
had $3.5 million in retainage. We bear the risk that our clients will pay us late or not at all. Though we evaluate and attempt
to monitor our clients  financial condition, there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess their creditworthiness.
To the extent the credit quality of our clients deteriorates or our clients seek bankruptcy protection, our ability to collect
receivables and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if our clients are credit-worthy, they may delay payments
in an effort to manage their cash flow. Financial difficulties or business failure experienced by one or more of our major customers
has had and could, in the future, continue to have a material adverse effect on both our ability to collect receivables and our
results of operations.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS
