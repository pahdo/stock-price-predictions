   GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      (Unaudited)       (1) Background       The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of General Mills, Inc. (we, us, our, General Mills, or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting on Form  10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not include certain information and disclosures required for comprehensive
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature, including the elimination of all intercompany transactions and any
noncontrolling and redeemable interests  share of those transactions. Operating results for the quarter ended November 27, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending May 28,
2017.      These statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report
on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016. The accounting policies used in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those described in Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in that Form  10-K.  Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in the  Glossary  section below.       (2) Divestitures       During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our Martel, Ohio
manufacturing facility in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment and simultaneously entered into a  co-packing  arrangement with the purchaser. We received $17.5 million in cash, and recorded a
 pre-tax  loss of $13.5 million.      During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our North
American Green Giant product lines for $822.7 million in cash, and we recorded a  pre-tax  gain of $199.1 million. We received net cash proceeds of $788.0 million after transaction-related costs.
After the divestiture, we retained a brand intangible asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $30.1 million related to our continued use of the  Green Giant  brand in certain markets outside of North America.

    (3) Restructuring Initiatives       We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key growth strategies. Charges related to these activities were
as follows:       
    In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we notified the employees and their representatives of our decision to close our
pasta manufacturing facility in Melbourne, Australia in our International segment to improve our margin structure. This action will affect approximately 350 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $34 million of net expenses relating to
this action, most of which will be  non-cash.  We recorded $12.0 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 relating to this action. We expect these actions to be completed by the
end of fiscal 2018.      In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a plan to restructure certain product lines in our International
segment. To eliminate excess capacity, we will close our snacks manufacturing facility in Mar lia, Brazil and cease production operations for meals and snacks at our facility in S o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. We will also cease
production of certain underperforming snack products at our facility in Nanjing, China. These and other actions, which are subject to appropriate consultation with employees and their representatives where required by law or practice, will affect
approximately 420 positions in our Brazilian operations and approximately 440 positions in our Greater China operations. We expect to incur approximately $46 million of net expenses of which approximately $8 million will be cash. We
recorded $6.9 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and $43.3 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 relating to this action. We expect these
actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017.      In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we approved a plan to close our Vineland, New Jersey
facility to eliminate excess soup capacity in our U.S. Retail segment. This action will affect approximately 370 positions, and we expect to   
         9   

Table of Contents  

incur approximately $66 million of net expenses, of which approximately $23 million will be cash. We recorded $7.0 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal
2017 and $27.9 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 relating to this action. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2019.   
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved Project Compass, a restructuring plan designed to enable our International segment to accelerate
long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. In connection with this project, we expect to eliminate approximately 725 to 775 positions. We expect to incur approximately $58 million of net
expenses, all of which will be cash. We recorded $1.0 million of restructuring expenses in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 relating to this action. We recorded $2.1 million of
restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and $53.6 million in the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017.
     Project Century (Century) began in fiscal 2015 and is a review of our manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and
identify potential capacity reductions. As part of Century, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we notified the employees and their representatives of our decision to close the dough and dry mix manufacturing facility in our International segment
supply chain located in Berwick, United Kingdom. This action will affect approximately 265 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $33 million of net expenses related to this action, of which $12 million will be cash. We recorded
$0.5 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and $2.0 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 relating to this action. We expect these actions to be
completed by the end of fiscal 2018.      As part of Century, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we notified the employees and their
representatives of our decision to close our pasta manufacturing facility located in East Tamaki, New Zealand in our International segment supply chain. This action affected 20 positions, and we incurred less than $1 million of net expenses
related to this action, most of which was cash. We recorded $0.4 million of restructuring charges in the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015. This action was completed in fiscal
2017.          As part of Century, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved a restructuring plan to close our cereal
and dry dinner manufacturing plant in West Chicago, Illinois in our U.S. Retail segment supply chain. This action will affect approximately 500 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $108 million of net expenses relating to this
action, of which approximately $44 million will be cash. We recorded $5.5 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and $12.9 million in the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016 relating to this action. We recorded $64.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015 relating to this action. We expect this
action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2019.      As part of Century, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved a restructuring plan
to close our snacks manufacturing facility in Joplin, Missouri in our U.S. Retail segment supply chain. This action affected approximately 120 positions, and we incurred $6.6 million of net expenses relating to this action, including
$2.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and $7.8 million in the six-month period ended November 29, 2015, of which less than $1 million was cash. This action was completed in fiscal 2016.   
  In addition, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, $13.7 million in the second quarter of
fiscal 2016, $15.2 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, and $39.0 million in the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015
relating to other Century actions previously announced.      During the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016, we paid $43.3 million in cash relating to restructuring initiatives.      In addition to restructuring charges, we
recorded $11.1 million of project-related costs in cost of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and $24.9 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016. We paid
$28.6 million in cash in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 for project-related costs. We expect to incur approximately $29.5 million of project-related costs in future periods related
to our restructuring initiatives.

   Restructuring charges and project-related costs are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as
follows:       
    The roll forward of our restructuring and other exit cost reserves, included in other current liabilities, is as follows:
      
    The charges recognized in the roll forward of our reserves for restructuring and other exit costs do not include items
charged directly to expense (e.g., asset impairment charges, the gain or loss on the sale of restructured assets, and the  write-off  of spare parts) and other periodic exit costs recognized as incurred, as
those items are not reflected in our restructuring and other exit cost reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.       (4) Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets       The components of goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:   
   
    Based on the carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets as of November 27, 2016, annual amortization expense
for each of the next five fiscal years is estimated to be approximately $27 million.

   The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal 2017 were as follows:   
   
    The changes in the carrying amount of other intangible assets during fiscal 2017 were as follows:   
   
    Our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset testing was performed on the first day of the second quarter of
fiscal 2017. As of the assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the  Immaculate Baking 
brand and the Latin America reporting unit. The excess fair value above the carrying value of this brand asset and reporting unit is as follows:       
    In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2017 assessment date, the  Progresso ,  Green
Giant  and  Food Should Taste Good  brand assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.       (5) Inventories       The components of inventories were as follows:

    (6) Risk Management Activities       Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs,
including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean),  non-fat  dry milk, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty
with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and   over-the-counter   options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our
planned cost as possible.      We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments
required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.   
  Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of
providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance, certain gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of
segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing the resulting   mark-to-market   volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.   
  Unallocated corporate items for the quarters and  six-month  periods ended November 27, 2016, and
November 29, 2015 included:       
    As of November 27, 2016, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $164.0 million, of which
$72.4 million related to energy inputs and $91.6 million related to agricultural inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.      In advance of planned debt financing, during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into $400 million and $100 million, respectively, of treasury locks
due February 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 2.0 percent.     As of November 27, 2016, the net notional value of foreign
exchange derivatives was $900.0 million.      The fair values of the derivative positions used in our risk management activities and other
assets recorded at fair value were not material as of November 27, 2016, and were Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities in the fair value hierarchy. We did not significantly change our valuation techniques from prior periods.
     We offer certain suppliers access to a third party service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party service
also allows suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct
  
         13

relationship with the suppliers, the third party, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our
supplier agreements. As of November 27, 2016, $560.2 million of our total accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize this third party service.       (7) Debt       The components of notes payable were as follows:   
   
    To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable.
Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have committed, uncommitted, and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign
operations.      The following table details the  fee-paid  committed and uncommitted credit lines we had
available as of November 27, 2016:       
    In fiscal 2016, we entered into a $2.7 billion  fee-paid  committed credit
facility that is scheduled to expire in May 2021. Concurrent with the execution of this credit facility, we terminated our $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities.      The credit facilities contain covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. We were in compliance with all credit facility covenants as of
November 27, 2016.        Long-Term Debt        The fair values and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $8,347.2 million and $8,049.6 million, respectively, as of November 27, 2016. The fair value of
long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.   
  In January 2016, we issued  500.0 million principal amount of floating-rate notes due January 15, 2020. Interest on the notes is payable
quarterly in arrears. We may redeem the notes if certain tax laws change and we would be obligated to pay additional amounts on the notes. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net
proceeds were used to repay a portion of our maturing long-term debt.      In January 2016, we repaid $250 million of 0.875 percent
fixed-rate notes and $750 million of floating-rate notes.   
         14   

Table of Contents  

   Certain of our long-term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. As of November 27, 2016, we
were in compliance with all of these covenants.       (8) Redeemable and Noncontrolling Interests    
  We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert  Marques
S rl. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal s 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as
a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable
interest through additional  paid-in  capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends
annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders  agreement. As of November 27, 2016, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $801.7 million.   
  A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal through July 1, 2021. Net purchases
totaled $123.5 million for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 and $107.6 million for the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015.
     On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in
Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Libert  Marques S rl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing
agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to  Yoplait  and related trademarks. Libert  Marques S rl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to  Libert 
 and related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of their fiscal year end.      The third-party
holder of the Class A Interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) consolidated subsidiary receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the
holder s capital account balance established in the most recent   mark-to-market   valuation (currently $251.5 million). The preferred return rate is adjusted every
three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. On June 1, 2015, the floating preferred return rate on GMC s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month
LIBOR plus 125 basis points.      Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of November 27, 2016, we were in compliance
with all of these covenants.

    (10) Stock Plans       We have various stock-based compensation programs under which awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards, may be granted to employees and  non-employee  directors. These programs and related accounting are described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for
the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.      Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings was as follows:       
    Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes
amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs in fiscal 2016.      As of November 27, 2016, unrecognized compensation
expense related to  non-vested  stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units was $136.7 million. This expense will be recognized over 23 months, on average.   
  Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options less shares used for withholding taxes and the intrinsic value of options exercised were as follows:
      
    We estimate the fair value of each stock option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Black-Scholes option-pricing models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and dividend yield. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over
the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because
trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. Our method of selecting the other valuation assumptions is explained in Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.

     (12) Share Repurchases       Share repurchases were as follows:       
    During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with an
unrelated third party financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $225.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we paid $225.0 million to the financial institution and received 3.7 million shares of
common stock with a fair value of $213.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We recorded an additional 0.2 million shares of common stock upon the completion of the ASR agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We
recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of $213.3 million, and recorded the remaining $11.7 million as a decrease to additional  paid-in  capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of November 29, 2015. Upon completion of the ASR agreement, we reclassified the $11.7 million to treasury stock from additional  paid-in  capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    (13) Statements of Cash Flows       Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the following:       
     (14) Retirement and Postemployment Benefits       Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our U.S. and most of our international defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit
obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans  liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve.
Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of
our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The change in methodology resulted in a decrease in service and
interest cost of approximately $17 million in the three months ended November 27, 2016 and approximately $34 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 compared to what our
costs would have been under the previous method. We expect this change to result in a reduction in our service and interest cost of approximately $68 million for fiscal 2017 compared to our previous methodology. The fiscal 2017 reduction in our
net periodic benefit expense as a result of this change in methodology is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the
United States to 8.25 percent as a result of asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio.

     (15) Business Segment Information       We operate in the consumer foods industry. We have three operating segments by type of customer and geographic region as follows: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice.
     Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains,
drug, dollar and discount chains, and  e-commerce  grocery providers operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are   ready-to-eat   cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety
of organic products including meal kits, granola bars, and cereal.      Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses
outside of the United States. Our product categories include   ready-to-eat   cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products,
dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops.
Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to   
         22   

Table of Contents  

our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.   
  In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, our major product categories are
  ready-to-eat   cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking mixes. Many products we sell are branded to
the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries in the United States.   
  Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit
costs. Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary
economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and
losses from   mark-to-market   valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally
managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated
across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.   
  Our operating segment results were as follows:       
     (16) New Accounting Pronouncements       In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such
investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.      In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal  year-end  that does not coincide with a  month-end  to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the  month-end  that is closest to the
entity s fiscal  year-end    
         23   

Table of Contents  

and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
      (17) Subsequent Events    
  Subsequent to the end of our second quarter, we approved restructuring actions designed to better align our organizational structure with our strategic
initiatives. In connection with these actions, we expect to eliminate approximately 400 to 600 positions globally, subject to consultation with employees and employee representatives in locations as required. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we
expect to record total  pre-tax  restructuring charges of approximately $60 to $90 million, reflecting primarily  one-time,  cash employee severance expenses. These
restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2018. We expect to generate $70 to $90 million in savings in connection with these actions by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition, we are currently assessing the impact of
these organizational structure changes on our reporting segments and expect to begin reporting in modified segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         INTRODUCTION       This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the MD A included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 for important background regarding, among
other things, our key business drivers. Significant trademarks and service marks used in our business are set forth in  italics  herein. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in the  Glossary  section below.
      CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Second Quarter Results       In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, operating results reflected
challenging net sales performance. However, we continued progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives. The net sales decline of 7 percent was driven by volume reductions in the U.S. Retail and International segments,
including the impact of the divestiture of our North American Green Giant product lines (Green Giant), which were partially offset by positive net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 18.7 percent was down 180 basis points
from  year-ago  levels primarily driven by a gain from the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 19.6 percent, driven by the impact of
cost savings and spending optimization initiatives. Diluted earnings per share of $0.80 declined 8 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 which included the gain from the Green Giant divestiture. Adjusted diluted
earnings per share, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, increased 4 percent to $0.85 compared to the second quarter last year (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a
description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).      A summary of our consolidated financial results for the second quarter of fiscal
2017 follows:

   Consolidated  net sales  were as follows:   

(a)  
  Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.        The 7 percent decline in net sales primarily reflected lower organic net sales and the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016.   
  Organic net sales declined 4 percent driven by volume declines in the U.S. Retail and International segments, which were
partially offset by positive net price realization and mix. To improve comparability of results from period to period, organic net sales exclude the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a
53   rd    week of results, when applicable.   
  Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table:

  Primarily the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016.         Cost of sales  decreased $292 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to $2,593 million. The decrease included a $269 million decrease attributable to lower volume and a
$12 million increase attributable to product rate and mix. The impact from both volume and product rate and mix included the effects of the divestiture of Green Giant. We recorded a $29 million net decrease in cost of sales related to the   mark-to-market   valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to a net decrease of $8 million in the second
quarter of fiscal 2016. We recorded $13 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $22 million in the same period last year. We also recorded $11 million of restructuring
initiative project-related costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $16 million in the same period last year (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).   
   Selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses  decreased $65 million to $708 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017
compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. The decrease in SG A expenses primarily reflects a 20 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense and savings from Project Compass and our other cost management initiatives. SG A
expenses as a percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 24 basis points compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

    Divestiture loss  totaled $14 million from the sale of our Martel, Ohio manufacturing facility
during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Divestiture gain totaled $199 million from the sale of our Green Giant product lines during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.       Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs  totaled $29 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $61 million in the same period last year.   
  Total charges associated with our current restructuring initiatives were as follows:   

For further information on these restructuring initiatives, please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this
report.      Interest, net  for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $76 million, up $2 million from fiscal 2016, driven
primarily by higher rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances and changes in the mix of debt.      The  effective tax rate  for
the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was 32.8 percent compared to 37.4 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The 4.6 percentage point decrease was primarily related to significant
 non-deductible  expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 32.4 percent in the second
quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 32.3 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

     After-tax  earnings from joint ventures  for the second quarter
of fiscal 2017 increased to $30 million compared to $23 million in the same quarter last fiscal year, primarily driven by volume growth and lower SG A expenses for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) and volume growth and lower input costs
for  H agen-Dazs  Japan, Inc. (HDJ). On a constant-currency basis,  after-tax  earnings from joint ventures increased 27 percent (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

     Six-Month  Results    
  In the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, operating results reflected challenging net sales
performance. However, we continued progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives. The 7 percent decline in net sales was driven by volume reductions in the U.S. Retail and International segments, including the impact
of the divestiture of Green Giant, which were partially offset by positive net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 17.6 percent was down 80 basis points from  year-ago  levels
primarily driven by a gain from the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. In the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, we made good progress toward our fiscal 2017 adjusted operating profit
margin goal of 18.3 percent with an increase of 120 basis points over the same period in the prior year to 19.4 percent, driven by the impact of cost savings and spending optimization initiatives. For the
 six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, diluted earnings per share of $1.47 declined 6 percent compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 which included the gain from the Green Giant
divestiture. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, on a constant-currency basis for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, increased
2 percent compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

  Primarily the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016.         Cost of sales  decreased $454 million from the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015, to $5,084 million. The decrease included a
$482 million decrease attributable to lower volume and a $52 million increase attributable to product rate and mix. The impact from both volume and product rate and mix included the effects of the divestiture of Green Giant. We recorded
$26 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, compared to $44 million in the same period last year. We also recorded $25 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 compared to $29 million in the same period last year (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). We recorded a $12 million net decrease in cost of sales related to the   mark-to-market   valuation of certain
commodity positions and grain inventories in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, compared to a net decrease of $10 million in the  six-month  period
ended November 29, 2015.       SG A expenses  decreased $164 million to $1,420 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. The decrease in SG A expenses primarily reflects a 22 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense and
cost management initiatives. SG A expenses as a percent of net sales in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 decreased 64 basis points compared with the same period of fiscal 2016.   
   Divestiture loss  totaled $14 million from the sale of our Martel, Ohio manufacturing facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Divestiture gain totaled $199 million from the sale of our Green Giant product lines during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.   
   Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs  totaled $88 million in the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016 compared to $121 million in the same period last year.

  For further information on these restructuring initiatives, please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this
report.      Interest, net  for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, totaled
$149 million, flat to the same period of fiscal 2016.      The  effective tax rate  for the
 six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, was 31.9 percent compared to 35.4 percent for the  six-month  period ended November 29, 2015. The 3.5
percentage point decrease was primarily due to significant  non-deductible  expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items
affecting comparability was 31.9 percent for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 compared to 32.3 percent in the  six-month  period ended
November 29, 2015 (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).        After-tax  earnings from joint ventures  for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, increased to
$54 million compared to $49 million in the same period year in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by lower input costs and favorable foreign currency exchange for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis,
 after-tax  earnings from joint ventures increased 8 percent (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for a description of our use of measures not defined
by GAAP). The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table:

   U.S. Retail Segment Results       U.S.
Retail net sales were as follows:       

(a)  
  Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.        The decrease in U.S. Retail net sales for the quarter and  six-month  periods ended November 27, 2016 was driven by declines in the Meals, Yogurt, Baking and
Cereal operating units, partially offset by growth in the Snacks operating unit. The decline in net sales also includes the impact of the Green Giant divestiture from the Meals operating unit in fiscal 2016.

  Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.        The 5 percent decline in International net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was driven by declines in the Canada, Europe, and Asia/Pacific regions, partially offset by an increase in the
Latin America region. These results included unfavorable foreign exchange and the divestitures of Green Giant in the Canada region, and our Venezuela subsidiary and Argentina foodservice business in the Latin America region in fiscal 2016.
     The 5 percent decline in International net sales for the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016 was driven by declines across all regions. These results included the impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and fiscal 2016 divestitures.

  Segment operating profit decreased 22 percent to $106 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $136 million in the same
period of fiscal 2016. Segment operating profit decreased 19 percent to $206 million in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, compared to $253 million in the same period of fiscal
2016. These results were primarily driven by currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. International segment operating profit decreased 18 percent on a constant-currency
basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. International segment operating

2016 (see the   Non-GAAP  Measures  section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).       Convenience Stores and Foodservice Segment Results       Convenience Stores and Foodservice net
sales were as follows:       

(a)  
  Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.        The 4 percent decline in Convenience Stores and Foodservice net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was driven by market index pricing on bakery flour, partially offset by an increase in the
Focus 6 platforms.      The 5 percent decline in Convenience Stores and Foodservice net sales in the
 six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 was driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and lower volume, partially offset by an increase in the Focus 6 platforms.

  Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.        Segment operating profit increased 6 percent to $109 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $103 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. These results were primarily
driven by cost savings initiatives, lower input costs, and higher grain merchandising earnings.      Segment operating profit increased by
11 percent to $202 million for the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016 from $183 million in the same period last year. These results were primarily driven by cost savings initiatives,
lower input costs, and higher grain merchandise earnings.       UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS    
  Unallocated corporate expense totaled $19 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $72 million in the same period in fiscal
2016. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded $13 million of restructuring charges and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales compared to $22 million of restructuring charges and
$16 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in the same period last year. In addition, we recorded a $29 million net decrease in expense related to the   mark-to-market

valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to an $8 million net decrease in expense in the same period last year.
     Unallocated corporate expense totaled $101 million in the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016, compared to $155 million in the same period last year. In the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, we recorded $26 million of restructuring charges and
$25 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs compared to $44 million of restructuring charges and $29 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in the same period last year. In addition, we recorded a
$12 million net decrease in expense related to the   mark-to-market   valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, compared to a $10 million net decrease in expense in the same period a year ago.       LIQUIDITY       During the  six-month  period ended
November 27, 2016, cash provided by operations was $988 million compared to $1,156 million in the same period last year. The $168 million decrease is primarily driven by a $429 million change in current assets and
liabilities. The $429 million change in current assets and liabilities is primarily due to changes in other current liabilities, which was largely driven by changes in trade and advertising accruals and income taxes payable. Additionally,
we recorded a $14 million loss on a divestiture in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to a $199 million gain on divestiture in the same period last year.       
  Cash used by investing activities during the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, was
$280 million, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $523 million in the same period in fiscal 2016. Investments of $318 million in land, buildings and equipment in the  six-month 
period ended November 27, 2016 increased $25 million compared to the same period a year ago. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our Green Giant product lines for proceeds of $823 million.   
  Cash used by financing activities during the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, was $629 million
compared to $1,342 million in the same period last year. We had $1,165 million of net debt issuances in the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to $294 million of net debt payments in the same period a year ago. We paid
$1,350 million in cash to repurchase common stock and paid $576 million of dividends in the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to $537 million and $531 million, respectively, in the same period last year.   
  As of November 27, 2016, we had $746 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign
operations and potential acquisitions. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate historical earnings from foreign jurisdictions, we
intend to do so only in a  tax-neutral  manner.       CAPITAL RESOURCES    
  Our capital structure was as follows:       
 
         36   

Table of Contents  

   To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes
payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have committed, uncommitted, and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign
operations.      The following table details the  fee-paid  committed and uncommitted credit lines we had
available as of November 27, 2016:       
    The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred
distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder s capital account balance established in the most recent
  mark-to-market   valuation (currently $252 million). On June 1, 2015, the floating preferred return rate on GMC s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of
three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.   
  We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred
return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net
earnings used to calculate EPS in that period.      We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest
in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert  Marques S rl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. As of November 27, 2016, we recorded
Sodiaal s 50 percent interests in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert  Marques S rl as noncontrolling interests, and the redemption value of its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up
to three times before December 2024. As of November 27, 2016, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $802 million, which approximates its fair value.      Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of November 27, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these
covenants.      We have $1,508 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including
$1,000 million of 5.7 percent fixed rate notes due February 2017. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at
least the next 12 months.        OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
      There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in our contractual obligations or  off-balance  sheet arrangements during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES       Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year
ended May 29, 2016. The accounting policies used in preparing our interim fiscal 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those described in our Form  10-K.    
  Our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These
estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
postemployment benefit plans. The assumptions and methodologies used in the determination of those estimates as of November 27, 2016, are the same as those described in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for
the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, except as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.      We tested our goodwill and brand intangible assets for impairment on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2017. As of our annual impairment assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our
intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the  Immaculate Baking  brand and the Latin America reporting unit. The excess fair value above the carrying value of this brand
asset and reporting unit is as follows:       
    In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2017 assessment date, the  Progresso ,  Green
Giant  and  Food Should Taste Good  brand assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In October 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements related to the recognition of income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This will result in the recognition of the income tax consequences resulting
from the intra-entity transfer of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of the transfer. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. This will result in realized
windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in addition to other presentation changes. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of
operations and financial position.      In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and
classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position.   
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The requirements of the new
standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting

periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We do not expect this guidance to have a
material impact on our results of operations or financial position.        NON-GAAP  MEASURES
      We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide
useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.      For each of these  non-GAAP  financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the  non-GAAP  measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an
explanation of why we believe the  non-GAAP  measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which we use the  non-GAAP  measure. These  non-GAAP  measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.      Our
fiscal 2017 outlook for adjusted operating profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes, or has otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of restructuring charges, project-related costs,
mark-to-market effects, and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to
predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in commodity prices or the timing of divestitures, and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2017. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal
2017 GAAP financial results.        Organic Net Sales Growth Rates     
  This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors  measurement of our
performance for incentive compensation purposes. We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they
provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53   rd    week, when applicable, have on
  year-to-year   comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results
of Operations and Segment Operating Results discussions in the MD A above.        Total Segment Operating Profit and Related
Constant-Currency Growth Rate        This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of
Directors  measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A
reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.      Constant-currency total segment operating profit growth is calculated as follows:

     Adjusted Operating Profit as a Percent of Net Sales (Adjusted Operating Profit Margin) Excluding
Certain Items Affecting Comparability        We believe this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for

operating results.

We believe that this
measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or

increase in depreciation expense caused by updating the salvage value and shortening the useful life of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan, but only if impairment is not present.
      Adjusted operating profit margin.  Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-over-year comparability, divided by net
sales.       AOCI . Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).       Constant currency.  Financial results translated to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. To present this
information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year,
rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange
rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.       Derivatives.  Financial instruments such
as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and stock prices.

Level 1:    
     
  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2:    
     
  Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in inactive markets.

  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        The estimated maximum potential   value-at-risk   arising from a  one-day  loss in fair
value for our interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of November 27, 2016 was $25 million, $21 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively. During the  six-month  period ended November 27, 2016, the interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity   value-at-risk   decreased by
$8 million, $7 million, and $1 million, respectively, while the equity   value-at-risk   was flat compared to this measure as of May 29, 2016. The   value-at-risk   for interest rate and foreign exchange decreased due to lower volatility, while
  value-at-risk   for commodity positions was up due to higher market volatility. For additional information, see Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.       

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures.        We, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule  13a-15(e)  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of November 27, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f)  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended November 27, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial

5.   
   COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN         (a)  General . The Common Stock to be issued under this Plan is to be made available from the authorized but unissued Common Stock, shares of Common Stock held in the treasury or Common Stock
purchased on the open market or otherwise. The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized to be issued under the Plan shall be 500,000. Upon forfeiture, expiration or termination of Options or Stock Units, the shares of Common Stock subject
thereto shall again be available for awards under the Plan.      (b)  Adjustments for Corporate Transactions . If a corporate
transaction has occurred affecting the Common Stock such that an adjustment to outstanding awards is required to preserve (or prevent enlargement of) the benefits or potential benefits intended at the time of grant, then in such manner as the
Committee deems equitable, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to: (i) the number and kind of shares which may be awarded under the Plan; (ii) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards, provided that the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to any Option shall always be a whole number; (iii) the number of shares credited to a Stock Unit Account; and (iv) the exercise price of outstanding Options. For this purpose a corporate transaction
includes, but is not limited to, any dividend (other than a cash dividend that is not an extraordinary cash dividend) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, securities of a subsidiary of the Company, other securities or
other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation,  split-up,   spin-off,  combination, repurchase or exchange of
Common Stock or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary,
an adjustment to an Option under this Section 5(b) shall be made in a manner that will not result in the grant of a new Option under Code Section 409A.       
    (a)
 General . Each Participant shall be entitled to receive a retainer with respect to each Board term, beginning the day of each annual stockholders  meeting and ending the day before the succeeding annual stockholders  meeting (the
 Plan Year ) in an amount determined from time to time by the Board or its delegate. Retainers shall be earned and paid at the end of each of the Company s fiscal quarters. A Participant elected to the Board at any time other than the
commencement of a Plan Year shall be entitled to receive a full quarter retainer payment beginning in the fiscal quarter the Participant s election to the Board is effective.   
  (b)  Normal Payment Terms . The normal payment terms for retainers are cash in a lump sum. In the absence of an affirmative election
to the contrary, the retainer (or the portion not subject to such elections) shall be paid within 10 Business Days following the last day of each quarterly period described above in (a).   
  (c)  Deferral Elections . Each Participant may elect an alternative form (lump sum vs. installments) in which a retainer may be
delivered and the timing for such delivery, pursuant to the terms of Section 9. Participants shall make such election by filing an irrevocable Election Form with the Company before the calendar year in which a Plan Year begins. The election
shall apply to amounts earned in each quarterly period described in (a) above that begins during the Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the first Plan Year in which an individual becomes a Participant, an election may be made with
respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election, to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A. Such an election must be made on an Election Form within 30 days after the date the  non-employee 
director becomes eligible to participate in the Plan.      (d)  Deferred Cash Alternative . For each Participant who
affirmatively elects to defer receipt of his or her retainers in the form of deferred cash, the Company shall establish a separate account (a  Deferred Compensation Account ) and credit such deferred cash compensation into that account as
of the date the amounts would otherwise be paid. A separate Deferred Compensation Account shall be established for each Plan Year a Participant makes such a deferral election. Earnings, gains and losses shall be credited to each such Deferred
Compensation Account based on the rate earned by the fund or funds selected by the Participant from among funds or portfolios established by the Company, in its discretion. Distributions from a Deferred Compensation Account shall be made in
accordance with Section 9.   

The Company has established a Supplemental Benefits Trust with Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
N.A. as trustee to hold assets of the Company under certain circumstances as a reserve for the discharge of the Company s obligations as to Deferred Compensation Accounts under the Plan and certain other deferred compensation plans of the
Company. In the event of a Change of Control, the Company shall be obligated to immediately contribute such amounts to the trust as may be necessary to fully fund all Deferred Compensation Accounts payable under the Plan. Any Participant in the Plan
shall have the right to demand and secure specific performance of this provision. All assets held in the trust remain subject only to the claims of the Company s general creditors whose claims against the Company are not satisfied because of
the Company s bankruptcy or insolvency (as those terms are defined in the trust agreement). No Participant has any preferred claim on, or beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the trust before the assets are paid to the Participant
and all rights created under the trust, as under the Plan, are unsecured contractual claims of the Participant against the Company.      (e)  Common Stock Alternative . Each Participant may affirmatively elect to receive all or a specified percentage of his or her retainer for a Plan Year in shares of Common Stock, which, if elected,
will be issued within 10 Business Days following the last day of each quarterly period during the Plan Year described above in (a). Only whole numbers of shares will be issued, with any fractional share amounts paid in cash. For purposes of
computing the number of shares earned each quarter during the Plan Year, the value of each share shall be equal to the Fair Market Value on the third Business Day preceding the last day of each quarter described above in (a).   
  (f)  Death . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if a Participant dies during a Plan Year, the balance of the amount
due for the quarter in which death occurs shall be payable in full under the terms of Section 11(b) of this Plan in cash within 60 days following the date of death.      (g)  Compensation Cap . The aggregate fair market value of all compensation granted to any Participant under this Plan and any other compensatory plan or arrangement of the Company shall not exceed
$800,000 during any Plan Year; provided, however, that compensation paid to any Participant designated as chair of the Board shall not be subject to the foregoing limitation. For purposes of calculating the value of
 non-cash  compensation paid to a Participant, all stock-based awards shall be valued at the grant date fair value as determined by the Company for financial statement purposes and all other  non-cash  compensation shall be valued at fair market value as reasonably determined by the Committee.       

7.   
    NON-QUALIFIED  STOCK OPTIONS         (a)  Grant of Options . A Participant may be awarded an option (an  Option ) to purchase shares of Common Stock in an amount determined from time to time by the Board or its delegate. All
Options granted under the Plan shall be  non-statutory  options not entitled to special tax treatment under Code Section 422.      (b)  Option Exercise Price . The per share price to be paid by the Participant at the time an Option is exercised shall be greater than or equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.
     (c)  Term of Option . Each Option shall expire no later than ten (10) years after the date of grant, as determined
by the Board or its delegate.      (d)  Exercise and Vesting of Option . Each Option will vest on the date specified by the
Board or its delegate. Upon vesting, a Participant shall be given the full term to exercise the Option without regard to whether he or she continues to serve on the Board. If a Participant ceases to serve on the Board prior to the date an Option
vests, such Option shall be forfeited and all further rights of the Participant with respect to such Option shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a participant should die during his or her term of service on the Board, any vested Option
may be exercised by the person(s) designated under the terms of Section 11(b) of this Plan, and any unvested Options shall fully vest and become exercisable upon death for the remainder of the Option s full term.   
  (e)  Method of Exercise . A Participant exercising an Option shall give notice to the Company of such exercise and of the number of
shares elected to be purchased prior to 4:30 P.M. CST/CDT on the day of exercise. The exercise price shall be paid to the Company at the time of such exercise, subject to any applicable rule adopted by the Committee:   

(i)  
  in cash (including check, draft, money order or wire transfer made payable to the order of the Company);     

(ii)  
  through the tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant (by either actual delivery or attestation); or     

(iii)  
  by a combination of (i) and (ii) above; or        (iv) by authorizing a third party broker to sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option and remitting to the Company such sales proceeds to pay the entire
exercise price.   

To determine the amount of the payment, Common Stock delivered pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above shall
have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of exercise.      (f)   Non-transferability  . Except as provided by rule adopted by the Committee, an Option shall be  non-assignable  and  non-transferable  by
a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. A Participant shall forfeit any Option assigned or transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than as permitted under this subsection.   
  (g)  No Reload Rights . No Option granted under this Plan shall contain any provision entitling the Participant to the automatic
grant of additional Options in connection with any exercise of the original Option.      (h)  No Repricing . Subject to
Section 5(b) and absent stockholder approval, the exercise price of an outstanding Option may not be decreased after the grant date; no outstanding Options may be surrendered to the Company as consideration or otherwise for the grant of a new Option
with a lower exercise price, any other award or cash; and no other modifications to any outstanding Options may be made that would be treated as a  repricing  under the then applicable rules or listing requirements adopted by the New York
Stock Exchange.

 Awards . On the effective date of the Plan (or, if a Participant is first elected after the effective date of the Plan, then on the date the Participant first attends a Board meeting) and at the close of business on each successive annual
stockholders  meeting, each Participant who is  re-elected  to the Board shall be awarded the right to receive shares of Common Stock ( Stock Units ) in an amount determined from time to time by
the Board or its delegate, subject to vesting as provided in Section 8(b). Only a Participant who is  re-elected  to the Board shall be entitled to a grant under this Section 8(a) of Stock Units awarded at the
close of business on an annual meeting date after the date of the original grant to Participants. A separate  Stock Unit Account  will be established for the Participant each time an award of Stock Units is made.   
  Participants receiving Stock Units will have no rights as stockholders of the Company with respect to allocations made to their Stock
Unit Account(s), except the right to receive dividend equivalent allocations under Section 8(d).      Stock Units may not be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of until such time as share certificates for Common Stock are issued to the Participants.      (b)  Vesting of Stock Units . Except as otherwise specified by the Board or its delegate at the time of grant, a Participant s interest in the Stock Units shall vest on the earlier of
(i) date of the annual stockholders  meeting next following the grant date of the Stock Units and (ii) the date 13 months after the grant date of the Stock Units. If a Participant ceases to serve on the Board prior to the date the
Participant s interest in a grant of Stock Units vests, such Stock Units shall be forfeited and all further rights of the Participant to or with respect to such Stock Units shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who dies
while serving on the Board prior to the vesting of Stock Units shall fully vest in such Stock Units, effective as of the date of death, and the Stock Units shall be paid pursuant to Section 11(b) of this Plan.   
  (c)  Election Concerning Receipt of Common Stock . Each Participant receiving an award of Stock Units under Section 8(a) may elect
the time and form (lump sum vs. installments) of distribution of Common Stock and dividend equivalents attributable to such Stock Units, pursuant to the terms of Section 9. If no affirmative election is made, all Stock Units shall be paid in
shares of Common Stock, and dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash, within 10 days following vesting.      (d)  Dividend
Equivalents . As of the first day of each quarter, during the applicable restricted period for all Stock Units awarded hereunder, the Company shall credit to each Participant an amount equal to the value of all dividends and other distributions
(whether in cash or other property) paid by the Company during the prior quarter on the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. Any dividend equivalents or other distributions credited with respect to Stock Units shall be distributed in cash
(with or without interest or other earnings, as provided at the discretion of the Committee) to the Participant only if, when and to the extent such Stock Units vest. The value of dividends and other distributions payable with respect to Stock Units
that do not vest shall be forfeited.      (e)  Timing of Elections . In order to make an election under Section 8(c) with
respect to Stock Units awarded for a Plan Year, a Participant shall file an irrevocable Election Form with the Committee before the calendar year in which the Plan Year begins. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the first year Plan Year in which an
individual becomes a Participant, an election may be made with respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election, to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A. Such an election must be made on an Election Form within 30 days after
the date the  non-employee  director becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. The Election Form shall indicate whether the Participant directs the value of any dividend equivalents accrued on Stock Units to
be paid in cash or reinvested in additional Stock Units.       

9.   
   DISTRIBUTION PROVISIONS FOR DEFERRED CASH AND STOCK UNITS      

The following distribution provisions shall apply to Deferred Compensation Accounts and
Stock Unit Accounts:      (a)  Timing . Distributions from Deferred Compensation Accounts shall normally commence at
Separation from Service, however, a Participant may affirmatively elect a specified date for commencement, provided said date is not later than age 75. The same rule applies to Stock Units which have been deferred beyond the vesting period described
in Section 8(b). Elections as to the timing of benefit commencement shall be made in accordance with Sections 6 and 8, as appropriate.      Notwithstanding the above or any other provision of this Plan, distributions may not be made to a Key Employee upon a Separation from Service before the date which is six months after the date of the Key
Employee s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Key Employee). Any payments that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the
Participant s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the first day of the month after the Participant s death).   
  (b)  Form of Distribution . Distributions shall normally be made in a lump sum. However, a Participant may affirmatively elect to
receive substantially equal annual installments over a period of up to 10 years. Such elections shall be made in accordance with Sections 6 and 8, as appropriate.      (c)  Manner of Distribution . Amounts credited to Deferred Compensation Accounts shall be paid in cash. Amounts credited to Stock Unit Accounts shall be paid in Common Stock based on the number of
Stock Units credited to the Stock Unit Account and paid in cash equal to any dividend equivalent amounts which had not been elected to purchase additional Stock Units.      (d)  Distribution Upon Death . Notwithstanding any elections by a Participant or provisions of the Plan to the contrary, if a Participant dies before full distribution of a Deferred Compensation
Account or Stock Unit Account, such accounts shall be distributed under the terms of Section 11(b) of this Plan in a lump sum within 60 days following the date of death.      (e)  Permitted Payment Delay To Avoid Violations of Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, any distribution to a Participant under the Plan shall be delayed upon the
Committee s reasonable anticipation that the making of the payment would violate Federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided, that any payment delayed pursuant to this Section 9(e) shall ultimately be paid in accordance with Code
Section 409A.      (f)  Payment Acceleration . If amounts deferred under the Plan must be included in a Participant s
income under Code Section 409A prior to the scheduled distribution of such amounts, distribution of such amount shall be made immediately to the Participant.       
    (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if during the Plan Year in which a Change of Control occurs a Participant, at the request of the Company or its stockholders, resigns or is otherwise replaced, removed or dismissed
from the Board, then all Options and Stock Units held by the Participant shall fully and immediately vest, and for Options, shall be exercisable and, for Stock Units, shall be paid immediately if the Participant experiences a  separation from
service  under Code Section 409A, pursuant to the terms of the Plan that are otherwise applicable. A  Change of Control  means:      (i) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  1934 Act )) (a
 Person ) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule  13d-3  promulgated under the 1934 Act) of voting securities of the Company where such acquisition causes such Person to own 20% or more of
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the  Outstanding Voting Securities  provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (i),
the following acquisitions shall not be deemed to result in a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company; (B) any acquisition by the Company; (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company; or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction that complies with clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subsection (iii) below; and
provided, further, that if any Person s beneficial ownership of the Outstanding Voting Securities reaches or exceeds 20% as a result of a transaction described in clause (A) or (B) above, and such Person subsequently acquires beneficial
ownership of additional voting securities of the Company, such subsequent acquisition shall be treated as an acquisition that causes such Person to own 20% or more of the Outstanding Voting Securities; or   
  (ii) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the  Incumbent Board ) cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or   

(iii) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or
consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, (each, a  Business Combination  excluding, however, such a Business Combination pursuant to which: (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding
Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company
or all or substantially all of the Company s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Voting
Securities; (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation
except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination; and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent
Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or      (iv) Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.      (b) If, in the event of a Change of Control, and to the extent outstanding Options or Stock Units are not assumed by a successor corporation (or its affiliate) or other successor entity or person, or
replaced with an award or grant that solely in the discretionary judgment of the Committee, which shall be reasonable, preserves the existing value of outstanding Options and Stock Units at the time of the Change of Control, then the following shall
occur:      (i) Subject to the other provisions of this subsection (b), all Options shall vest and become exercisable immediately
upon the Change of Control event;      (ii) All Stock Units shall vest immediately;   
  (iii) To the extent Code Section 409A applies, if the Change of Control constitutes a  change in control  event as described
in IRS regulations or other guidance under Code section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Participants  Stock Units shall be settled and paid immediately upon the Change of Control in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A.   
  (iv) If the Change of Control does not constitute a  change in control  event as described in IRS regulations or other
guidance under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Stock Units that are not otherwise subject to Section 409A, and on which a deferral election was not made, shall be settled and paid immediately upon the Change of Control. The Stock Units subject to
Section 409A shall be settled in cash equal to either the Fair Market Value of such Stock Units at the time of the Change of Control, plus interest at the prime rate plus 1% from the Change of Control to the date of payment, which shall be the date
the original restriction period would have closed or the date elected pursuant to the proper deferral election, as applicable.   
  In the discretion of the Committee and notwithstanding subsection (b)(i) above or any other Plan provision, outstanding Options (both
exercisable and unexercisable) may be cancelled at the time of the Change of Control in exchange for cash, property or a combination thereof that is determined by the Committee to be at least equal to the excess (if any) of the value of the
consideration that would be received in such Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock over the exercise price for such Options. For purposes of clarification, by operation of this provision Options that would not yield a gain at the time of
the Change of Control under the aforementioned equation are subject to cancellation without consideration. Furthermore, the Committee is under no obligation to treat Options or Participants uniformly and has the discretionary authority to treat
Options and Participants disparately.      (c) If in the event of a Change of Control and to the extent outstanding Options and
Stock Units are assumed by any successor corporation, affiliate thereof, person or other entity, or are replaced with awards that, solely in the discretionary judgment of the Committee preserve the existing value of outstanding Options and Stock
Units at the time of the Change of Control and provide for vesting payout terms that are at least as favorable to Participants as vesting and payout terms applicable to Options and Stock Units, then all such Options and Stock Units or such
substitutes thereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms, subject to Section 10(a).       
    (a) The
Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have full discretionary power and authority to administer and manage the operations of the Plan, and to interpret the terms of the Plan, formulate additional rules and policies for
carrying out terms and provisions of the Plan, and amend, modify or terminate the Plan as from time to time it deems proper and in the best interests of the Company. No amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall alter or impair the
rights of any Participant pursuant to an   

outstanding award hereunder in any material respect without the consent of the Participant. Any decision or interpretation adopted by the Committee shall be final and conclusive.   
  (b) Each Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Option or to receive any payment which under the terms
of the Plan may become exercisable or payable on or after the Participant s death. At any time, and from time to time, any such designation may be changed or cancelled by the Participant without the consent of any such beneficiary. Any such
designation, change or cancellation must be on a form provided for that purpose by the Committee and shall not be effective until received by the Committee. Such form may establish other rules as the Committee deems appropriate. If no beneficiary
has been properly designated by a deceased Participant, or if all the designated beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, the beneficiary shall be the Participant s estate. If the Participant designates more than one beneficiary, any
Options shall be divided among beneficiaries equally, and any payments under the Plan to such beneficiaries shall be made in equal shares, unless the Participant has expressly designated otherwise, in which case such Options shall be divided, and
the payments shall be made, in the portions designated by the Participant.       
    The
validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any such actions taken under or relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law.   
   
    Unless
otherwise notified, all notices under this Plan shall be sent in writing to the Company, attention Corporate Compensation, P.O. Box 1113, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55440. All correspondence to a Participant shall be sent to the address recorded on
an Election Form or as otherwise provided by the Participant in writing.       
    Upon
termination of the Plan, distribution of Deferred Compensation Accounts and Stock Unit Accounts shall be made as described in Section 9, unless the Committee determines in its sole discretion that all such amounts shall be distributed upon
termination in accordance with the requirements under Code Section 409A. Upon termination of the Plan, no further deferrals of retainers or Stock Units, or additional accruals of Stock Units through dividend reinvestment on deferred Stock Units,
shall be permitted; however, earnings, gains and losses shall continue to be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account balances in accordance with Section 6 until the Deferred Compensation Account balances are fully distributed.   
   
    It is intended that this Plan shall comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A and the Treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject the Participants to the payment of additional taxes
and interest under Code Section 409A. In furtherance of this intent, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions.
