1.       Business
and Significant Accounting Policies  

Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC  

 On August 25, 2015 Solitario Exploration
  Royalty Corp. ( Solitario  or the  Company ), along with DHI Minerals (U.S.) Ltd. ( DHI ),
sold their combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton gold project ( Mt. Hamilton ) to Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC ( Waterton ),
for total cash proceeds of US$30 million (the  Transaction ) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on June
10, 2015. Solitario sold its 80% interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC ( MH-LLC ), a limited liability company which held 100%
of the Mt. Hamilton project assets, and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC. DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely Gold and Minerals,
Inc. ( Ely ). Solitario received gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely received gross cash proceeds of US$6
million. Solitario s costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional service fees, were
$439,000. The Transaction was structured as the sale of Solitario s and DHI s combined membership interests in MH-LLC. 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 virtually all of the costs associated with MH-LLC and the assets sold were directly related to the development
of Mt. Hamilton, which were capitalized to mineral property. Accordingly, separate presentation of discontinued operations would
not have resulted in any material change to the results presented in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

See Note 1,  Business and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies, to the annual financial statements included in Solitario s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for
a more complete discussion of the sale of Solitario s interest in MH-LLC. 

Business and company formation  

Solitario is an exploration
stage company at September 30, 2016 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by the SEC. Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado
on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ( Crown ). In July 1994, Solitario became
a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange through its initial public offering. Solitario has been actively involved
in mineral exploration since 1993. Solitario s primary business is to acquire and hold a portfolio of exploration properties
and other related assets for future sale or joint venture or to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable
reserves. Solitario s primary focus is for the furtherance of its exploration assets and to the acquisition of additional
precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests. 

Solitario has recorded revenue in
the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on its Mt. Hamilton property.
Revenues from the sale or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent
source of revenue and would only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. 

The accompanying interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of Solitario for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are unaudited and are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They do not include all disclosures
required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements, but in the opinion of management, include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results, which may be achieved in the future or for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto which are included in Solitario s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accounting policies set forth in those annual financial statements are the
same as the accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements, except as modified for appropriate interim
financial statement presentation. 

Table of Contents     7       

Financial reporting  

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Solitario and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles ), and are expressed in US dollars. 

Revenue recognition  

Solitario records delay rental payments
as revenue in the period received. Any payments received for the sale of property interests are recorded as a reduction of the
related property's capitalized cost. Proceeds which exceed the capitalized cost of the property without reserves are recognized
as revenue. Payments received on the sale of properties with reserves are recognized as revenue to the extent the proceeds exceed
the proportionate basis in the assets sold. 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Some of the more significant estimates included in the preparation of Solitario's financial statements pertain to: (i) the fair
value of Solitario s short-term investments; (ii) the fair value of Solitario's stock option grants to employees; (iii) the
fair value of Solitario's marketable equity securities; and (iv) the fair value of the Vendetta Mining Corp ( Vendetta )
warrants Solitario owns. 

Cash equivalents   

Cash equivalents include investments
in highly liquid money-market securities with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Solitario has concentrations
of cash at September 30, 2016 deposited in banks and brokerage accounts of $192,000 which are not covered under the federal deposit
insurance rules for the United States. At September 30, 2016 Solitario holds short-term investments in United States Treasury securities
of $7,006,000. 

Mineral properties   

Solitario expenses all exploration
costs incurred on its mineral properties prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves through the completion of a
feasibility study. Initial acquisition costs of Solitario s mineral properties are capitalized. Solitario began capitalizing
all of its development expenditures on Mt. Hamilton, subsequent to the completion of a feasibility study in 2012 through the date
of the Transaction. Solitario regularly performs evaluations of its investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability
and/or the residual value of its investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, utilizing established guidelines
based upon undiscounted future net cash flows from the asset or upon the determination that certain exploration properties do not
have sufficient potential for economic mineralization. 

Derivative instruments  

Solitario accounts
for its derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
Solitario has not designated its covered calls as hedging instruments and any changes in the fair value of covered calls and the
Vendetta Warrants (defined below) are recognized in the statement of operations in the period of the change. 

Table of Contents     8       

Fair value  

FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ) establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced
disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. For certain
of Solitario's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate
fair value due to their short-term maturities. Solitario's short-term investments and marketable equity securities are carried
at their estimated fair value based on quoted market prices. See Note 7,  Fair Value  below. 

Marketable equity securities  

Solitario's investments in marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the
securities owned. Solitario records investments in marketable equity securities as available-for-sale for investments in publicly
traded marketable equity securities for which it does not exercise significant control and where Solitario has no representation
on the Board of Directors of those companies and exercises no control over the management of those companies. The cost of marketable
equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Changes in fair values are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity, unless a decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, in which
case the decline is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations.   

Foreign exchange  

The United States dollar is the functional
currency for all of Solitario's foreign subsidiaries. Although Solitario's exploration activities outside of the United States
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been conducted primarily in Peru and Mexico, a portion of the payments
under the land, leasehold and exploration agreements of Solitario are denominated in United States dollars. Foreign currency gains
and losses are included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. 

Income taxes  

Solitario accounts for income taxes
in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). Under ASC 740, income taxes are
provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred
taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible
when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits
that are available to offset future taxable income and income taxes, respectively. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  

ASC 740 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. ASC 740 provides that a company's tax position will be considered settled if the taxing authority has
completed its examination, the company does not plan to appeal, and it is remote that the taxing authority would reexamine the
tax position in the future. These provisions of ASC 740 had no effect on Solitario's financial position or results of operations.
See Note 8,  Income Taxes  below. 

Earnings per share  

The calculation of basic and diluted
income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 as the
RMB Warrants (defined below) expired in August 2016 and all previously outstanding stock options had either expired or were cancelled
as of September 30, 2016. Potentially dilutive shares related to outstanding common stock options of 3,748,000 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the warrants issued to RMB Australia Holdings in connection with a 2012 financing (the
 RMB Warrants,  which were exercisable to acquire 1,624,748 shares of common stock) for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share because the effects were anti-dilutive. 

Table of Contents     9       

Employee stock compensation and incentive plans  

Solitario classifies all of its stock
options as equity options in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Solitario cancelled all of its remaining outstanding options and had no outstanding
stock options as of September 30, 2016. 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-19, Compensation-Stock
Compensation (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-19 ), as part of its simplification initiative, which affects all entities that
issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess
tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy
election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold for income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and
the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-19 is effective for fiscal year ending March 2018
using either the prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered by ASU 2016-19. 

In December 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within the year, beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard may be applied either retrospectively
or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 did not have a material
impact on the financial statements of Solitario as of September 30, 2016 or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

2.        Mineral
Property  

The following table details Solitario s investment in Mineral
Property: 

All exploration costs on our other
exploration properties, none of which have proven and probable reserves, including any additional costs incurred for subsequent
lease payments or exploration activities related to our projects are expensed as incurred. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Solitario acquired certain net smelter royalties on non-producing exploration leases in Montana previously owned by Atna
Resources, Ltd. for $40,000. 

Discontinued projects   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Solitario closed its exploration office in Mexico. Solitario sold its Norcan and Aconchi exploration projects in Mexico
for a retained a 1% royalty on both the Norcan and Aconchi properties. Solitario recorded a mineral property write-down of $10,000
related to the Norcan and Aconchi properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, Solitario recorded
a loss on other assets in Mexico of $14,000 related to the exit from its exploration activities in Mexico during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Solitario did not record any mineral
property write-downs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Capitalization of Mt. Hamilton cost during 2015  

On February 22, 2012, Solitario earned
an 80% interest in MH-LLC as a result of the completion of a feasibility study on Mt. Hamilton prepared by SRK Consulting (US),
Inc. of Lakewood, Colorado ( SRK ). In October 2014, SRK, on behalf of Solitario completed an updated feasibility study
on Mt. Hamilton. Solitario sold its interest in Mt. Hamilton on August 25, 2015 through the Transaction. Capitalization of costs
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, prior to the Transaction, is detailed in the following table 

Exploration expense  

The following items comprised exploration expense: 

3.        Marketable
Equity Securities  

Solitario's investments in marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the
securities owned. The cost of marketable equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Changes in
market value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within shareholders' equity, unless a decline in market
value is considered other than temporary, in which case the decline is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations. 

The following tables summarize Solitario s
marketable equity securities and accumulated other comprehensive income related to its marketable equity securities: 

The following table represents changes in marketable
equity securities. 

4.        Other
Assets  

The following items comprised other assets: 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 Solitario purchased 7,240,000 units of Vendetta for aggregate consideration of $289,000. Each unit included one common
share of Vendetta and one purchase warrant which allows the holder to purchase one share of Vendetta common stock at a price of
Cdn$0.10 per share for a period of two years (the  Vendetta Warrants ). As of September 30, 2016, the common shares
of Vendetta are carried at their fair value and included in marketable equity securities; see Note 3  Marketable Equity Securities, 
above. The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their fair value, based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model. During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, Solitario recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $91,000 and $306,000, respectively,
related to the Vendetta Warrants, see Note 6,  Derivative Instruments,  below. 

5.       Short-term
Debt  

RMB Facility Agreement  

On August 10, 2012, Solitario entered
into a Facility Agreement and borrowed $5,000,000 from RMB Australia Holdings, Limited (the  RMB Loan ). In connection
with the Facility Agreement, Solitario recorded a warrant discount related to the RMB Warrants issued in connection with the RMB
Loan. Solitario also recorded deferred offering costs related to the RMB Loan. The warrant discount and deferred offering costs
were amortized on a straight-line basis to interest cost over 36 months, the term of the Facility Agreement. The RMB Loan amounts
bore interest at the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 5%, payable in arrears on the last day of each quarterly interest period. The RMB
Loan was repaid on August 25, 2015, in connection with the Transaction. Solitario had no balance due on the RMB Loan as of December
31, 2015 or September 30, 2016. 

Solitario recorded the following interest
cost during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the RMB Loan:

6.        Derivative
Instruments  

RMB Warrants  

The RMB Warrants,
which entitled the holder to purchase a total of 1,624,748 shares of Solitario common stock, expired worthless on August 21, 2016.
Solitario no longer has any liability related to the RMB Warrants as of September 30, 2016. Solitario recorded a $4,000 liability
for the RMB Warrants as of December 31, 2015 for the fair value of the RMB Warrants based upon a Black-Scholes model. Solitario
recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the expiration of the
RMB Warrants. 

Covered Call Options   

From time to time Solitario has sold
covered call options against its holdings of Kinross Gold Corporation ( Kinross ). The business purpose of selling
covered calls is to provide additional liquidity on a limited portion of shares of Kinross that Solitario may sell in the near
term, which is generally defined as less than one year. Solitario has not designated its covered calls as hedging instruments and
records gains or loss on the covered call in the period of the change. As of September 30, 2016, Solitario had written two covered
calls, one covering 50,000 shares, expiring January 20, 2017, with an exercise price of $4.00 per share and another covering 50,000
shares, expiring January 20, 2017 with an exercise price of $4.50 per share. Solitario has recorded a liability of $56,000 for
the fair value of its Kinross covered call as of September 30, 2016, based on quoted market prices. 

Solitario recorded the following gain
(loss) on derivative instruments:

the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. Solitario s marketable equity securities
are carried at their estimated fair value primarily based on quoted market prices. The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their
estimated fair value at September 30, 2016 of $412,000; based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model, see Note 4,  Other Assets, 
above. 

Solitario
accounts for its financial instruments under ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced
disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC 820 also
requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets
and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows: 

Level 1 : quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;    

Level 2 : quoted
prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability; or    

Level 3 : Unobservable
inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.    

The
determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were no reclassifications in financial
assets or liabilities between Level 1, 2 or 3 categories. 

The following is a listing of Solitario s
financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and where they are classified within
the hierarchy as of September 30, 2016:

financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and where they are classified within
the hierarchy as of December 31, 2015: 

8.        Income
Taxes  

Solitario accounts for income taxes
in accordance with ASC 740. Under ASC 740, income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial
statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different
periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences
of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred
taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income and income taxes,
respectively. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. 

At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, Solitario has recorded no net deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance, which fully offsets the net
deferred tax assets, has been recorded because it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize some portion or
all of its deferred tax assets.  Solitario continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Solitario recorded deferred tax benefits of $27,000 and $264,000, respectively, in the statement of operations
and recorded a deferred tax expense of the same amounts to other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains on marketable
equity securities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, income taxes have been allocated between discontinued
operations and continuing operations in accordance with ASC No. 740  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), which resulted
in an income tax expense for continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $997,000. 

9.       Employee
Stock Compensation Plans  

On August 24, 2016, the holders of
options to acquire Solitario common stock voluntarily surrendered for cancellation all options previously granted to such persons
pursuant to the 2013 Solitario Exploration and Royalty Corp Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ) and
the 2006 Stock Option Incentive Plan (the  2006 Plan ). Solitario cancelled the options upon surrender. As a result,
there are no outstanding options under either the 2006 Plan or the 2013 Plan as of September 30, 2016. 

Historically, stock option awards
at the time of grant had a five year term and vested 25% on date of grant and 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates.
Solitario recognizes stock option compensation expense on the date of grant for 25% of the grant date fair value, and subsequently,
based upon a straight line amortization of the unvested grant date fair value of each of its outstanding options. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Solitario recorded $939,000 and $970,000, respectively, of stock option expense for the
amortization, through the date of cancellation of previously outstanding options, of grant date fair value with a credit to additional
paid-in-capital, including $721,000 of unamortized grant date fair value as of the date of cancellation of options during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, discussed below. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Solitario
recorded $157,000 and $470,000, respectively, of stock option expense for the amortization of grant date fair value with a credit
to additional paid-in-capital. 

The 2006 Plan  

 On June 27, 2006 Solitario s
shareholders approved the 2006 Plan. Under the terms of the 2006 Plan an aggregate of 2,800,000 shares were initially reserved
for the award of options. As of June 26, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Plan, no additional awards may be made
pursuant to the 2006 Plan. As of September 30, 2016 there are no outstanding stock options under the 2006 Plan. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Solitario granted options to acquire 350,000 shares of common stock under the 2006 Plan. By their initial terms the options
vested 25% on the date of grant and thereafter were to vest 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates of the date of grant,
and had a grant date fair value based upon a Black-Scholes model with a 63% expected volatility, and 1% risk-free interest rate.
These options were subsequently surrendered by the holders and cancelled on August 24, 2016. As a result of the cancellation Solitario
recognized $84,000 of unamortized grant date fair value as of the date of the cancellation under the 2006 Plan. No options were
granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. No options were exercised during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 or 2015 under the 2006 Plan. 

The 2013 Plan  

 On June 18, 2013, Solitario s
shareholders approved the 2013 Plan. Under the terms of the 2013 Plan, an aggregate of 1,750,000 shares are currently reserved
for awards to directors, officers, employees and consultants. Such awards may take the form of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units.  

On July 28, 2016, the Board of Directors
granted 1,699,000 stock options under the 2013 Plan. These options were subsequently surrendered by the holders and cancelled
on August 24, 2016. As a result of the cancellation, Solitario recognized $637,000 of unamortized grant date fair value as of
the date of the cancellation under the 2013 Plan. As of September 30, 2016 there were no outstanding stock options or other awards
under the 2013 Plan. There were no exercises of options or awards under the 2013 Plan during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no stock awards or option grants under the 2013 Plan during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

10.        Shareholders 
Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  

Share Repurchase Program  

On October 28, 2015, Solitario s
Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes Solitario to purchase up to two million shares of its outstanding
common stock through December 31, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Solitario purchased 18,000 and
424,000 shares of Solitario common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $13,000 and $214,000, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, Solitario has purchased a total of 569,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $281,000 under the
share repurchase program since its inception. 

Item 2.    Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements of Solitario for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in
Solitario s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Solitario's financial condition and results
of operations are not necessarily indicative of what may be expected in future periods. Unless otherwise indicated, all references
to dollars are to U.S. dollars. 

(a) Business Overview and Summary 

We are an exploration stage company
with a focus on the acquisition of precious and base metal properties with exploration potential and the development or purchase
of royalty interests. Prior to the sale of Mt. Hamilton (discussed below), our primary focus was on the development of Mt. Hamilton,
where we had an 80% interest in Mt. Hamilton through MH-LLC. Our current focus is to acquire and hold a portfolio of mineral exploration
properties and assets for future sale, joint venture or to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves.
Although our mineral properties may be developed in the future by us, through a joint venture or by a third party, we have never
developed a mineral property. 

We have recorded revenue in the past
from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on our Mt. Hamilton property. The
revenue from the sale of MH-LLC is included in gain on sale of discontinued operations. Revenues from the sale or joint venture
of our other properties have not historically been a significant annual source of revenue and would occur, if at all, on an infrequent
basis in the future. 

We currently consider our carried
interest in our Bongar  project in Peru to be our core mineral property asset. We expect our joint venture partner will
continue the development and furtherance of the Bongar  asset and will monitor progress at Bongar . 

As
of September 30, 2016 we have significant balances of cash and short-term investments that we anticipate using to, in part, acquire
additional mineral property assets. The  fluctuations in precious metal and other commodity prices has contributed to a challenging
environment for mineral exploration and development, which has created opportunities as well as challenges for the potential acquisition
of advanced mineral exploration projects or other related assets at potentially attractive terms. We  have,
and expect to, focus on evaluating  and potentially  acquiring  one or more  additional
 assets if we believe it will enhance shareholder value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we acquired
certain net smelter royalties on non-producing exploration leases in Montana previously owned by Atna Resources, Ltd. 

(b) Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC  

Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC  

 On August 25, 2015 we, along with
DHI, sold our combined interests in Mt. Hamilton to Waterton, for total cash proceeds of US$30 million. We sold our 80% interest
in MH-LLC and received gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and DHI received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million. Solitario s
costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional service fees, were $439,000. The Transaction
was structured as the sale of Solitario s and DHI s combined membership interests in MH-LLC. 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 virtually all of the costs associated with MH-LLC and the assets sold were directly related to the development
of Mt. Hamilton, which were capitalized to mineral property during all periods. Accordingly, separate presentation of discontinued
operations would not have resulted in any material change to our results presented in the consolidated statements of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

See Note 1,  Business and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies,  to the annual financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC for a more complete discussion of the sale of Solitario s interest in MH-LLC. 

(c) Results of Operations 

Comparison of the quarter ended September 30, 2016
to the quarter ended September 30, 2015  

We had a net loss of $1,119,000 or
approximately $0.03 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $9,950,000
or approximately $0.25 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As explained in more detail below,
the primary reason for the change from net income to a net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net
income in the three months ended September 30, 2015 was (i) the sale of our interest in MH-LLC for gross cash proceeds of $24,000,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2015, without a comparable sale in 2016; an increase in non-cash stock option compensation
expense, included in general and administrative expenses to $939,000 including expenses related to the cancellation of options
of $721,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to non-cash stock option compensation expense of 156,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2015; and (iii) an increase in exploration expense to $132,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to exploration expense of $16,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. These were
partially offset by (i) a gain on sales of marketable equity securities of $10,000 during the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to a loss on sale of marketable equity securities of $1,333,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015;
(ii) a decrease in non-stock option general and administrative costs to $274,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to non-stock option general and administrative costs of $325,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015; (iii)
a gain of $163,000 on derivative instruments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $1,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015; (iv) interest income of $27,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to interest income of $3,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015; and (v) the recording of an income tax benefit of
$27,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of $997,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The significant changes for these items are discussed in more detail below. 

On August 25, 2015 we, along with
DHI, sold our combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton project for total cash proceeds of US$30 million in the Transaction. We sold
our 80% interest in MH-LLC and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC. DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely. We received gross
cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million. Our costs and fees related to the Transaction,
including broker fees and professional service fees, were $439,000. The gain on sale of MH-LLC as of September 30, 2015 is shown
in discontinued operations as follows: 

Income taxes have been allocated
between discontinued operations and continuing operations in accordance with ASC No. 740  Income Taxes  ( ASC
740 ), which resulted in an income tax expense for continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 of $997,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 our net operating loss carry-forwards exceed our unrealized
gains on marketable equity securities and we are in a net tax asset position and we provide a valuation allowance for all deferred
taxes payable. However, we recorded a deferred tax benefit in the statement of operations for the amount of the deferred taxes
recorded in other comprehensive income of $27,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of our exploration
activities and other tax deductible expenses, we anticipate we will not have currently payable income taxes during 2016. In addition
to the valuation allowance discussed above, we provide a valuation allowance for our foreign net operating losses, which are primarily
related to our exploration activities in Peru. We anticipate we will continue to provide a valuation allowance for these net operating
losses until we are in a net tax liability position with regards to those countries where we operate or until it is more likely
than not that we will be able to realize those net operating losses in the future. 

Our
net exploration expense increased to $132,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to exploration expense
of $16,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. We increased our reconnaissance exploration activities during the
2016 period primarily related to the shift in focus from Mt. Hamilton to the evaluation of mineral properties for acquisition as
discussed above. These activities were focused on the evaluation of exploration properties and /or companies for potential acquisitions
or other strategic transactions. In addition we increased our reconnaissance exploration activities in Peru for the same purpose.
During three months ended September 30, 2016 we had one contract geologist in Peru, however, our Denver personnel are spending
the majority of their time on exploration activities described above in this paragraph. We anticipate we will continue with our
current exploration activities, and to the extent we acquire new exploration projects or assets to expand those activities further
and as a result expect our full-year exploration expenditures for 2016 to exceed the expenditures for full-year 2015. 

Exploration expense (in thousands) by project for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following: 

General and administrative costs,
excluding stock option compensation costs discussed below, were $274,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $325,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The major components of these costs were related to (i) salaries
and benefit expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $150,000 compared to salaries and benefits expense of $236,000
in the same period of 2015; (ii) legal and accounting expenditures of $68,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $1,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015, which during the 2015 period the majority of the expenses were related
to the Transaction, resulting in the lower cost for continuing operations; (iii) office rent and expenses of $23,000 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $24,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and (iv) travel and
shareholder relation costs of $32,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $63,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2015. We anticipate the non-stock option compensation general and administrative costs will be incurred at
a comparable rate to the rate in the three months ended September 30, 2016 for the remainder of 2016. 

We recorded stock option expense
for the amortization of unvested grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital of $218,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared $156,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the holders of options to acquire our common stock voluntarily surrendered for cancellation all options previously
granted to such persons and we cancelled the options upon surrender. Upon cancellation we recorded an additional $721,000 of non-cash
stock option compensation expense for the unamortized grant date fair value as of the date of cancellation. As of September 30,
2016 there are no outstanding options under either the 2006 Plan or the 2013 Plan, as further described in Note 9,  Employee
Stock Compensation Plans,  above. 

During the three
months ended September 30, 2016 we sold marketable equity securities for proceeds of $16,000 and recorded a gain on the sales of
$10,000, compared to sales of marketable equity security sales for proceeds of $519,000 and a recorded gain on the sales of $364,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we sold 160,000 shares of Kinross
for net proceeds of $290,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $178,000. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2015 we transferred all 15,732,274 shares of Ely common stock we previously held in exchange for cancellation of certain payment
obligations related to MH-LLC, and the Ely Consent. We recorded a loss on sale of marketable equity securities of $1,511,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015 on the transfer of these Ely shares. During 2015, the sales of marketable equity securities
were a significant source of our cash needs prior to the Transaction, which was not the case during 2016. We anticipate we will
continue to sell some of our holdings of marketable equity securities during the remainder of 2016 related to our overall cash
management strategy. 

As a result of
the purchase of the Vendetta units, we adjust the fair value of the Vendetta Warrants at each balance sheet date, based upon a
Black-Scholes model. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $91,000 related
to the Vendetta Warrants, with no similar item in the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September
30, 2016 we recorded a gain on derivative instruments related to our Kinross calls of $72,000 compared to a gain on derivative
instruments during 2015 of $1,000. Given that the current price of Kinross has been in excess of the exercise price as of September
30, 2016, our covered calls may be called during the remainder of 2016. We may also exchange the existing Kinross calls for new
calls with an extend price and or increased exercise price during the remainder of 2016 as market conditions warrant. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30,
2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

We had a net loss of $1,770,000 or
$0.05 per basic and diluted shared for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $9,359,000 or $0.24 per
basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As explained in more detail above, the primary reasons for
the change from net income to a net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net income in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was the sale of our interest in MH-LLC for cash of $24,000,000 during the three months ended September
30, 2015, without a comparable sale in 2016. In addition, as explained in more detail below, our loss for the 2016 period was as
a result of (i) an increase in our exploration expense to $474,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
exploration expense of $48,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (ii) an increase in non-cash stock option compensation
expense, included in general and administrative expenses to $970,000 including expenses related to the cancellation of options
of $721,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to non-cash stock option compensation expense of 470,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (iii) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a property abandonment
and impairment loss of $10,000 and a loss on sale of assets of $14,000, both related to our decision to close our Mexican exploration
office, discussed above, with no similar item during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; and (iii) a decrease in the gain
on warrant liability to $4,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $49,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. These causes of our net loss during 2016 period were partially offset by (i) a reduction in our non-stock
option general and administrative costs to $941,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to general and administrative
costs of $1,043,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (ii) we recorded interest income of $40,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,000 of interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (iii) we
recorded an income tax benefit of $264,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of $997,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (iv) we recorded a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of $40,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss on sale of marketable equity securities of $969,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015; and (v) a gain on derivative instruments of $295,000 during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $84,000 recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Our net exploration expense increased
to $474,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $48,000 in the comparable period of 2015. See the discussion
of the comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 above. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, prior to the Transaction, we capitalized $1,382,000 of development costs related to Mt.
Hamilton. 

General and administrative costs,
excluding stock option compensation costs discussed below, were $941,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $1,043,000 in the same period of 2015. The major components of the costs were (i) salaries and benefit expense during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 of $631,000 compared to salaries and benefit expense of $657,000 in the same period of 2015; (ii)
legal and accounting expenditures of $90,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $137,000 in the same period
of 2015; (iii) other costs of $66,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $74,000 in the same period of
2015; and (iv) travel and shareholder relation costs of $154,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $176,000
in the same period of 2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded $970,000 of non-cash stock option expense with a credit to additional paid-in capital for the amortization
of unvested grant date fair value, including $721,000 of non-cash stock option expense of unamortized grant date fair value upon
the cancellation of options, compared to $470,000 of non-cash stock option expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
See Note 9,  Employee Stock Compensation Plans,  above for a further discussion of our stock option activity during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

As discussed above,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we transferred all 15,732,274 shares of Ely common stock we previously held in
exchange for cancellation of certain payment obligations related to MH-LLC, and the Ely Consent. We recorded a loss on sale of
marketable equity securities of $1,511,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 on the transfer of these Ely shares,
which accounted for the bulk of the loss during 2015, which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of Kinross stock during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $542,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $56,000 of marketable
equity securities and recorded a gain on sale of $40,000 on the sale of these securities. 

As a result of
the classification of the RMB Warrants as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40,  Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity,  we adjusted the fair value of the warrants at each balance sheet date, with changes in value
recorded in other income/expense in the statement of operations based upon a Black-Scholes model. The RMB Warrants expired on August
21, 2016 and have no remaining value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a gain of $4,000 related to the
RMB warrants as a result of the expiration of the RMB Warrants, compared to a gain of $49,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015 for the change in fair values discussed above. 

We regularly perform evaluations
of our mineral property assets to assess the recoverability of our investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable utilizing
guidelines based upon future net cash flows from the asset as well as our estimates of the geological potential of early stage
mineral property and its related value for future sale, joint venture or development by us or others. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 we recorded a loss on other assets of $14,000 and property abandonment expense of $10,000 related to the closure
of our exploration office in Mexico. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we recorded a gain of $7,000 on the disposal
of other assets and no property impairments. 

As discussed above under the comparision
of the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a deferred tax
benefit in the statement of operations for the amount of the deferred taxes recorded in other comprehensive income of $264,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As discussed above, we recorded income tax expense for continuing operations of
$997,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the allocation of income tax between continuing and discontinued
operations. 

(d) Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash   

 As of September 30, 2016 we have
$307,000 in cash. We intend to utilize a portion of this cash in our exploration activities and the potential acquisition of mineral
properties and other assets over the next several years. We may also use a portion of this cash to repurchase shares of our common
stock, pursuant to the terms of a stock buy-back program announced on October 28, 2015. The stock buy-back program may be terminated
at any time and does not require Solitario to purchase a minimum number of shares. 

Short-term Investments  

 As of September 30, 2016, we have
$7,006,000 of our current assets in United States Treasury securities ( USTS ) with maturities of 15 days to one year.
The USTS are recorded at their fair value, based upon quoted market prices. The USTS are highly liquid and may be sold in their
entirety at any time at their quoted market price and are classified as a current asset. We anticipate we will roll over that
portion of our USTS not used for operating costs or mineral property acquisitions as they mature during the remainder of 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, we have
$8,500,000 in separate bank certificates of deposit ( CDs ) each with a maximum value of $250,000, each of which is
covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance to the full face value of the CDs. At September 30, 2016, the CDs have
maturities of between 15 days and two years. The CDs are recorded at their fair value, based upon quoted market prices. The CDs
are highly liquid and may be sold in their entirety at any time at their quoted market price and are classified as a current asset.
We anticipate we will roll over that portion of our CDs not used for operating costs or mineral property acquisitions as they mature
during the remainder of 2016. 

Marketable Equity Securities  

 Our marketable equity securities
are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon market quotes of the underlying securities.
We owned 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock at September 30, 2016. The Kinross shares are recorded at their fair value of $421,000
at September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we purchased 7,240,000 units of Vendetta for an aggregate
purchase price of $289,000. Each unit consists of one share of Vendetta common stock and one Vendetta Warrant. As of September
30, 2016 we have recorded our investment in the common shares of Vendetta at their fair market value of $664,000 based upon quoted
market prices. In addition we own other marketable equity securities with a fair value of $13,000 as of September 30, 2016 based
upon quoted market prices. Changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities are recorded as gains and losses in other
comprehensive income in shareholders  equity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a net gain on marketable
equity securities in other comprehensive income of $449,000, which was net of deferred taxes of $264,000. 

Working Capital  

We had working capital of $16,812,000
at September 30, 2016 compared to working capital of $17,811,000 as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital at September 30,
2016 consists primarily of our cash and cash equivalents, our investment in USTS and CDs, discussed above, and our marketable equity
securities of $1,098,000, less our accounts payable of $140,000 and the fair value of our Kinross calls, discussed above, of $56,000.
As of September 30, 2016, our cash balances along with our short-term investments and marketable equity securities are adequate
to fund our expected expenditures over the next year. 

The nature of the mineral exploration
business requires significant sources of capital to fund exploration, development and operation of mining projects. We expect we
will need additional capital if we decide to develop or operate any of our current exploration projects or any projects or assets
we may acquire. We anticipate we would finance any such development through the use of our cash reserves, short-term investments,
joint ventures, issuance of debt or equity, or the sale of other exploration projects or assets. 

Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the holders of options to acquire our common stock voluntarily surrendered for cancellation all options previously granted
to such persons pursuant to the 2013 Plan and the 2006 Plan. Solitario cancelled the options upon surrender. As a result, there
are no outstanding options under either the 2006 Plan or the 2013 Plan. See Note 9,  Employee Stock Compensation Plans, 
above for a discussion of the activity in our 2013 Plan and our 2006 Plan during 2016. We do not anticipate the exercise of options
during the remainder of 2016 will be a significant source of cash. 

Share Repurchase Program  

On October 28, 2015, our Board of
Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes us to purchase up to two million shares of our outstanding common
stock through December 31, 2016. All shares purchased have been cancelled and reduced the number of shares of outstanding common
stock. The amount and timing of any shares purchased has been and will be determined by our management and the purchases will
be effected in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based upon market conditions and other factors, including
price, regulatory requirements and capital availability and in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. Purchases
may also be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).
The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares of common stock by the Company, and may be
suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. No purchases will be made outside of the United States,
including on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Payment for shares of common stock repurchased under the program will be funded using
the Company s working capital. As of September 30, 2016, we have purchased a total of 569,000 shares for an aggregate purchase
price of $281,000 under the share repurchase program and these shares are no longer included in our issued and outstanding shares. 

(e) Cash Flows 

Net cash used in continuing operations
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $1,436,000 compared to $1,253,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in exploration expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease in non-stock option
general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared the same period of 2015. In addition
we used approximately $190,000 from discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was related
to our Mt. Hamilton project prior to the Transaction. Based upon projected expenditures in our 2016 budget, we anticipate continued
use of funds from operations through the remainder of 2016. See  Results of Operations  discussed above for further
explanation of some of these variances. 

We used $15,761,000 in cash from
investing activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the provision of $24,894,000
of cash from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary use of cash during 2016 was for
the net purchase of $7,018,000 of CDs and $8,500,000 of USTS, discussed above under  Short-term Investments  in  Liquidity
and Capital Resources.  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $289,000 for the purchase of
units of Vendetta, discussed above under  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  and we used $40,000 for the purchase of
royalties on certain non-producing mineral leases in the state of Montana, previously owned by Atna Resources Ltd. We received
$56,000 from the sale of marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $809,000 from
the sale of marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, when we were utilizing the funds from
the sale of marketable equity securities as a significant source of operating funds prior to the Transaction. The receipt of $24,000,000
from the sale of MH-LLC in the Transaction accounted for the majority of the funds received from investing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations of $1,059,000 was
primarily related to capitalized development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, prior to the Transaction. We
do not anticipate significant additional uses of cash during the remainder of 2016 from investing activities, pending the purchase
of any additional exploration projects which if they occur, would be funded from the sale of our short-term investments. 

We used $214,000 for the purchase
of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as discussed above discussed above under  Share Repurchase
Program  in  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we used $5,000,000
of the funds from the Transaction to repay our RMB Loan. We anticipate we may use of funds for additional purchases of our common
stock during the remainder of 2016, however, this is not expected to be a significant use of funds and the will be limited to the
maximum number of shares, pursuant to the share repurchase program. 

(f) Off-balance sheet arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 we have no off-balance sheet obligations. 

(g) Development Activities, Exploration Activities,
Environmental Compliance and Contractual Obligations  

As a result of the Transaction we
are no longer involved in any development activities, nor do we have any contractual obligations related to the development of
Mt. Hamilton as of September 30, 2016. There have been no changes to our exploration activities, environmental compliance or other
contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Management s Discussion and Analysis included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

(h) Discontinued Projects  

 During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we closed our exploration office in Mexico. We sold our Norcan and Aconchi exploration projects in Mexico for a retained
a 1% royalty on both the Norcan and Aconchi properties. We recorded a mineral property write-down of $10,000 related to the Norcan
and Aconchi properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition we recorded a loss on other assets in Mexico
of $14,000 related to the exit from our exploration activities in Mexico during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

We did not record any mineral property
write-downs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

  (i) Critical Accounting Estimates  

Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation
of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have not adopted any additional accounting policies. 

(j) Related Party Transactions  

As of September 30, 2016, and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have no related party transactions or balances. 

(k) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

30, 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-17. See Note 1,  Business and Significant Accounting Policies,  above.
