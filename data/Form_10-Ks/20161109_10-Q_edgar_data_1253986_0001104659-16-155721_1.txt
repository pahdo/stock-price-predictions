   Forward Looking Statements   
     
   The information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.  We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.   
     
  This report contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the operating performance of our investments and financing needs. We use words such as  anticipates,   expects,   believes,   intends,   should,   will,   may  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words.  Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe future plans and strategies, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information.  Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results.  Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically; adverse changes in the financing markets we access affecting our ability to finance our loan and investment portfolio; adverse changes in our status with government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) affecting our ability to originate loans through GSE programs; changes in interest rates; the quality and size of the investment pipeline and the rate at which we can invest our cash; impairments in the value of the collateral underlying our loans and investments; changes in federal and state laws and regulations, including changes in tax laws; the availability and cost of capital for future investments; and competition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements, which reflect management s views as of the date of this report.  The factors noted above could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement.  
     
  Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties we face is contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ), Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 22, 2016 and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.  
     
  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results.

   Note 1   Description of Business   
     
  Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a Maryland corporation that was formed in 2003 and is externally managed and advised by Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC ( ACM  or our  Manager ).  We invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity. In addition, we may also directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. We refer to this platform as our Structured Loan Origination and Investment Business, or  Structured Business.  As a result of the acquisition of the agency platform of our Manager on July 14, 2016 (the  Acquisition ), we also now originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac,  and together with Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored enterprises, or the  GSEs ), the Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ), Federal Housing Authority ( FHA ) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( together with GNMA and FHA,  HUD ) and the conduit/commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) programs. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing ( DUS ) lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Multifamily Conventional Loan lender, seller/servicer, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, a Freddie Mac affordable, manufactured housing, senior housing and small balance loan ( SBL ) lender, seller/servicer, nationally and a HUD Map and Lean senior housing/healthcare lender nationally. We refer to this platform as our Agency Loan Origination and Servicing Business, or  Agency Business.  See Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform for further details about the Acquisition.  
     
  Substantially all of our operations are conducted through our operating partnership, Arbor Realty Limited Partnership ( ARLP ), and ARLP s subsidiaries.  We organize and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Acquisition, we operate in two segments: Structured Business and Agency Business. See Note 23   Segment Information for further details.  
     
   Note 2   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), for interim financial statements and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.  The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report, which was filed with the SEC.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include our financial statements, our wholly owned subsidiaries, and partnerships or other joint ventures in which we own a voting interest of greater than 50 percent, and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) of which we are the primary beneficiary.  VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that (i) has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Current accounting guidance requires us to present (a) assets of a consolidated VIE that can be used  only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (b) liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.  Entities in which we have significant influence are accounted for primarily under the equity method.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   
     
  As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of our distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset, income, distribution, ownership and administrative tests are met. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain other requirements. We may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes. Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on our undistributed taxable income. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distributions to our stockholders. We believe that all of the criteria to maintain our REIT qualification have been met for the applicable periods, but there can be no assurance that these criteria will continue to be met in subsequent periods.  
     
  The Agency Business is operated through a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), which is a part of our TRS consolidated group (the  TRS Consolidated Group ) and may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.  In general, our TRS entities may hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and may engage in real estate or non-real estate-related business.   Our TRS Consolidated Group has federal net operating losses from prior years which will be applied against the income from the Agency Business.  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a tax provision of $0.3 million related to state income tax liability.  Current and deferred taxes are recorded on the portion of earnings (losses) recognized by us with respect to our interest in TRSs. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between our U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements and the federal, state, local tax basis of assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheets.   We recorded a deferred tax liability of $14.8 million in connection with the Acquisition, which is included in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the seller financing portion of the consideration paid for the Acquisition. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets (e.g., net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards) and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider estimates of expected future taxable income, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook. 
     
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
     
    Significant Accounting Policies    
     
   See Item 8     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2015 Annual Report for a description of our significant accounting policies. In connection with the Acquisition, we have adopted the following additional significant accounting policies. 
     
   Loans Held-for-Sale, Net   
     
  Loans held-for-sale, net represents commercial real estate loans originated in our Agency Business, which are generally transferred or sold within 60 days from the date that the mortgage loan is funded. Such loans are reported at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis and include the value allocated to the associated future mortgage servicing rights. During the period prior to its sale, interest income on a loan held-for-sale is calculated in accordance with the terms of the individual loan and the loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred until the loan is sold.  
     
  Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated, put presumptively beyond the reach of the entity, even in bankruptcy, (2) the transferee (or if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and the entity is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives, each third-party holder of its beneficial interests) has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets, and (3) we or our agents does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets or third-party beneficial interest related to those transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. We have determined that all loans sold have met these specific conditions and accounts for all transfers of mortgage loans as completed sales.  
     
   Capitalized Mortgage Servicing Rights   
     
  We recognize, as separate assets, rights to service mortgage loans for others, including such rights that are created by the origination of mortgage loans that are sold with the servicing rights retained by the originator. Income from mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. This commitment asset is recognized at fair value, which reflects the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan. When a mortgage loan is sold, we retain the right to service the loan and recognize the MSR at the initial capitalized valuation. We amortize MSRs using the amortization method, which requires the MSRs to be amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing

  income or net servicing loss and that the servicing assets or liabilities be assessed for impairment, or increased obligation, based on the fair value at each reporting date. Amortization of MSRs is recorded as a reduction of servicing revenues, net on the consolidated statements of income. The following assumptions were used in calculating each loan s MSR for the periods presented:  
     
   Key rates:     We used discount rates ranging from 8% to 18%, representing a weighted average discount rate of 13%, based on management s best estimate of market discount rates to determine the present value of MSRs. The inflation rate used for adequate compensation was 3%. 
     
   Servicing Cost:     The estimated future cost to service the loan for the estimated life of the MSR is subtracted from the estimated future cash flows. 
     
   Estimated Life:     We estimate the life of our MSRs based upon the stated yield maintenance and/or prepayment protection term of the underlying loan and may be reduced by 6 to 12 months based upon the expiration of various types of prepayment penalty and/or lockout provisions prior to that stated maturity date. 
     
  We carry MSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and evaluate the carrying value for impairment on a portfolio basis quarterly. Fair values are estimated considering market prices for similar MSRs, when available, and by estimating the present value of the future net cash flows of the capitalized MSRs, net of adequate compensation for servicing. Adequate compensation is based on the market rate of similar servicing contracts. We estimate the terms of commercial servicing for each loan by assuming that servicing would not end prior to the yield maintenance date, if applicable, at which point the prepayment penalty expires. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. We engage an independent third party to assist in determining an estimated fair value of our MSR portfolio on a quarterly basis.  
     
  We measure the impairment of MSRs based on the difference between the aggregate carrying amount of the MSRs and their aggregate fair value. For purposes of impairment evaluation, the MSRs are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, which we have identified as loan type, note rate and yield maintenance provisions. To the extent that the carrying value of the MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established.  
     
  We record write-offs of MSRs related to the loans that were repaid prior to the expected maturity and loans that have defaulted and determined to be unrecoverable. When this occurs, the write-off is recorded as a direct write-down to the carrying value of MSRs and is included as a component of servicing revenue, net on the statements of income. This direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSRs, precluding recognition of subsequent recoveries.  
     
   Derivative Assets and Liabilities   
     
  Our rate lock and forward sales commitments associated with the Agency Business meet the definition of a derivative and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value of rate lock commitments includes the effects of interest rate movements as well as the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan which is recorded as income from mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated statements of income. The estimated fair value of forward sale commitments includes the effects of interest rate movements between the trade date and balance sheet date. Adjustments to the fair value are reflected as a component of other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.  
     
   Business Combinations   
     
   Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.  The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed made during the measurement period are recorded in the period in which the adjustment is identified, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. If any adjustments are made subsequent to the measurement period, which could be up to one year after the acquisition date, these adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of income. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.  
     
   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   
     
  Significant judgement is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective estimated useful lives. Accordingly, we typically seek the assistance of independent third party valuation specialists for significant intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management.

Table of Contents   
     
   ARBOR REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   
     
  We generally use an income based valuation method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined and deemed reasonable by management. For intangible assets related to acquired technology, we use the replacement cost method to determine fair value.  
     
  Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets also requires judgment. Certain intangible assets, such as GSE licenses, have been deemed to have indefinite lives while other intangible assets, such as broker and borrower relationships, above/below market rent and acquired technology have been deemed to have finite lives. Our assessment as to which intangible assets are deemed to have finite or indefinite lives is based on several factors including economic barriers of entry for the acquired product lines, scarcity of available GSE licenses, technology life cycles, retention trends and our operating plans, among other factors.  
     
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, while finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets on a straight-line basis.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In addition, with respect to goodwill, an impairment analysis is performed at least annually. We have elected to make the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value. If, based on that assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, then a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed.  
     
   Allowance for Loss-Sharing Obligations   
     
  When a loan is sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we undertake an obligation to partially guarantee the performance of the loan. Generally, we are responsible for losses equal to the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance ( UPB ) and a portion of any additional losses to an overall maximum of 20% of the original principal balance. Fannie Mae bears any remaining loss. In addition, under the terms of the master loss-sharing agreement with Fannie Mae, we are responsible for funding 100% of mortgage delinquencies (principal and interest) and servicing advances (taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs) until the amounts advanced exceeds 5% of the UPB at the date of default. Thereafter, we may request interim loss-sharing adjustments which allow us to fund 25% of such advances until final settlement.  
     
  At inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guaranty is recognized. In determining the fair value of the guaranty obligation, we consider the risk profile of the collateral and the historical loss experience in our portfolio. The guaranty obligation is removed only upon either the expiration or settlement of the guaranty.  
     
  We evaluate the allowance for loss-sharing obligations by monitoring the performance of each loss-sharing loan for events or conditions which may signal a potential default. Historically, initial loss recognition occurs at or before a loan becomes 60 days delinquent. In instances where payment under the guaranty on a specific loan is determined to be probable and estimable (as the loan is probable of foreclosure or is in foreclosure), we record a liability for the estimated allowance for loss-sharing (a  specific reserve ) by transferring the guarantee obligation recorded on the loan to the specific reserve with any adjustments to this reserve amount recorded in provision for loss sharing in the statements of income, along with a write-off of the associated loan-specific MSR. The amount of the allowance considers our assessment of the likelihood of repayment by the borrower or key principal(s), the risk characteristics of the loan, the loan s risk rating, historical loss experience, adverse situations affecting individual loans, the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral, and the level of risk sharing. We regularly monitor the specific reserves on all applicable loans and update loss estimates as current information is received.  
       
   Revenue Recognition   
     
  Fee-based services related to our Agency Business includes commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees, loan origination fees and gains on sale of loans. In some instances, the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed, an origination fee, net of any direct loan origination costs incurred, which is

  recognized upon sale of the loan. Revenue recognition occurs when the related services are performed, unless significant contingencies exist, and for the sale of loans, when all the incidence of ownership passes to the buyer. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans held-for-sale.  
     
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
     
   In August 2016, the  Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended its guidance to reflect eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and requires adoption on a retrospective basis, unless it is impracticable for us to apply, in which case, we would be required to apply the amendment prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based  on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Companies will be required to use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. This updated guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses. The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
     
  In March 2016, the FASB amended its guidance on stock compensation, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2017 and we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for equity method investments. Among other things, the amended guidance eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2017 and we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
   In February 2016, the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for leases that requires an entity to recognize balance sheet assets and liabilities for leases with terms of more than 12 months and also requires disclosure of key information about an entity s leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2019 with early    adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
     
  In January 2016, the FASB amended its guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.  The amended guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair

  value recognized in net income. This update also, among other things, eliminates the requirement for an entity to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2018 and we are currently evaluating the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB amended its revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the amended guidance outlines a framework for a single comprehensive model that entities can use when accounting for revenue and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including that which pertains to specific industries such as homebuilding (e.g., sales of real estate, etc.). The core principle states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods and services. It also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures that will enable the users of an entity s financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the first quarter of 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
     
    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In September 2015, the FASB amended its guidance on measurement-period adjustments arising from business combinations.  The guidance was effective for the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2015, the FASB amended its guidance on the consolidation analysis of VIEs.  The guidance was effective for the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 15   Variable Interest Entities for further details.  
     
    Note 3    Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform   
     
  On July 14, 2016, we completed the previously announced Acquisition pursuant to an asset purchase agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) dated February 25, 2016. The aggregate purchase price was $275.8 million, which was paid with $138.0 million in stock, $87.8 million in cash and with the issuance of a $50.0 million seller financing instrument. The equity component of the purchase price was paid with 21,230,769 operating partnership units ( OP Units ), which was based on a stock price of $6.50 per share. The closing price of our common stock on the day of the Acquisition was $7.29 per share; therefore, the estimated fair value of the total consideration given to our Manager was $292.5 million.  Each of these OP Units are paired with one share of our Special Voting Preferred Shares, which provides ACM with one vote per share on any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The OP Units are entitled to receive distributions if and when our Board of Directors authorizes and declares future common stock distributions. The OP Units are also redeemable for cash, or at our option, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.  See Note 12   Debt Obligations for further details about the seller financing and Note 18   Equity for further details about the OP Units. 
     
  All ACM employees directly related to the Agency Business (approximately 235) have become our employees as of the Acquisition date. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we have a two year option to purchase the existing management agreement and fully internalize our management structure for $25.0 million (increasing to $27.0 million in the second year). The exercise of this option is at the discretion of the special committee of our Board of Directors, which has no obligation to exercise its option.  
     
  We performed a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We have not finalized the analysis of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed. However, we are continuing our review of these items during the measurement period and any further changes to the preliminary purchase price allocation will be recognized as the valuations are finalized, which could change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocations are summarized as follows:

In connection with the Acquisition, we recorded goodwill as a result of the total consideration exceeding the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Goodwill was attributed to our Agency Business as it relates to the assets we acquired in the Acquisition. See Note 4   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further details about the identified intangible assets.  
     
  The total revenues and pre-tax income associated with the Agency Business from the date of Acquisition, which is included in the consolidated statements of income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $34.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively.  
     
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the revenues and earnings of the combined entity, as if the Acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated financial results of operations that would have been reported had the Acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2015 and should not be taken as indicative of our future consolidated results of operations.  

In connection with the Acquisition, we incurred legal and advisory fees totaling $6.4 million and $10.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and fees totaling $14.7 million to date. We do not expect to recognize any significant additional fees in connection with the Acquisition.

   Note 5   Loans and Investments   
     
  The following tables set forth the composition of our structured loan and investment portfolio:  

(1)    Weighted Average Pay Rate  is a weighted average, based on the UPB of each loan in our portfolio, of the interest rate that is required to be paid monthly as stated in the individual loan agreements.  Certain loans and investments that require an additional rate of interest  Accrual Rate  to be paid at the maturity are not included in the weighted average pay rate as shown in the table.  
     
  (2)   The  First Dollar LTV Ratio  is calculated by comparing the total of our senior most dollar and all senior lien positions within the capital stack to the fair value of the underlying collateral to determine the point at which we will absorb a total loss of our position.  
     
  (3)   The  Last Dollar LTV Ratio  is calculated by comparing the total of the carrying value of our loan and all senior lien positions within the capital stack to the fair value of the underlying collateral to determine the point at which we will initially absorb a loss.  
     
   During the first quarter of 2015, we acquired a $116.0 million defaulted first mortgage, at par, that paid off in the subsequent quarter resulting in the recognition of income totaling $6.7 million, net of fees and expenses. The $6.7 million of income consisted of other interest income totaling $7.9 million, partially offset by $1.2 million of expenses related to this transaction that were recorded in employee compensation and benefits. In the second quarter  of 2016, additional funds held in escrow from the note payoff were released following an arbitration proceeding and we recognized income totaling $1.9 million, net of fees and expenses. The $1.9 million of income consisted of other interest income totaling $2.5 million, partially offset by $0.6 million of expenses related to the transaction that were recorded in employee compensation and benefits.  
     
    Concentration of Credit Risk    
     
  Commercial mortgage loans and investments can potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk.   We are subject to concentration risk in that, at September 30, 2016, the UPB related to 34 loans with five different borrowers represented 18% of total assets.  At December 31, 2015, the UPB related to 22 loans with five different borrowers represented 22% of total assets.  We measure our relative loss position for our mezzanine loans, junior participation loans, and preferred equity investments by determining the point where we will be exposed to losses

Table of Contents   
     
   ARBOR REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   
     
  based on our position in the capital stack as compared to the fair value of the underlying collateral.  We determine our loss position on both a first dollar loan-to-value ( LTV ) and a last dollar LTV basis.  
     
  We assign a credit risk rating to each loan and investment.  Individual ratings range from one to five, with one being the lowest risk and five being the highest.  Each credit risk rating has benchmark guidelines that pertain to debt-service coverage ratios, LTV ratios, borrower strength, asset quality, and funded cash reserves.  Other factors such as guarantees, market strength, remaining loan term, and borrower equity are also reviewed and factored into determining the credit risk rating assigned to each loan.  This metric provides a helpful snapshot of portfolio quality and credit risk.  Given our asset management approach, however, the risk rating process does not result in differing levels of diligence contingent upon credit rating.  That is because all portfolio assets are subject to the level of scrutiny and ongoing analysis consistent with that of a  high-risk  loan.  Assets are subject to, at minimum, a thorough quarterly financial evaluation in which historical operating performance and forward-looking projections are reviewed.  Generally speaking, given our typical loan and investment profile, a risk rating of three suggests that we expect the loan to make both principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, and is not considered impaired.  A risk rating of four indicates we anticipate that the loan will require a modification of some kind.  A risk rating of five indicates we expect the loan to underperform over its term, and there could be loss of interest and/or principal.  Ratings of 3.5 and 4.5 generally indicate loans that have characteristics of both the immediately higher and lower classifications.  Further, while the above are the primary guidelines used in determining a certain risk rating, subjective items such as borrower strength, condition of the market of the underlying collateral, additional collateral or other credit enhancements, or loan terms, may result in a rating that is higher or lower than might be indicated by any risk rating matrix.  
     
  As a result of the loan review process at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we identified loans and investments that we consider higher-risk loans that had a carrying value, before loan loss reserves, of $152.1 million and $154.7 million, respectively, and a weighted average last dollar LTV ratio of 94% and 99%, respectively.  
     
  A summary of the loan portfolio s weighted average internal risk ratings and LTV ratios by asset class is as follows:

    Geographic Concentration Risk    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, 26%, 15%, 15% and 13% of the outstanding balance of our loan and investment portfolio had underlying properties in New York, Florida, California and Texas, respectively.  As of December 31, 2015, 34%, 14%, 14% and 12% of the outstanding balance of our loan and investment portfolio had underlying properties in New York, Florida, California and Texas, respectively.  
     
    Impaired Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses    
     
  We perform an evaluation of the loan portfolio quarterly to assess the performance of our loans and whether a reserve for impairment should be recorded.  We consider a loan impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and accrued interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  
     
  A summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses is as follows:  

During the second quarter of 2016, we received a $1.8 million discounted payoff on an impaired bridge loan with an aggregate carrying value before reserves of $4.8 million, resulting in the recognition of an additional provision for loan losses of $0.1 million and a charge-off of $3.0 million.  
     
   The provision for loan losses recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was comprised of two loans and four loans, respectively, with aggregate carrying values before reserves of $117.2 million and $130.2  million, respectively. The provision for loan losses recorded in the nine month period included a loan that was transferred to real estate owned with a carrying value before reserves of $8.3 million.  
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we charged-off $32.0 million of previously recorded reserves due to the write-off of a fully reserved junior participation loan. We also charged-off $2.5 million in connection with the transfer of an office building by deed in lieu of foreclosure to real estate owned, net.  
     
  A summary of charge-offs and recoveries by asset class are as follows:

   September 30, 2016   

There were no loans for which the fair value of the collateral securing the loan was less than the carrying value of the loan for which we had not recorded a provision for loan loss as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
   We have six loans with a carrying value totaling $120.2 million at September  30 , 2016, which mature in September 2017, that are collateralized by a land development project.  The loans do not carry a current pay rate of interest, but five of the loans with a carrying value totaling $110.9 million entitle us to a weighted average accrual rate of interest of 8.18%.  We suspended the recording of the accrual rate of interest on these loans, as these loans were impaired and we deemed the collection of this interest to be doubtful.  We have recorded cumulative allowances for loan losses of $49.1 million related to these loans as of September 30, 2016.  The loans are subject to certain risks associated with a development project including, but not limited to, availability of construction financing, increases in projected construction costs, demand for the development s outputs upon completion of the project, and litigation risk.  Additionally, these loans were not classified as non-performing as the borrower is in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the loans. 
     
  A summary of our impaired loans by asset class is as follows:  

(1) Represents the UPB of impaired loans less unearned revenue and other holdbacks and adjustments by asset class and was comprised of nine loans at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

  As of September 30, 2016, four loans with an aggregate net carrying value of $1.7 million, net of related loan loss reserves on the loans of $22.9 million, were classified as non-performing.  As of December 31, 2015, three loans with an aggregate net carrying value of less than $0.1 million, net of related loan loss reserves on the loans of $22.9 million, were classified as non-performing. Income from non-performing loans is generally recognized on a cash basis only to the extent it is received.  Full income recognition will resume when the loan becomes contractually current and performance has recommenced.  
     
  A summary of our non-performing loans by asset class is as follows:  

At September 30, 2016, we did not have any  loans contractually past due 90 days or more that are still accruing interest.  
     
  A summary of loan modifications, refinancings and/or extensions by asset class that we considered to be troubled debt restructurings were as follows:  

There were no loans in which we considered the modifications to be troubled debt restructurings that were subsequently considered non-performing as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and no additional loans were considered to be impaired due to our troubled debt restructuring analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These loans were modified to increase the total recovery of the combined principal and interest from the loan.  
     
  Given the transitional nature of some of our real estate loans, we may require funds to be placed into an interest reserve, based on contractual requirements, to cover debt service costs.   As of September 30, 2016, we had total interest reserves of $19.0 million on 74 loans with an aggregate UPB of $953.3 million.

  Loans held-for-sale, net consists of the following:  

Our loans held-for-sale, net are typically sold within 60 days of the origination date. At September 30, 2016, there were no loans that were 90 days or more past due, and there were no loans that were placed on a non-accrual status. In both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $551.8 million of loans held-for-sale, excluding $418.2 million of sales related to loans that were acquired on July 14, 2016 as part of the Acquisition, and recorded gains on sale of $9.0 million, which in included in Fee-based services, including gain on sales, net on the consolidated statements of income.   
     
   Note 7   Available-for-Sale Securities   
     
   Our available-for-sale securities generally consist of equity securities and  agency commercial mortgage interest-only securities ( Agency IOs ) from loans sold and securitized under the Freddie Mac Small Balance Loan Program ( SBL Program ).  
     
    Equity Securities    
     
  We own common stock of CV Holdings, Inc., formerly Realty Finance Corporation, which is a commercial real estate specialty finance company. In addition,  we purchased a federal home loan mortgage corporation security at a premium for $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This security bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.241% with a scheduled maturity in 2024. We sold this security in January 2016 for $1.6 million and recognized a gain of less than $0.1 million. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
     
  The following is a summary of the equity securities classified as available-for-sale:  

Agency IOs    
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we are now an approved seller/servicer under the SBL Program and we originate and sell loans to Freddie Mac, which are then pooled and securitized. Prior to the Acquisition and upon securitization of SBL Program loans, we received Agency IOs under the SBL Program that are classified as available-for-sale. We elected the fair value option for the Agency IOs, which requires changes in fair value to be recognized through earnings. We record such gains and losses to Fee-based services, including gain on sales, net on the consolidated statements of income. As a result of recent changes in the Freddie Mac SBL Program, we do not expect to receive Agency IOs from future securitizations.

   Note 8   Investments in Equity Affiliates   
     
  We account for all investments in equity affiliates under the equity method. The following is a summary of our investments in equity affiliates:  

Arbor Residential Investor LLC ( ARI )      In the first quarter of 2015, we invested $9.6 million for 50% of our Manager s indirect interest in a joint venture with a third party that was formed to invest in a residential mortgage banking business.  As a result of this transaction, we had an initial indirect interest of 22.5% in the mortgage banking business, which is subject to dilution upon attaining certain profit hurdles of the business. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $3.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $1.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, to income from equity affiliates in our consolidated statements of income related to this investment. 
     
   In the first quarter of 2015, we invested $1.7 million through ARI for a 50% non-controlling interest in a joint venture that invests in non-qualified residential mortgages purchased from the mortgage banking business s    origination platform.  We also funded $7.9 million and $4.6 million of additional mortgage purchases during 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for a total investment of $14.2 million as of September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received cash distributions of $1.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which were classified as returns of capital. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded income of $0.3 and $0.4 million, respectively, and, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a gain and loss of less than $0.1 million, respectively, to income from equity affiliates in our consolidated statements of income related to this investment.

  The summarized statements of operations for our investment in ARI are as follows:  

Lexford Portfolio      In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received distributions from this equity investment and recognized income of $0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we received a distribution from this equity investment and recognized income of $3.9 million, net of expenses. The $3.9 million of income was comprised of income from equity affiliates of $4.9 million, partially offset by $1.0 million of expenses related to this distribution that were recorded in employee compensation and benefits. See Note 21   Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties for further details. 
     
   Note 9   Real Estate Owned and Held-For-Sale   
     
  Our real estate assets were comprised of one hotel property and an office building at September 30, 2016 and three multifamily properties, two hotel properties and an office building at December 31, 2015.  
     
    Real Estate Owned    

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our hotel properties had a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 59% for each period, a weighted average daily rate of approximately $101 and $93, respectively, and a weighted average revenue per available room of approximately $60 and $55, respectively.  The operation of a hotel property is seasonal with the majority of revenues earned in the first two quarters of the calendar year.  During the second quarter of 2016, through site visits and discussion with market participants, we determined that the hotel property owned exhibited indicators of impairment and performed an impairment analysis. As a result of this impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment loss of $11.2 million.  
     
  At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our office building was fully occupied.  
     
  Our real estate assets had restricted cash balances totaling  $0.9 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, due to escrow requirements. 
     
    Real Estate Held-For-Sale

Note 11   Mortgage Servicing   
     
  At September 30, 2016, our weighted average servicing fee was 48 basis points on commercial loans with an aggregate UPB of approximately $12.6 billion. We held cash in escrow for these loans totaling $403.6 million at September 30, 2016, which is not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  These escrows are maintained in separate accounts at two federally insured depository institutions, which may exceed FDIC insured limits.  
     
  An analysis of the product and geographic concentrations that impact our servicing revenue is shown in the following tables. The UPB of loans by product and  by geographic area in our fee-based servicing portfolio as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

No other state accounted for more than 5% of UPB and related servicing revenues. We do not have any operations outside of the United States.  
     
   Note 12   Debt Obligations   
     
  We utilize various forms of short-term and long-term financing agreements to finance certain of our loans and investments, as well as other general business needs.  Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans and investments, as well as substantially all of our loans held-for-sale.

    Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)    
     
  In August 2016, we completed a collateralized securitization vehicle ( CLO VI ), issuing to third party investors three tranches of investment grade CLOs through two newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiaries totaling $250.3 million. As of the CLO closing date, the notes were secured by a portfolio of loan obligations with a face value of $275.4 million, consisting primarily of bridge loans that were contributed from our existing loan portfolio.  The financing has a three year replacement period that allows the principal proceeds and sale proceeds (if any) of the loan obligations to be reinvested in qualifying replacement loan obligations, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture.  Thereafter, the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid.  Initially, the proceeds of the issuance of the securities also included $49.6 million for the purpose of acquiring additional loan obligations for a period of up to 120 days from the closing date of the CLO.  In October 2016, the additional proceeds were fully utilized resulting in the issuer owning loan obligations with a face value of $325.0 million.  We retained a residual interest in the portfolio with a notional amount of $74.8 million.  The notes have an initial weighted average interest rate of 2.48% plus one-month LIBOR and interest payments on the notes are payable monthly.  Including certain fees and costs, the initial weighted average note rate was 3.44%.  
     
  In August 2015, we completed a collateralized securitization vehicle ( CLO V ), issuing to third party investors three tranches of investment grade CLOs through two newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiaries totaling $267.8 million, of which we purchased $12.5 million of Class C notes that we subsequently sold at par for $12.5 million.  As of the CLO closing date, the notes were secured by a portfolio of loan obligations with a face value of $302.6 million, consisting primarily of bridge loans that were contributed from our existing loan portfolio.  The financing has an approximate three year replacement period that allows the principal proceeds and sale proceeds (if any) of the loan obligations to be reinvested in qualifying replacement loan obligations, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture.  Thereafter, the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid.  Initially, the proceeds of the issuance of the securities also included $47.4 million for the purpose of acquiring additional loan obligations for a period of up to 120 days from the closing date of the CLO.  In September 2015, the additional proceeds were fully utilized resulting in the issuer owning loan obligations with a face value of $350.0 million.  We retained a residual interest in the portfolio with a notional amount of $82.3 million.  The notes have an initial weighted average interest rate of 2.44% plus one-month LIBOR and interest payments on the notes are payable monthly.  Including certain fees and costs, the initial weighted average note rate was 3.07%.  
     
  In March 2015, we completed the unwinding of CLO II, redeeming $177.0 million of our outstanding notes which were repaid primarily from the refinancing of the remaining assets within our new and existing financing facilities as well as with cash held by the  CLO and expensed $1.5 million of deferred fees in the first quarter of 2015 into interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. 
     
   In February 2015, we completed a collateralized securitization vehicle ( CLO IV ), issuing to third party investors three tranches of investment grade CLOs through two newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiaries totaling $219.0 million.

The financing has an approximate 2.5 year replacement period from closing that allows the principal proceeds and sale proceeds (if any) of the loan obligations to be reinvested in qualifying replacement loan obligations, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture.  Thereafter, the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid.  We retained a residual interest in the portfolio with a notional amount of $81.0 million.  The notes had an initial weighted average interest rate of 2.24% plus one-month LIBOR and interest payments on the notes are payable monthly.

   September 30, 2016   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate weighted average note rate for our  CLOs was 2.97% and 2.84%, respectively.  Including certain fees and costs, the weighted average note rate was 3.36% and 3.24% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
     
  We account for our CLO transactions on our consolidated balance sheet as financing facilities.  Our CLOs are VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and are consolidated in our financial statements accordingly.  The investment grade tranches are treated as secured financings, and are non-recourse to us.  
     
    Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)    
     
  In July 2015, we completed the unwind of CDO III, our last remaining CDO vehicle, redeeming $71.1 million of our outstanding notes. The notes were repaid primarily from proceeds received from the refinancing of CDO III s remaining assets within our existing financing facilities, as well as with cash held by the CDO.  We also terminated a related interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2015.   CDO III had a $100.0 million revolving note class that provided a revolving note facility, which was paid off in the first quarter of 2015. 
     
  In January 2015, we completed the unwind of CDO I and CDO II, redeeming $167.9 million of our outstanding notes. The notes were repaid primarily from proceeds received from the refinancing of CDO I and II s remaining assets within a new $150.0 million warehouse repurchase facility and our existing financing facilities, as well as with cash held by each CDO.  As a result of this transaction, we generated approximately $30.0 million in cash equity and  reduced the balance of estimated interest by $11.0 million, which resulted in recording a gain on acceleration of deferred income in the consolidated statements of income, in the first quarter of 2015. We also terminated the related basis and interest rate swaps, which resulted in a loss of $4.3 million, and expensed $0.5 million of deferred fees in the first quarter of 2015.  See Note 14   Derivative Financial Instruments for additional details. 
     
  In 2010, we re-issued our own CDO bonds we had acquired throughout 2009 with an aggregate face amount of $42.8 million as part of an exchange for the retirement of $114.1 million of our junior subordinated notes.  This transaction resulted in the recording of $65.2 million of additional CDO debt, of which $42.3 million represents the portion of our CDO bonds that were exchanged and $22.9 million represents the estimated interest due on the reissued bonds through their maturity.  In January 2015, we unwound our CDO I and CDO II vehicles and reduced the balance of estimated interest by $11.0 million and in July 2015, we unwound our CDO III vehicle and reduced the remaining balance of estimated interest by $8.2 million, recording a gain on acceleration of deferred income in the consolidated statements of income.  
     
    Senior Unsecured Notes    
     
   During 2014, we issued $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior unsecured notes due in 2021 in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of $85.4 million after deducting the issuance and underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  In connection with this offering, the underwriters exercised a portion of their overallotment option for a $7.8 million aggregate principal amount providing additional net proceeds of $7.4    million.  The notes can be redeemed by us after May 15, 2017.  The interest is paid quarterly in February, May, August and November.  Including certain fees and costs, the weighted average note rate was 8.15% and 8.12% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The debt carrying value of $94.3 million and $93.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, is net of $3.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of deferred financing fees. We used the net proceeds to make investments, to repurchase or pay liabilities and for general corporate purposes. 

Junior Subordinated Notes    
     
  The carrying value of borrowings under our junior subordinated notes was $157.7 million and $157.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is net of a deferred amount of $15.0 million and $15.5 million, respectively, that is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes and $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of deferred financing fees.  These notes have maturities ranging from March 2034 through April 2037, pay interest quarterly at a fixed or floating rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR and

    Mortgage Note Payable   Real Estate Owned    
     
  In the first quarter of 2015, we made required paydowns of $10.3 million and repaid the $20.7 million mortgage related to our multifamily properties, replacing it with two new notes payable totaling $27.2 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we sold the remaining multifamily properties and these notes payable were paid in full.  
     
    Related Party Financing    
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a $50.0 million preferred equity interest financing agreement with our Manager to finance a portion of the aggregate purchase price. The debt has a five year term with a preferred return of 7% through December 31, 2016, increasing by 1% per annum thereafter, with a maximum rate of 12%. In addition, after eighteen months, the principal balance due is scheduled to increase over time with $62.5 million due if the debt remained outstanding until the end of the five-year term. Interest expense associated with this financing is recorded using the effective yield method. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance was $50.0 million and, during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $0.8 million.  
     
    Debt Covenants    
     
   Credit Facilities and Repurchase Agreements   
     
  The credit facilities and repurchase agreements also contain various financial covenants related to the Company and/or its subsidiaries , including, but not limited to, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum net worth requirements, as well as certain other debt service coverage ratios, debt to equity ratios and minimum servicing portfolio tests.  We were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions at September 30, 2016. 
     
   CLOs   
     
  Our CLO vehicles contain interest coverage and asset overcollateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments.  If we fail these covenants in any of our CLOs, all cash flows from the applicable CLO would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding CLO bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that CLO regained compliance with such tests.  Our CLOs were in compliance with all such covenants as of  September 30, 2016, as well as on the most recent determination dates in October 2016.  In the event of a breach of the CLO covenants that could not be cured in the near-term, we would be required to fund our non-CLO expenses, including management fees and employee costs, distributions required to maintain our REIT status, debt costs, and other expenses with (i) cash on hand, (ii) income from any CLO not in breach of a covenant test, (iii) income from real property and loan assets, (iv) sale of assets, or (v) or accessing the equity or debt capital markets, if available.  We have the right to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non-performing loans out of the CLOs.  However, we may not have sufficient liquidity available to do so at such time.

  A summary of our CLO compliance tests as of the most recent determination dates in October 2016 is as follows:  

(1)      The overcollateralization ratio divides the total principal balance of all collateral in the CLO by the total principal balance of the bonds associated with the applicable ratio.  To the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security, the asset s principal balance for purposes of the overcollateralization test is the lesser of the asset s market value or the principal balance of the defaulted asset multiplied by the asset s recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies.  Rating downgrades of CLO collateral will generally not have a direct impact on the principal balance of a CLO asset for purposes of calculating the CLO overcollateralization test unless the rating downgrade is below a significantly low threshold (e.g. CCC-) as defined in each CLO vehicle. 
     
  (2)      The interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us. 
     
  A summary of our CLO overcollateralization ratios as of the determination dates subsequent to each quarter is as follows:  

(1)      The table above represents the quarterly trend of our overcollateralization ratio, however, the CLO determination dates are monthly and we were in compliance with this test for all periods presented. 
     
  The ratio will fluctuate based on the performance of the underlying assets, transfers of assets into the CLOs prior to the expiration of their respective replenishment dates, purchase or disposal of other investments, and loan payoffs.  No payment due under the junior subordinated indentures may be paid if there is a default under any senior debt and the senior lender has sent notice to the trustee.  The junior subordinated indentures are also cross-defaulted with each other.  
     
    Convertible Unsecured Senior Notes (Subsequent Event)    
     
  In October 2016, we issued $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% convertible unsecured senior notes (the  Notes ), including the underwriter s $11.25 million over-allotment option. The Notes mature on October 1, 2019, unless earlier converted or repurchased by the holders pursuant to their terms. We received proceeds of $82.8 million, net of transaction fees, from the offering which is intended to be used to make investments in our business and for general corporate purposes. The Notes pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 6.50% per year. We

  do not have the right to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. The Notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and during specified periods.  
     
  The Notes have a conversion rate of 119.3033 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $8.38 per share of common stock.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events and the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if we undergo a fundamental change as specified in the agreement.  
     
   Note 13   Allowance for Loss-Sharing Obligations   
     
  A summary of our allowance for loss-sharing obligations related to the Fannie Mae DUS program is as follows:  

When we settle a loss under the DUS loss-sharing model, the net loss is charged-off against the previously recorded loss-sharing obligation. The settled loss is often net of any previously advanced principal and interest payments in accordance with the DUS program, which are reflected as reductions to the proceeds needed to settle losses. At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding advances of $0.7 million, which were netted against the allowance for loss-sharing obligations.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, the maximum quantifiable liability associated with our guarantees under the Fannie Mae DUS agreement was $1.9 billion. The maximum quantifiable liability is not representative of the actual loss we would incur. We would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans we service for Fannie Mae, for which we retain some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement.

The changes in the fair value of qualifying  interest rate swap  cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.  These swap agreements must be effective in reducing the variability of cash flows of the hedged items in order to qualify for the aforementioned hedge accounting treatment.  These interest rate swaps are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt, and amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest

  expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one interest rate swap matured with a notional value of $1.7 million.  As of  September 30, 2016, we expect to reclassify $(1.3) million of other comprehensive loss from qualifying cash flow hedges to interest expense over the next twelve months assuming interest rates on that date are held constant.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, CDO I and CDO II were unwound and the related interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $134.6 million and an aggregate fair value of $(4.3) million were terminated and recorded as a loss in the first quarter of 2015.  See Note 12   Debt Obligations for further details.  Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we entered into a qualifying LIBOR cap hedge due to a CLO agreement requiring a LIBOR cap of 2% with a notional value of $43.5 million. 
     
  Gains and losses on terminated swaps are being deferred and recognized in earnings over the original life of the hedged item.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a net deferred loss of $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these terminated swap agreements.  We recorded $0.2 million as additional interest expense related to the amortization of the loss for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and less than $0.1 million as a reduction to interest expense related to the accretion of the net gains for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  We recorded $0.5 million as additional interest expense related to the amortization of the loss for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $0.1 million as a reduction to interest expense related to the accretion of the net gains for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We expect to record approximately $0.2 million of net deferred loss to interest expense over the next twelve months.  
     
  Non-qualifying basis swap hedges were used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet hedge accounting requirements.  D uring the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our remaining basis swap with a notional value of $3.0 million and a fair value of less than $0.1 million was terminated as part of the CDO II unwind and a loss was recorded in the nine months September 30, 2015. 
     
   The following table presents the effect of our derivative financial instruments on the statements of  income  (dollars in thousands): 

The cumulative amount of other comprehensive loss related to net unrealized losses on derivatives designated as qualifying hedges as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $(1.4) million and $(5.3) million, respectively, is a combination of the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges of $(1.2) million and $(4.7) million, respectively, and net deferred losses on terminated interest rate swaps of $(0.2) million and $(0.6) million, respectively.  
     
  We have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations.  As of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements, was $(1.1) million and $(4.6) million, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of

    Agency Business    
     
  The following is a summary of the derivative financial instruments held by our Agency Business (dollars in thousands):  

We enter into contractual commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans at fixed prices with fixed expiration dates. The commitments become effective when the borrower  rate locks  a specified interest rate within time frames established by us. All potential borrowers are evaluated for creditworthiness prior to the extension of the commitment. Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the rate lock by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to an investor. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, we enter into a forward sale commitment with the investor simultaneous with the rate lock commitment with the borrower. The forward sale contract with the investor locks in an interest rate and price for the sale of the loan. The terms of the contract with the investor and the rate lock with the borrower are matched in substantially all respects, with the objective of eliminating interest rate risk to the extent practical. Sale commitments with the investors have an expiration date that is longer than our related commitments to the borrower to allow, among other things, for the closing of the loan and processing of paperwork to deliver the loan into the sale commitment.   
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $0.2 million of net gains from changes in the fair value of these derivatives in other income, net and $16.0 million of income from mortgage servicing rights which were reflected on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 16   Fair Value for additional information related to our derivative financial instruments.  
     
   Note 15   Variable Interest Entities   
     
  We have evaluated our loans and investments, mortgage related securities, investments in equity affiliates, senior unsecured notes, junior subordinated notes, operating partnership, CLOs and Agency IOs, in order to determine if they qualify as VIEs or as variable interests in VIEs.  This evaluation resulted in determining that our bridge loans, junior participation loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity investments, investments in equity affiliates, junior subordinated notes, operating partnership, CLOs, Agency IOs and investments in mortgage related securities are potential VIEs.  
     
  Our involvement with VIEs primarily affects our financial performance and cash flows through amounts recorded in interest income, interest expense,  provision for loan losses and through activity associated with our derivative instruments.  
     
   Consolidated VIEs   
     
  In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the amended guidance  on the consolidation of VIEs, modifying the analysis we must perform to determine whether we should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  Under the revised guidance, our operating partnership, ARLP, was determined to be a VIE.  As this operating partnership is already consolidated in our financial statements, the identification of this entity as a VIE has no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as all of our assets and liabilities are held in this consolidated VIE. 
     
  Our CLO subsidiaries, of which we are the primary beneficiary and qualify as VIEs, are owned by our operating partnership ARLP, which is consolidated in our financial statements.  These CLOs invest in real estate and real estate-related securities and are financed by the issuance of CLO debt securities.  We, or one of our affiliates, are named collateral manager, servicer, and special servicer for all CLO collateral assets which we believe gives us the power to direct the most significant economic activities of the entity.  We also have exposure to CLO losses to the extent of our equity interests and also have rights to waterfall payments in excess of required payments to CLO bond investors.  As a result of consolidation, equity interests in these CLOs have been eliminated, and the consolidated balance sheets reflect both the assets held and debt issued by the CLOs to third parties.  Our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to CLO assets and liabilities as opposed to our net economic interests in the CLO entities.  
     
  The assets and liabilities related to these consolidated CLOs are as follows:

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   

Assets held by the CLOs are restricted and can be used only to settle obligations of the CLOs.  The liabilities of the CLOs are non-recourse to us and can only be satisfied from each CLOs respective asset pool.  See Note 12   Debt Obligations for further details.  
     
  We are not obligated to provide, have not provided, and do not intend to provide financial support to any of the consolidated CLOs.  
     
   Unconsolidated VIEs   
     
  We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of 22 VIEs in which we have a variable interest as of  September 30, 2016 because we do not have the ability to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact each entity s economic performance.  VIEs, of which we are not the primary beneficiary, have an aggregate carrying amount of $277.5 million and exposure to real estate debt of approximately $2.5 billion at September 30, 2016. 
     
  The following is a summary of our variable interests in identified VIEs, of which we are not the primary beneficiary, as of  September 30, 2016: 

(1) Represents the carrying amount of loans and investments before reserves.  At  September 30, 2016, $149.6 million of loans to VIEs had corresponding loan loss reserves of $77.6 million.  See Note 5   Loans and Investments for further details. 
     
  (2) Our maximum  exposure to loss as of September 30, 2016 would not exceed the carrying amount of its investment. 
     
  (3) It is not appropriate to consolidate these entities as equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk.  Since our investments were funded by the entities that issued the junior subordinated notes, it is not considered to be at risk.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  Fair value estimates are dependent upon subjective assumptions and involve significant uncertainties resulting in variability in estimates with changes in assumptions.  The following table summarizes the principal amounts, carrying values and the estimated fair values of our financial instruments:

Fair Value Measurement   
     
  Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.  A liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters.  Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.  These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments  complexity.  
     
  Assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.  Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows:  
     
  Level 1   Inputs are unadjusted and quoted prices exist in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date, such as government and agency securities and equities listed in active markets.  
     
  Level 2   Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life.  Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability, and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability.  Examples of Level 2 assets and liabilities include non-government securities, certain mortgage and asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt and certain derivative instruments.  
     
  Level 3   Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  These valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.  Examples of Level 3 assets and liabilities include certain mortgage and asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt and certain derivative instruments.  
     
  Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.  
     
  The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.  
     
    Loans held-for-sale, net:     Consists of originated loans that are generally transferred or sold within 60 days from the date that a mortgage loan is funded, and are valued using pricing models that incorporate observable inputs from current market assumptions (Level 2). Fair values of loans held-for-sale include the fair value allocated to the associated future mortgage servicing rights and is calculated pursuant to the valuation techniques described below for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net (Level 3).

    Loans and investments, net:     Fair values of loans and investments that are not impaired are estimated using Level 3 inputs based on discounted cash flow methodology, using discount rates, which, in the opinion of management, best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar characteristics and credit quality.  Fair values of loans and investments that are impaired are estimated using Level 3 inputs by us that require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding discount rates, capitalization rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management. 
     
    Available-for-sale securities:     Fair values are approximated based on current market quotes received from active markets or financial sources that trade such securities.  The fair values of available-for-sale equity securities traded in active markets are approximated using Level 1 inputs, while the fair values of available-for-sale debt securities that are approximated using recent purchase price and subsequent sales price of the securities, were valued using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of our Agency IOs were approximated using Level 3 inputs and are derived from third party proprietary models using discounted cash flows based on the underlying contractual cash flows and require significant judgements, including assumptions on discount rates and constant prepayment rates. 
     
    Derivative financial instruments:     Fair values of interest rate and basis swap derivatives and LIBOR caps are approximated using Level 2 inputs based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles including counterparty risks, credit spreads and interest rate projections, as well as reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Fair values of rate lock and forward sale commitments are approximated using valuation techniques, which include internally-developed models developed based on changes in the U.S. Treasury rate and other observable market data (Level 2). The fair value of rate lock commitments includes the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, see capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net below for further details on the applicable valuation technique (Level 3).  We also consider the impact of counterparty non-performance risk when measuring the fair value of these derivatives. Given the credit quality of our counterparties, the short duration of interest rate lock commitments and forward sale contracts, and our historical experience, the risk of nonperformance by our counterparties is not significant.  
     
    Capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net  :   Fair values are estimated using Level 3 inputs based on discounted future net cash flow methodology.  The fair value of MSRs carried at amortized cost are estimated using a process that involves the use of independent third-party valuation experts, supported by commercially available discounted cash flow models and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value.  The key inputs used in estimating fair value of MSRs include the contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment speed of the underlying loans, discount rate, annual per loan cost to service loans, delinquency rates, late charges and other economic factors. 
     
    Credit facilities, repurchase agreements and mortgage notes payable:     Fair values of the credit facilities and repurchase agreements for the Structured Business are estimated at Level 3 using discounted cash flow methodology, using discount rates, which, in the opinion of management, best reflect current market interest rates for financing with similar characteristics and credit quality. The majority of our credit facilities for the Agency Business bear interest at rates that are similar to those available in the market currently and the fair values are estimated using Level 2 inputs. For these facilities, the fair values approximate the carrying values reported in the balance sheets. 
     
    Related party financing:     Fair values are estimated at Level 3 based on broker quotations, representing the discounted expected future cash flows at a yield that reflects current market interest rates and credit spreads. 
     
    Collateralized loan obligations:     Fair values are estimated at Level 3 based on broker quotations, representing the discounted expected future cash flows at a yield that reflects current market interest rates and credit spreads. 
     
    Senior unsecured notes:     Fair values are estimated at Level 1 based on current market quotes received from active markets. 
     
    Junior subordinated notes:     Fair values are estimated at Level 3 based on broker quotations, representing the discounted expected future cash flows at a yield that reflects current market interest rates and credit spreads.

  We measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair value of these financial assets and liabilities was determined using the following input levels as of September 30, 2016:  

See Note 7   Available-for-Sale Securities for a roll-forward of our available-for-sale securities fair valued using Level 3 inputs.  
     
  We  measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  The fair values of these financial assets were determined using the following input levels as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)            We had an allowance for loan losses of $83.8 million relating to eight loans with an aggregate carrying value, before loan loss reserves, of $186.5 million at September 30, 2016. 
     
    Loan impairment assessments     :    Loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees, loan purchase discounts, and net of the allowance for loan losses, when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired.  We consider a loan impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We perform evaluations of our loans to determine if the value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, which may result in an allowance and corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization and discount rates, revenue growth rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management.  The table above includes all impaired loans, regardless of the period in which the impairment was recognized.

   Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies   
     
    Agency Business Commitments    
     
  The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies.  Among other things, these agencies require us to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements.  Our adjusted net worth and liquidity required by the agencies for all periods presented exceeded these requirements.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we were required to maintain at least $10.4 million of liquid assets in one of our subsidiaries to meet our operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae and we had operational liquidity in excess of this requirement.  
     
  We are generally required to share the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program and are required to secure this obligation by assigning restricted cash balances and/or a letter of credit to Fannie Mae.  The amount of collateral required by Fannie Mae is a formulaic calculation at the loan level by a Fannie Mae assigned tier which considers the balance of the loan, the risk level of the loan, the age of the loan and the level of risk-sharing. Fannie Mae requires restricted liquidity for Tier 2 loans of 75 basis points, 15 basis points for Tier 3 loans and 5 basis points for Tier 4 loans, which is funded over a 48-month period that begins upon delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. A significant portion of our Fannie Mae DUS serviced loans for which we have risk sharing are Tier 2 loans.  As of September 30, 2016, we met the restricted liquidity requirement with a $35.0 million letter of credit and $2.0 million of cash collateral.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, reserve requirements for the September 30, 2016 Fannie Mae DUS loan portfolio will require us to fund $21.0 million in additional restricted liquidity over the next 48 months, assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within our at-risk portfolio. Fannie Mae periodically reassesses these collateral requirements and may make changes to these requirements in the future. We generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to meet these capital standards and do not expect any changes to have a material impact on our future operations; however, future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact our available cash.  
     
  We are subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that we have entered into with secondary market investors.  Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in our inability to originate and service loans for the respective investor and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  As of September 30, 2016, we met all of Fannie Mae s quarterly capital requirements. As of September 30, 2016, our Fannie Mae adjusted net worth was in excess of the required net worth. We are not subject to capital requirements on a quarterly basis for GNMA or FHA, as such requirements for these investors are only required on an annual basis.  
     
  As an approved designated seller/servicer under Freddie Mac s SBL Program, we are required to post collateral to ensure that we are able to meet certain purchase and loss obligations required by this program. Under the SBL Program, we are required to post collateral equal to $5.0 million, which we utilize letters of credit to fund.

  In accordance with certain loans and investments, we have outstanding unfunded commitments of $32.3 million as of September 30, 2016 that we are obligated to fund as the borrowers meet certain requirements.  Of this total, we have $1.9 million in restricted cash which was available to fund all of the unfunded commitments for loans financed by our CLO vehicles.  Specific requirements include, but are not limited to, property renovations, building construction, and building conversions based on criteria met by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreements.  
     
    Litigation    
     
  We currently are neither subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, are any material litigation currently threatened against us other than the following:  
     
   On June 15, 2011, three related lawsuits were filed by the Extended Stay Litigation Trust (the  Trust ), a post-bankruptcy litigation trust alleged to have standing to pursue claims that previously had been held by Extended Stay,    Inc. and the Homestead Village L.L.C. family of companies (together  ESI ) (formerly Chapter 11 debtors, together the  Debtors ) that have emerged from bankruptcy.  Two of the lawsuits were filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and the third in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County.  There were 73 defendants in the three lawsuits, including 55 corporate and partnership entities and 18 individuals.  A subsidiary of ours and certain other entities that are affiliates of ours are included as defendants.  The New York State Court action has been removed to the Bankruptcy Court.  Our affiliates filed a motion to dismiss the three lawsuits.

   September 30, 2016   
     
  The lawsuits all allege, as a factual basis and background certain facts surrounding the June 2007 leveraged buyout of ESI from affiliates of Blackstone Capital.  Our subsidiary, Arbor ESH II, LLC, had a $115.0 million investment in the Series A1 Preferred Units of a holding company of Extended Stay, Inc.  The New York State Court action and one of the two federal court actions name as defendants, Arbor ESH II, LLC, Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC and ABT-ESI LLC, an entity in which we have a membership interest, among the broad group of defendants.  These two actions were commenced by substantially identical complaints.  The defendants are alleged in these complaints, among other things, to have breached fiduciary and contractual duties by causing or allowing the Debtors to pay illegal dividends or other improper distributions of value at a time when the Debtors were insolvent.  These two complaints also allege that the defendants aided and abetted, induced, or participated in breaches of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment ( Fiduciary Duty Claims ) and name a director of ours, and a former general counsel of Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC, each of whom had served on the Board of Directors of ESI for a period of time.  We are defending these two defendants and paying the costs of such defense.  On the basis of the foregoing allegations, the Trust has asserted claims under a number of common law theories, seeking the return of assets transferred by the Debtors prior to the Debtors  bankruptcy filing.  
     
  In the third action, filed in Bankruptcy Court, the same plaintiff, the Trust, has named Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC and ABT-ESI LLC, together with a number of other defendants and asserts claims, including constructive and fraudulent conveyance claims under state and federal statutes, as well as a claim under the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act.  
     
  On June 28, 2013, the Trust filed a motion to amend the lawsuits, to, among other things, (i) consolidate the lawsuits into one lawsuit, (ii) remove 47 defendants, none of whom are related to us, from the lawsuits so that there are 26 remaining defendants, including 16 corporate and partnership entities and 10 individuals, and (iii) reduce the counts within the lawsuits from over 100 down to 17.  The remaining counts in the amended complaint against our affiliates are principally state law claims for breach of fiduciary duties, waste, unlawful dividends and unjust enrichment, and claims under the Bankruptcy Code for avoidance and recovery actions, among others.   The bankruptcy court granted the motion and the amended complaint has been filed.  The amended complaint seeks approximately $139.0 million in the aggregate from director designees, portions of which are also sought from our affiliates as well as from unaffiliated defendants.  We have moved to dismiss the referenced actions and intend to vigorously defend against the claims asserted therein.  During a status conference held on March 18, 2014, the Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss and adjourned the case pending a ruling. 
     
  We have not made a loss accrual for this litigation because we believe that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount cannot be reasonably estimated.

Each of these OP Units are paired with one share of our Special Voting Preferred Shares having a par value of $0.01 per share and is entitled to one vote each on any matter submitted for stockholder approval, which represents approximately 29.2% of the voting power of our outstanding stock at September 30, 2016. The OP Units are entitled to receive distributions if and when our Board of Directors authorizes and declares future common stock distributions. The OP Units are also redeemable for cash, or at our option, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.

   Deferred Compensation   
     
  In March 2016, we issued 282,405 shares of restricted common stock under the 2014 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) to certain employees of ours and our Manager with a total grant date fair value of $1.9 million and recorded $0.2 million to employee compensation and benefits and $0.5 million to selling and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.  One third of the shares vested as of the date of grant, one third will vest in March 2017, and the remaining third will vest in March 2018.  In March 2016, we also issued 67,260 shares of fully vested common stock to the independent members of the Board of Directors under the 2014 Plan and recorded $0.4 million to selling and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

One quarter of the shares vested as of the date of grant and one quarter will vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.

  annual incentive agreement, Mr. Kaufman was granted in the aggregate up to 867,113 performance-based restricted stock units.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, unvested restricted stock consisted of 202,037 shares granted to our employees with a grant date fair value of $1.4 million and 195,139 shares granted to employees of our Manager with a grant date fair value of $1.3 million, which is subject to re-measurement each reporting period.  Expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period in our consolidated statements of income in employee compensation and benefits expense and selling and administrative expense, respectively.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded the ratable portion of the unvested restricted stock to employees as employee compensation and benefits for $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and for non-employees to selling and administrative expense for $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded the ratable portion of the unvested restricted stock to employees as employee compensation and benefits for $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and for non-employees to selling and administrative expense for $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2016, a total of 1,001 shares of unvested restricted stock with a grant date value of less than $0.1 million were forfeited.  
     
  Vesting of restricted shares is dependent on a service requirement.  Dividends paid on restricted shares are recorded as dividends on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested.  For accounting purposes, we measure the compensation costs for these shares as of the date of the grant, with subsequent re-measurement for any unvested shares granted to non-employees of ours with such amounts expensed against earnings, at the grant date (for the portion that vest immediately) or ratably over the respective vesting periods.  
     
   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   
     
  At September 30, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive loss was $1.1 million and consisted of $1.2 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $0.2 million of net deferred losses on terminated interest swaps, partially offset by a $0.3 million unrealized gain related to available-for-sale securities.  At December 31, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss was $4.8 million and consisted of $4.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and $0.6 million of net deferred losses on terminated interest swaps, less a $0.4 million unrealized gain related to available-for-sale securities.  
     
  Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:  

(1) See Note 14   Derivative Financial Instruments for additional details.  
     
   Note 19   Earnings Per Share   
     
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period inclusive of unvested restricted stock with full dividend participation rights.  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the additional dilutive effect of common stock equivalents during each period using the treasury stock method.  Our common stock equivalents are comprised of the weighted average dilutive effect of performance-based restricted stock units granted to our chief executive officer in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 and OP Units issued in connection with the Acquisition.

  The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations:  

(1)            Net of preferred stock dividends. 
     
  (2)            We consider OP Units to be common stock equivalents as the holder has voting rights, the right to distributions and the right to redeem the OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or a corresponding number of shares of common stock, at our election. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the OP Units were considered anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted EPS. 
     
  (3)            Mr. Kaufman was granted restricted stock units in 2016 and 2015 which vest at the end of a four-year performance period based upon our achievement of total shareholder return objectives.  See Note 18   Equity for further details. 
     
   Note 20   Employee Benefits   
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed a 401(k) defined contribution plan (the   401(k) Plan  ) and a non-qualified deferred compensation plan ( the  Deferred Comp Plan  ).  
     
  The 401(k) Plan is available to all employees who have completed six months of continuous service. The 401(k) Plan matches 25% of the first 6% of each employee s contribution. We have the option to increase the employer match based on our operating results. In both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $0.2 million of expenses associated with the 401(k) Plan.  
     
  The Deferred Comp Plan is offered to certain full-time employees and is subject to the rules of section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Deferred Comp Plan, which can be modified or discontinued at any time, participating employees may defer a portion of their compensation and we are contractually obligated to match the contribution, as specified in the Deferred Comp Plan, and fund such amounts upon vesting and an election by participants to redeem their interests. All employee deferrals vest immediately and matching contributions vest over a nine year period beginning after year five. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there

   Management Agreement   
     
  We, ARLP and Arbor Realty SR, Inc. have a management agreement with our Manager, pursuant to which our Manager provides certain services and we pay our Manager a base management fee and under certain circumstances, an annual incentive fee.  
     
  The base management fee is an arrangement whereby we reimburse our Manager for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties  agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true-ups to actual costs.  
     
  The incentive management fee is measured on an annual basis and is calculated pursuant to the terms of the management agreement.  The minimum return, or incentive fee hurdle to be reached before an incentive fee is earned, is a percentage applied on a per share basis to the greater of $10.00 or the average gross proceeds per share.  In addition, 60% of any loan loss and other reserve recoveries are eligible to be included in the incentive fee calculation, which recoveries are spread over a three year period.  
     
  The management agreement also allows us to consider, from time to time, the payment of additional  success-based  fees to our Manager for accomplishing certain specified corporate objectives; has a termination fee of $10.0 million; and is renewable automatically for successive one-year terms, unless terminated with six months prior written notice.  If we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement without cause, we are required to pay the termination fee of $10.0 million. We have a two year option to purchase the existing management agreement and fully internalize our management structure for $25.0 million (increasing to $27.0 million in the second year).  See Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform for further details. 
     
  The following table sets forth our base management fees and incentive fees:

  In June 2013, our Board of Directors formed a special committee consisting of independent directors in connection with the acquisition of our Manager s Agency Business, as well as the option to internalize the management of our current business. In February 2016, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and on July 14, 2016 we completed the Acquisition for $275.8 million. See Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform for further details.  
     
  In 2011, we restructured a preferred equity investment on the Lexford Portfolio ( Lexford ), which is a portfolio of multifamily assets. In connection with this restructuring, we, along with an executive officer of ours and a consortium of independent outside investors, made an additional preferred and direct equity investment. Both of our preferred equity investments were repaid in full by the third quarter of 2015. Interest income recorded from such preferred equity investments were $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As a result of the direct equity investment, which was also repaid in the third quarter of 2015, we received distributions totaling $5.5 million during 2015 and additional distributions of $0.7 million and $2.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which were recorded as  income from equity affiliates. In addition, under the terms of the restructuring, Lexford s first mortgage lender required a change of property manager for the underlying assets.  The new management company is owned primarily by a consortium of affiliated investors including Mr. Kaufman and an executive officer of ours, and has a contract with the new entity for 7.5 years and is entitled to 4.75% of gross revenues of the underlying properties, along with the potential to share in the proceeds of a sale or refinancing of the debt should the management company remain engaged by the new entity at the time of such capital event.  We have provided limited ( bad boy ) guarantees for certain debt controlled by Lexford.  The bad boy guarantees may become a liability for us upon standard  bad  acts such as fraud or a material misrepresentation by Lexford or us.  At September 30, 2016, this debt had an aggregate outstanding balance of $848.2 million and is scheduled to mature between 2017 and 2025. 
     
  We are dependent upon our Manager with whom we have a conflict of interest, to provide services to us that are vital to our operations.  Our chairman, chief executive officer and president, Mr. Ivan Kaufman, is also the chief executive officer and president of our Manager, and, our chief financial officer and treasurer, Mr. Paul Elenio, is the

  chief financial officer of our Manager.  In addition, Mr. Kaufman and his affiliated entities ( the Kaufman Entities ) together beneficially own approximately 92% of the outstanding membership interests of our Manager and certain of our employees and directors also hold an ownership interest in our Manager.  Furthermore, one of our former directors is general counsel to our Manager and another of our directors also serves as the trustee of one of the Kaufman Entities that holds a majority of the outstanding membership interests in our Manager and co-trustee of another Kaufman Entity that owns an equity interest in our Manager.  Our Manager holds 5,349,053 of our common shares, and upon the closing of the Acquisition in July 2016, our Manager was issued 21,230,769 OP Units, each paired with one share of our Special Voting Preferred Shares which in total represents approximately 36.6% of the voting power of our outstanding stock.  Our Board of Directors approved a resolution under our charter allowing Mr. Kaufman and our Manager, (which Mr. Kaufman has a controlling equity interest in), to own more than the 5% ownership interest limit of our common stock as stated in our charter as amended.

   Note 23   Segment Information   
     
  As a result of the Acquisition, we currently evaluate our results from operations from two major business segments   our Structured Business and our Agency Business.  See Note 1   Description of Business for a detailed description of each segment.  
     
  The summarized statements of income and balance sheet data, as well as certain other data, by segment are included in the following tables.  Specifically identifiable costs are recorded directly to each business segment. For items not specifically identifiable, costs have been allocated between the business segments using the most meaningful allocation methodologies, which was predominately direct labor costs (i.e., time spent working on each business segment). Such costs include, but are not limited to, compensation and employee related costs, selling and administrative expenses, management fees and stock-based compensation. All amounts are before amounts allocated to noncontrolling interest.

   Item 2.              Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
     
   You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, and related notes and the section entitled  Forward Looking Statements  included herein.   
     
   Overview   
     
  We invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity, which we refer to as our Structured Business.  As a result of the Acquisition, we also now originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through GSE, HUD and CMBS programs. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs. We refer to this platform as our Agency Business.  See Note 1   Description of our Business for additional details about our business segments and Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform for further details about the Acquisition. We organize and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on its REIT taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. See Note 2   Basis of Presentation for additional information.  
     
  Our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors:  
     
   Net interest income earned on our investments     Net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. If the yield on our assets increases or the cost or borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. However, if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases, this will have a negative impact on earnings. Net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio. We recognize the bulk of our net interest income from our Structured Business segment. Additionally, we recognize net interest income from loans originated through our Agency Business segment, which are generally sold within 60 days of origination. 
     
   Fees and revenue recognized from originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans through the GSE and HUD programs     Revenue recognized from the origination and sale of mortgage loans consists of commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees, loan origination fees and gains on sale of loans, net of any direct loan origination costs incurred. These fees and gains are collectively referred to as Fee-based services, including gain on sales, net. We also recognize fees and revenue from servicing mortgage loans. We record  income from mortgage servicing rights  in the consolidated statements of income  at the time of commitment to the borrower , which represents the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the rights to service mortgage loans that we originate, with the recognition of a corresponding asset upon sale. We also record Servicing revenue, net which consists of the fees received for servicing mortgage loans originated, net of amortization on the mortgage servicing rights asset recorded.  These origination, selling and servicing fees and revenue are new beginning this quarter as a result of the Acquisition and are included in our Agency Business segment. Although we have a long-established relationship with the GSE and HUD agencies, our operating performance would be negatively impacted if our business relationships with these agencies deteriorate. 
     
   Income earned from our structured transactions     Our structured transactions are primarily comprised of investments in equity affiliates, which represent unconsolidated joint venture investments formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate-related assets. Income from these investments comprised a significant portion of our operating results during 2015 and year-to-date 2016. Our joint venture investment in a residential mortgage banking business currently comprises the majority of income recognized from equity affiliates. If interest rates rise significantly in the future, it is likely that income from this investment will significantly decrease. In addition, we periodically receive distributions from our equity investments. It is difficult to forecast the timing of such payments, which can be substantial in any given quarter. We account for our structured transactions within our Structured Business segment. 
     
   Credit quality of our loans and investments, including our servicing portfolio     Effective portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of our mortgage loans and real estate-related investments.  Maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance.  Loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity.

   Recent Developments   
     
   Acquisition of our Manager s Agency Business     On July 14, 2016, we completed the Acquisition of our Manager s Agency Business for an aggregate purchase price of $275.8 million. The closing price of our common stock on the Acquisition date was $7.29 per share; therefore, the estimated fair value of the total consideration given to our Manager approximated $292.5 million. The total revenues and pre-tax income associated with the Agency Business from the date of Acquisition, which is included in the consolidated statements of income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $34.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively. We incurred legal and advisory fees totaling $6.4 million and $10.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and fees totaling $14.7 million to date in connection with this acquisition, and we do not expect to recognize any significant additional fees in connection with the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, we now operate and manage our business based on the following two business segments: Structured Business and Agency Business. See Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform and Note 23   Segment Information for additional details of the Acquisition and segments. 
     
   Loan and Investment Activity     Loan originations from our Structured Business totaled $266.6 million in the third quarter compared to partial and full loan payoffs which totaled $118.3 million. Loan originations from the Agency Business we acquired totaled $850.4 million in the third quarter. See Changes in Financial Condition below for details of our loan activity. 
     
   Financing Activity     We closed our sixth collateralized securitization vehicle (CLO VI) totaling $325.0 million of real estate related assets and cash. An aggregate of $250.3 million of investment-grade notes were issued and we retained a $74.8 million equity interest in the portfolio. In September, we entered into a three-year, $50.0 million credit facility to finance first mortgage loans on healthcare facilities that bears interest at rates ranging from 250 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed debt (comprised of credit facilities and repurchase agreements) totaling $301.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and entered into a $50.0 million preferred equity interest financing agreement with our Manager to finance a portion of the aggregate purchase price. See Note 12   Debt Obligations for further details of our debt obligations. 
     
   Equity Investment Activity     We recognized income of $3.9 million from our interest in a residential mortgage banking business and received a $1.3 million distribution from an equity investment in non-qualified residential mortgages, which was classified as a return of capital. In addition, we received a distribution from our Lexford equity investment and recognized income of $0.7 million. 
     
   Shelf Registration Statement     In July 2016, we filed, and the SEC declared effective, a new shelf registration statement for $500.0 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. 
     
   Equity Distribution Agreement     In August 2016, we amended the equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC under which we may offer and sell up to 7,500,000 common shares in  At-The-Market  equity offerings with JMP Securities LLC. We have not sold any shares under this agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
     
   Subsequent Event     In October 2016, we issued $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% convertible senior unsecured notes which mature on October 1, 2019 for net proceeds of $82.8 million.  See Note 12   Debt Obligations for additional details. 
     
   Current Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends   
     
  Our ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our portfolio of loans and investments, is dependent on many factors, including our ability to access capital and financing on favorable terms.  The previous economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers.  If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options for raising capital and obtaining financing on favorable terms and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.  
     
 55   

Table of Contents   
     
   We rely on the capital markets to generate capital for financing the growth of our business.  During the third quarter of 2016, we closed a new collateralized securitization offering, whereby we issued $250.3 million of investment-grade notes and entered into a new $50.0 million financing facility. Additionally, i n October 2016, we issued $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% convertible unsecured senior notes, including the underwriter s $11.25 million over-allotment option.   During 2015, we closed two collateralized securitization offerings, whereby we issued $486.8 million of investment grade notes and also entered into four new financing facilities for total availability of $278.5 million, of which, one facility for $87.0 million was repaid upon the repayment of a defaulted first mortgage note in the second quarter of 2015.  While there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the equity and debt markets, we will continue to pursue these and other available market opportunities as a means to increase our liquidity and capital base.  If we were to experience another prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets, it could cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. 
     
  As a result of the Acquisition, we are now a national originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) 2016 GSE Scorecard ( 2016 Scorecard ) established Fannie Mae s and Freddie Mac s loan origination caps at $31.0 billion each for market-rate apartments, ( 2016 Caps ), an increase of $1.0 billion each from the 2015 loan origination caps. Affordable housing loans, loans to small multifamily properties, and manufactured housing rental community loans continue to be excluded from the 2016 Caps. Additionally, the definition of the affordable loan exclusion continues to encompass affordable housing in high- and very-high cost markets and allows for an exclusion from the 2016 Caps for the pro-rata portion of any loan on a multifamily property that includes affordable units. The 2016 Scorecard provides FHFA the flexibility to review the estimated size of the multifamily loan origination market on a quarterly basis and proactively adjust the 2016 Caps upward should the market be larger than expected in 2016. In May 2016, the FHFA increased the 2016 Caps to $35.0 billion for each of the GSEs. The 2016 Scorecard also provides exclusions for loans to properties in underserved markets including rural, small multifamily and senior assisted living and for loans to finance energy or water efficiency improvements. The expanded liquidity should enable the GSEs to maintain their historical market share in a multifamily market that is projected by the Mortgage Bankers Association to be in excess of $225.0 billion in 2016. Our originations with the GSEs are highly profitable executions as they provide significant gains from the sale of our loans and non-cash gains related to mortgage servicing rights. A decline in our GSE originations would negatively impact our financial results as non-cash revenues would decrease disproportionately with loan origination volume and future servicing fee revenue would be constrained or decline. We do not know whether the FHFA will impose stricter limitations on GSE multifamily production volume beyond 2016.  
     
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Federal Reserve raised its targeted Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. To date we have not been significantly impacted by this increase and do not anticipate a significant decline in origination volume or profitability as a result of the increase as interest rates remain at historically low levels. However, we cannot be certain that such a trend will continue as the number, timing, and magnitude of additional increases by the Federal Reserve, combined with other macroeconomic factors, may have a different effect on the commercial real estate market.  
     
  The commercial real estate markets continue to improve, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets.  In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline again and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties.  Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan.  Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans as well as our ability to originate, sell and securitize loans, which would significantly impact our revenues, results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  
     
  The economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan and investment portfolio.  We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do  
     
 56   

Table of Contents   
     
  so.  In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms.  In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing.  However, since 2013, the levels of modifications and extensions have declined as borrowers  access to financing has improved.  If the markets were to deteriorate and another prolonged economic downturn was to occur, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.  
     
   Changes in Financial Condition   
     
   Assets   Comparison of balances at September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2015:   
     
  Cash and cash equivalents decreased $117.1 million primarily due to net cash consideration paid in connection with the Acquisition, funding new loan originations and investments, along with payment of distributions to our stockholders, partially offset by loan payoffs, transferring loans into our CLO vehicles, property sales and interest from our investments.  
     
  Restricted cash increased $126.3 million, excluding the restricted cash of $2.0 million from the Agency Business acquired, primarily due to payoffs and paydowns on our CLO loans being in excess of the transfer of loans into our CLO vehicles and issuance proceeds available from CLO VI. Restricted cash is kept on deposit with the trustees for our CLOs and primarily represents proceeds received from loan payoffs and paydowns that have not yet been disbursed to bondholders or redeployed into new assets, as well as unfunded loan commitments and interest payments received from loans. The restricted cash from the Agency Business acquired represents the cash collateral for possible losses resulting from the loans originated under the Fannie Mae DUS program in accordance with the terms of the loss-sharing agreements.  
     
  Our loan and investment portfolio balance from our Structured Business was $1.75 billion and $1.55 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The increase in the portfolio balance was primarily due to loan originations exceeding loan payoffs and other reductions by $236.5 million, see below for details.  
     
  Our portfolio had a weighted average current interest pay rate of 5.47% and 5.63% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Including certain fees and costs associated with the loan and investment portfolio, the weighted average current interest rate was 6.14% and 6.32% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Advances on our financing facilities totaled $1.42 billion and $1.18 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with a weighted average funding cost of 3.66% and 3.70%, respectively, which excludes changes in the market value of certain interest rate swaps and financing costs.  Including the financing costs, the weighted average funding rate was 4.09% and 4.12% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Loan and investment activity from our Structured Business was comprised of the following:  
     
 57   

Table of Contents   

Our loans held-for-sale, net from the Agency Business was $  310.3   million at September 30, 2016, which represents commercial mortgages originated through the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD programs. These loans are generally sold within 60 days from the loan origination date. Loan and investment activity from our Agency Business was comprised of the following: 

Our capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net from the Agency Business acquired was $224.3 million at September 30, 2016, which represents the estimated value of our rights to service mortgage loans for others. The weighted average estimated life remaining of our MSRs was approximately 6.3 years at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Investments in equity affiliates increased $11.1 million, primarily due to income of $8.5 million recognized from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business and an  additional contribution of $4.6 million made in o ur investment in non-qualified residential mortgages, which was partially offset by a $2.5 million cash distribution received from this investment. The distribution received was classified as a return of capital. 
     
   Our real estate owned assets (owned and held-for-sale) decreased $49.8 million, primarily from selling the three remaining multifamily properties with an aggregate carrying value of $28.6 million, selling a hotel property with a carrying value of $8.7 million, and recording an  $11.2 million impairment on a hotel property.  
     
   We recognized goodwill of $  27.8   million in connection with the Acquisition. We also recorded intangible assets totaling $73.3 million, of which $44.3 million represents finite-lived assets that will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets. 
     
   Other assets increased $  13.8   million, primarily from assets acquired in the Acquisition, including fixed assets totaling $5.0 million as of September 30, 2016.

Table of Contents   
     
   Liabilities   Comparison of balances at September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2015:   
     
  Credit facilities and repurchase agreements decreased $7.1 million, excluding the credit facilities of $301.9 million assumed in the Acquisition. The decrease was primarily due to paying down the facilities with a portion of the proceeds from CLO VI, substantially offset by funding of new loan activity.  The credit facilities held by our Agency Business are primarily used to fund loans that are originated through the GSE and HUD programs and are primarily secured by our loans held-for-sale, which are generally sold within 60 days from the loan origination date. 
     
  Collateralized loan obligations increased $248.8 million due to the completion of our sixth collateralized securitization in the third quarter of 2016 where we issued $250.3 million of CLO notes.  
     
  Mortgage note payable   real estate owned decreased $27.2 million, due to the pay-off of these notes with the proceeds from the sale of the remaining multifamily properties in the second quarter of 2016.  
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a $50.0 million preferred equity interest financing agreement with our Manager to finance a portion of the purchase price. See Note 12   Debt Obligations.  
     
  Due to related party increased $15.2 million, primarily due to  $11.4 million of cash owed to ACM in connection with an acquisition purchase price adjustment and $3.4 million of dividends owed to ACM from the OP Units issued in connection with the Acquisition. 
     
  Due to borrowers increased $16.2 million, due to an increase in unfunded commitments on loan originations.  
     
  We have allowance for loss-sharing obligations of $31.1 million assumed in connection with the Acquisition at September 30, 2016 to satisfy our obligation to partially guarantee the performance of the agency loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program. Generally, we are responsible for losses equal to the first 5% of the UPB and a portion of any additional losses to an overall maximum of 20% of the original principal balance.  
     
   Other liabilities increased $  32.4   million, primarily from the liabilities assumed with the Acquisition, which is comprised mostly of accrued compensation costs and a deferred tax liability. 
     
    Equity    
     
   Noncontrolling Interest   
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we issued 21,230,769 OP Units to satisfy a portion of the purchase price. The value of these OP units at the date of Acquisition was $154.8 million. Each of these OP Units are paired with one share of our Special Voting Preferred Shares having a par value of $0.01 per share and is entitled to one vote each on any matter submitted for stockholder approval.  
     
   Distributions   
     
  As of November 8, 2016, we have $413.8 million available under our shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the SEC in July 2016.

  The following table presents the average balance of interest-earning assets and related interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income and expense and the corresponding weighted average yields of our Structured Business (dollars in thousands):  

(1)            Based on UPB for loans, amortized cost for securities and principal amount of debt. 
  (2)            Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. 
     
   Net Interest Income   
     
  Interest income increased $0.9 million, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $2.7 million of interest income associated with the Agency Business acquired.  The increase was primarily due to a 12% increase in the average core interest-earning assets from $1.53 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.73 billion for the same period in 2016 due to new originations exceeding runoff. This increase  was partially offset by an 8% decrease in the average yield on core interest-earning assets from 6.68% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 6.15% for the same period in 2016 due to higher rates on payoffs when compared to originations in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the average LIBOR rate. Interest income of $2.7 million from the Agency Business reflects interest earned on our originated loans held-for-sale. 
     
  Interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 22%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $2.5 million of interest expense associated with the Agency Business acquired.  This increase was primarily the result of a 20% increase in our interest-bearing liabilities from $1.14 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.37 billion for the same period in 2016 due to increased leverage on our portfolio, as well as an increase in the average loan balance from portfolio growth. In addition, we experienced a 1% increase in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities from 4.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.19% for the same period in 2016, primarily due to a period-over-period increase in the average LIBOR rate.  Interest expense of $2.5 million from the Agency Business reflects interest expense associated with the financing of our loans held-for-sale. 
     
   Agency Business Revenue   
     
  See the Overview section at the beginning of this discussion  for details surrounding the Agency Business revenue we have as a result of the Acquisition.

Table of Contents   
     
  Fee-based services, including gain on sales, net was $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The agency loan sales for this period were $551.8 million and the fee-based services as a percentage of loan sales volume ( sales margin ) was 176 basis points.  
     
  Income from mortgage servicing rights was $16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The income from MSRs as a percentage of loan commitments volume ( MSR rate ) was 223 basis points.  
     
  Servicing revenue, net was $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was comprised of servicing revenue of $13.5 million, partially offset by amortization of MSRs of $7.6 million. The Agency Business servicing portfolio was $12.6 billion with a weighted average servicing fee of 48 basis points at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Other Revenue   
     
  Property operating results (income less expenses) are currently comprised of a hotel property and an office building.  Property operating results decreased $1.0 million, or 88%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to  the sale of several properties during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the addition of an office building in August 2015. 
     
   Other Expenses   
     
   Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $1.4 million, or 29%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $10.8 million of employee compensation and benefits expense associated with the Agency Business acquired.  The employees  directly related to the Agency Business (approximately 235) became our employees as of the Acquisition date.   The decrease was primarily due to $1.0 million of compensation related expenses recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to a distribution we received from an equity investment as well as compensation related costs now allocated to the Agency Business as a result of the Acquisition. 
     
  Selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $3.7 million of selling and administrative expenses associated with the Agency Business acquired. The $3.7 million of costs associated with the Agency Business are primarily comprised of professional fees (accounting, legal and consulting), rent, travel, marketing and other related costs.  
     
   Acquisition costs of $6.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represent costs incurred related to the Acquisition, which was completed in July 2016. See Note 3    Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform  for further details. 
     
  Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.6 million, or 49%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization associated with the Agency Business acquired. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of several real estate owned properties during 2015 and 2016. Agency Business depreciation and amortization is comprised of amortization on the finite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the Acquisition.  
     
  Provision for loss sharing was $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which represents our estimated total loss-sharing obligations needed to satisfy our partial guarantee for the performance of the Agency Business loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program in the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  Management fee   related party increased $0.6 million, or 22%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which was primarily due to compensation related costs incurred by employees of our Manager in connection with services they performed related to the Agency Business acquired.  
     
   Gain on Acceleration of Deferred Income / Loss on Termination of Swaps   
     
  In connection with the unwind of CDO III in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an $8.2 million gain that was previously deferred due to the reissuance CDO I, CDO II and CDO III bonds in 2010 as a result of a deferral of the gain from the extinguishment of trust preferred debt. See Note 12   Debt Obligations for more details about this

  gain. We also terminated the interest rate swap association with this CDO and recognized a loss of $0.3 million. See Note 14   Derivative Financial Instruments for more information about the swap termination.  
     
   Income from Equity Affiliates   
     
  Income from equity affiliates decreased $1.4 million, or 22%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $4.2 million reduction in distributions received from our Lexford equity investment, partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in income recognized from our residential mortgage banking investment.  In the third quarter of 2016, we recognized income of $3.9 million from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business and $0.7 million from a distribution received from our Lexford investment. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized income of $4.9 million from a distribution received from our Lexford investment and recognized income of $1.3 million from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business.  
     
   Provision for Income Taxes   
     
  The provision for income taxes was $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which primarily represents state and local taxes related to the Agency Business. We did not record a federal tax provision as we applied existing federal net operating losses to cover our federal tax requirements.  
     
   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest   
     
  The noncontrolling interest in the operating partnership relates to the 21,230,769 OP Units issued to satisfy a portion of the aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition, which represents approximately 29.2% of our outstanding stock at September 30, 2016. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at our option, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.

  (2)            Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. 
     
   Net Interest Income   
     
   Interest income increased $1.1 million, or 1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $2.7 million of interest income associated with the Agency Business acquired.  The impact of our  average core interest-earning assets increasing 4% from $1.60 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.67 billion for the  same period in 2016 was substantially offset by a 3% decrease in the average yield on core interest-earning assets from 6.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 6.38% for the same period in 2016. The decrease in the average yield on core interest-earning assets was primarily due to $4.0 million in interest income and fee income from accelerated runoff in 2015 and higher rates on payoffs when compared to originations in 2016, partially offset by $2.0 million of yield maintenance received on a loan payoff in the second quarter of 2016 and an increase in the average LIBOR rate. 
     
   Other interest income, net was $2.5 million and $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the first quarter of 2015, we acquired a $116.0 million defaulted first mortgage, at par, that paid off in the subsequent quarter. We initially  recognized net other interest income of $7.9 million at the time the loan paid off during the second quarter of 2015.  In April 2016, additional funds held in escrow from the note payoff were released following an arbitration proceeding and we recognized net other interest income totaling $2.5 million. 
     
  Interest expense increased $3.0 million, or 8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $2.5 million of interest expense associated with the Agency Business acquired.  The increase was primarily due to a 10% increase in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities from $1.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.28 billion for the same period in 2016 due to increased leverage on our portfolio, as well as an increase in the average loan balance from portfolio growth. This increase was partially offset by a 2% decrease in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities from 4.28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.21% for the same period in 2016, primarily due to the acceleration of $2.1

   Agency Business Revenue   
     
  Fee-based services, including gain on sales, net was $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The agency loan sales for this period were $551.8 million and the sales margin was 176 basis points.  
     
  Income from mortgage servicing rights was $16.0 million and the MSR rate was 223 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Servicing revenue, net was $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was comprised of servicing revenue of $13.5 million, partially offset by amortization of MSRs of $7.6 million. The Agency Business servicing portfolio was $12.6 billion with a weighted average servicing fee of 48 basis points at September 30, 2016.  
     
   Other Revenue   
     
  Property operating results decreased $2.7 million, or 61%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to  the sale of several properties during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the addition of an office building in August 2015. 
     
   Other Expenses   
     
   Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $2.0 million, or 14%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $10.8 million of employee compensation and benefits expense associated with the Agency Business acquired. The decrease was primarily  due to expenses totaling $2.2 million related to both the $116.0 million defaulted first mortgage that was repaid in the second quarter of 2015 and the Lexford distribution received in the third quarter of 2015.  
     
  Selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 12%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $3.7 million of selling and administrative expenses associated with the Agency Business acquired. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees.  
     
   Acquisition costs of $10.3 million and $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represent costs incurred related to the Acquisition, which was completed in July 2016.  See Note 3    Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform  for further details. 
     
  Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.2 million, or 53%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, excluding $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization associated with the Agency Business acquired. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of several real estate owned properties during 2015 and 2016.  
     
   Impairment loss on real estate owned was $11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  During the second quarter, we determined that our hotel property exhibited indicators of impairment and, as a result, we recorded an impairment loss of $11.2 million.  
     
  Provision for loss sharing was $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which represents our estimated total loss-sharing obligations needed to satisfy our partial guarantee for the performance of the Agency Business loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program in the third quarter of 2016.  
     
  Provision for loan losses (net of recoveries) totaled less than $0.1 million and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a $3.1 million provision for loan losses related to four loans and recorded net recoveries of previously recorded loan losses of $0.7 million.  
     
  Management fee   related party increased $0.8 million, or 10%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to compensation related costs incurred by employees of our Manager in connection with services they performed related to the Agency Business acquired.

   Gain on Acceleration of Deferred Income / Loss on Termination of Swaps   
     
  In connection with the unwind of CDO I and II in the first quarter of 2015 and CDO III in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a $19.2 million gain that was previously deferred due to the reissuance of CDO I, CDO II and CDO III bonds in 2010 as a result of a deferral of the gain from the extinguishment of trust preferred debt.  See Note 12   Debt Obligations for more details about this gain.  We also terminated the basis and interest rate swaps associated with these CDOs and recognized a loss of $4.6 million.  See Note 14   Derivative Financial Instruments for more details about the swap termination.  
     
   Gain on Sale of Real Estate   
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold the three remaining multifamily properties for $41.0 million and recognized a gain of $11.0 million, and sold a hotel property for $9.7 million and recognized a gain of $0.6 million.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we sold a multifamily property for $12.4 million and recognized a gain of $3.0 million, and sold a hotel property for $6.4 million and recognized a gain of $1.0 million.  
     
   Income from Equity Affiliates   
     
  Income from equity affiliates increased $0.2 million, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized income of $8.5 million from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business and $2.1 million from a distribution received from our Lexford equity investment. In the same period of 2015, we recognized income of $5.9 million from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business and received $4.9 million in distributions from our Lexford equity investment.  
     
   Provision for Income Taxes   
     
  The provision for income taxes was $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which primarily represents state and local taxes related to the Agency Business. We did not record a federal tax provision as we applied existing federal net operating losses to cover our federal tax requirements.  
     
   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest   
     
  The noncontrolling interest in the operating partnership relates to the 21,230,769 OP Units issued to satisfy a portion of the aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition, which represents approximately 29.2% of our outstanding stock at September 30, 2016. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at our option, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
    Sources of Liquidity    
     
  Liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements.  Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, satisfaction of collateral requirements under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing agreement and as an approved designated seller/servicer of Freddie Mac s SBL Program, operational liquidity requirements of the GSE agencies, funding future loans and investments, funding operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs.  Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity and debt offerings, debt facilities and cash flows from our operations.  Our equity sources, depending on market conditions, consist of proceeds from capital market transactions including the issuance of common, convertible and/or preferred equity securities.  Our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our CLOs, the issuance of convertible senior notes, the issuance of senior unsecured notes and junior subordinated notes and borrowings under warehousing facilities.  Net cash flows from operations include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest

Table of Contents   
     
  expense on our debt facilities, revenues from our Agency Business, cash generated from our real estate operations, cash from other investments reduced by expenses and repayments of outstanding loans and investments.  
     
   We believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for meeting our short-term and long-term liquidity needs.  A majority of our loans and investments are financed under existing  debt obligations  and their credit status is continuously monitored; therefore, these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return.  Our ability to meet our long-term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing.  Any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors, such as our financial performance, compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders  and investors  resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities. 
     
  While we have been successful in obtaining proceeds from debt and equity offerings, CLOs and certain financing facilities, current conditions in the capital and credit markets have and may continue to make certain forms of financing less attractive and, in certain cases, less available.  Therefore we will continue to rely, in part, on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital.  
     
  To maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.  These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations.  However, we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements.  
     
    Cash Flows    
     
  Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $149.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net cash inflows from held-for-sale loans of $122.0 million pertaining to our Agency Business, net income, adjusted for noncash gains, losses and expenses, of $21.0 million and cash distributions received from our investments in equity affiliates of $2.7 million.  
     
  Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $207.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Loan and investment activity (originations and payoffs/paydowns) comprise the bulk of our investing activities.  Loan originations from our Structured Business totaling $725.0 million, net of payoffs and paydowns of $531.9 million, resulted in a net cash outflow of $193.1 million.  Cash paid for the Acquisition was $68.4 million, net of cash acquired, and gross proceeds received from the sale of a hotel property and the three remaining multifamily properties were $49.0 million.  
     
  Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $58.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and consisted primarily of $1.81 billion in paydowns of our debt facilities, a $124.0 million increase in restricted cash balances, primarily from the payoff of loans in our CLO vehicles, a $27.2 million payoff of the mortgage note payable as a result of the sale of our three remaining multifamily properties and $29.2 million in distributions to our common and preferred stockholders, which was primarily offset by $1.68 billion of proceeds from the utilization of our debt facilities to fund new loan originations and $250.3 million of proceeds received from the issuance of CLO VI.  
     
    Agency Business Requirements    
     
  The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies.  Among other things, these agencies require the business to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements.  Our adjusted net worth and liquidity exceeded the agencies  requirements for all periods presented.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we were required to maintain at least $10.4 million of liquid assets to meet the operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae.  As of September 30, 2016, we had operational liquidity in excess of this requirement.  
     
 69   

Table of Contents   
     
  We are generally required to share the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program and we are required to secure this obligation by assigning restricted cash balances and/or a letter of credit to Fannie Mae.  The amount of collateral required by Fannie Mae is a formulaic calculation at the loan level and considers the balance of the loan, the risk level of the loan, the age of the loan, and the level of risk-sharing. Fannie Mae requires restricted liquidity for Tier 2 loans of 75 basis points, which is funded over a 48-month period that begins upon delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. As of September 30, 2016, we met the restricted liquidity requirement with a $35.0 million letter of credit and $2.0 million of cash collateral. Additionally, substantially all of the loans for which we have risk sharing, are Tier 2 loans.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, reserve requirements for the September 30, 2016 Fannie Mae DUS loan portfolio will require us to fund $21.0 million in additional restricted liquidity over the next 48 months, assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within our at risk portfolio. Fannie Mae periodically reassesses these collateral requirements and may make changes to these requirements in the future. We generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to meet these capital standards and do not expect any changes to have a material impact on our future operations; however, future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact our available cash.  
     
  We are subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that we have entered into with secondary market investors.  Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in our inability to originate and service loans for the respective investor and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on our combined financial statements.  As of September 30, 2016, we met all Fannie Mae capital amounts required for capital adequacy purposes, which are required on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2016, our Fannie Mae adjusted net worth was $169.2 million, as compared to the Fannie Mae required net worth of $55.4 million. We are not subject to capital requirements on a quarterly basis for GNMA or FHA, as such requirements for these investors are only required on an annual basis.  
     
  As an approved designated seller/servicer under Freddie Mac s SBL Program, we are required to post collateral to ensure that we are able to meet certain purchase and loss obligations required by this program. Under the SBL Program, we are required to post collateral equal to $5.0 million, which we utilize letters of credit to fund. At September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding letter of credit of $5.0 million in satisfaction of our requirements under this program.  
     
  We enter into contractual commitments with borrowers providing rate lock commitments while simultaneously entering into forward sale commitments with investors. These commitments are outstanding for short periods of time (generally less than 60 days) and are described in further detail in Note 14   Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16   Fair Value.  
     
    Debt Facilities    
     
  We maintain various forms of short-term and long-term financing arrangements.  Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans and investments.  The following is a summary of our debt facilities:  

(1) Principal balance excludes the impact of deferred financing costs.  
  (2) Maturity dates represent the weighted average maturity based on the underlying collateral as of September 30, 2016.  
  (3) Represents a total face amount of $175.9 million, including a total deferred amount of $15.0 million.

    Contractual Obligations    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had the following material contractual obligations (in thousands):  

(1)                  Represents principal amounts due based on contractual maturities. Does not include total projected interest payments on our debt obligations of $12.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, $46.7 million in 2017, $43.2 million in 2018, $34.6 million in 2019, $28.4 million in 2020, $16.9 million in 2021 and $79.1 million thereafter based on current LIBOR rates.  
     
  (2)                  Comprised of $281.3 million of CLO III debt, $219.0 million of CLO IV debt, $267.8 million of CLO V debt and $250.3 million of CLO VI debt with a weighted average contractual maturity of 2.09, 2.29, 2.40 and 4.03 years, respectively, as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  (3)                  Represents the face amount due upon maturity. The carrying value is $157.7 million, which is net of a deferred amount of $15.0 million and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million at September 30, 2016.  
     
  (4)                  Represents the total amount due at the end of the five-year term, including the scheduled increases to the principal balance if the debt remained outstanding until the end of the five-year term.  
     
  (5)                  In accordance with certain loans and investments, we have outstanding unfunded commitments of $32.3 million as of September 30, 2016, that we are obligated to fund as the borrowers meet certain requirements. Specific requirements include, but are not limited to, property renovations, building construction and building conversions based on criteria met by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreements. The payment due by period is based on the maturity date of underlying loans and is included in loans and investments, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Our restricted cash balance contained $1.9 million which was available to fund the portion of the unfunded commitments for loans financed by our CLO vehicles.  
     
  (6)                  Represents the operating lease payments due in connection with our lease of office space for our corporate headquarters and loan origination, support and servicing offices located throughout the U.S. Certain of the office leases have escalation clauses. The total rent expense was $0.9 million in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

    Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties    
     
  We have a management agreement with our Manager, pursuant to which our Manager provides certain services and we pay our Manager a base management fee and under certain circumstances, an annual incentive fee.  We incurred $3.3 million and $8.9 million of base management fee for services rendered in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $2.7 million and $8.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
  The base management fee is an arrangement whereby we reimburse our Manager for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties  agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true-ups to actual costs.  All origination fees on investments are retained by us.  
     
   In addition, we have conducted many transactions with our Manager and other parties that are deemed related party transactions. The details of the management agreement and related party transactions are described in Note 21    Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties of this report.  
     
  In June 2013, our Board of Directors formed a special committee consisting of independent directors in connection with the acquisition of our Manager s Agency Business, as well as the option to internalize the management of our current business. In February 2016, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and on July 14, 2016 we completed the Acquisition for $275.8 million. See Note 3   Acquisition of Our Manager s Agency Platform for further details.  
     
    Derivative  Financial Instruments   
     
   We enter into  derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business through the origination and sale of mortgage loans and the management of potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations of interest rates. See Note 14    Derivative Financial Instruments for further details surrounding our derivative financial instruments. 
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  Please refer to the section of our 2015 Annual Report entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies  for a discussion of our critical accounting policies. In connection with the Acquisition, we have adopted additional accounting policies as disclosed in  Note 2   Basis of Presentation, of which management believes the policies related to mortgage servicing rights, allowance for loss-sharing obligations and revenue recognition are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
     
   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   
     
    Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations    
     
  We present funds from operations ( FFO ) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ) because we believe they are important supplemental measures of our operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs.  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated real properties, plus impairments of depreciated properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.  
     
  We define AFFO as funds from operations adjusted for accounting items such as non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from MSRs, amortization of MSRs, changes in fair value of certain derivatives that temporarily flow through earnings as well as the add-back of one-time charges such as acquisition costs. We also add back impairment losses on real estate and gains/losses on sales of real estate. We are generally not in the business of operating real estate owned property and have obtained real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to our loans to maximize the value of the collateral and minimize our exposure.  Therefore, we deem such impairment and gains/losses on real estate as an extension of the asset management of our loans, thus a recovery of principal or additional loss on our initial investment.  
     
 72   

Table of Contents   
     
  FFO and AFFO are not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of funding our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.  Our calculation of FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  
     
  FFO and AFFO are as follows:  

(1) Amounts are attributable to common stockholders and OP Units holder. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at the Company s option for shares of the Company s common stock on a one-for-one basis.  
     
   Item 3.              Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
  We disclosed a quantitative and qualitative analysis regarding market risk in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2015 Annual Report.  That information is supplemented by the information included above in Item 2 of this report. Other than the developments described thereunder, there have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative exposure to market risk since December 31, 2015.  
     
  The following table projects the potential impact on interest income and interest expense for a 12-month period, and the potential change in fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2016, assuming an instantaneous increase or decrease of both 25 and 50 basis points in LIBOR and forward interest rate curves, adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities.  
     
 73   

Table of Contents   

(1)            Represents the UPB of our loan portfolio, principal balance of our debt and the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments, which includes interest rate swaps and LIBOR caps. 
     
  (2)            The quoted one-month LIBOR rate was 0.53% as of September 30, 2016. 
     
  In connection with the Acquisition, we  now originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD. Our loans held-for-sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD are not currently exposed to interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated prior to closing on the loan with the borrower, and the sale or placement is generally effectuated within 60 days of closing. The coupon rate for the loan is set after we established the interest rate with the investor. 
     
  The fair value of our MSRs is subject to market risk since a significant driver of the fair value of these assets is the discount rates. A 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate would decrease the fair value of our MSRs by approximately $7.1 million as of September 30, 2016, while a 100 basis point decrease would increase the fair value by approximately $7.5 million.  
     
   Item 4.              Controls and Procedures    
     
  Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at  September 30, 2016.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended  September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
     
   PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1.              Legal Proceedings    
     
  We are not involved in any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us other than the litigation described in Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies.   We have not made a loss accrual for this litigation because we believe that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount cannot be reasonably estimated. 
     
   Item 1A.  Risk Factors     
     
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, except that the information under the heading  Risk Factors  in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A we filed with the SEC on April 22, 2016 is hereby incorporated by reference and the below additional risk factor in connection with the goodwill recorded in connection with the Acquisition:  
     
 74   

Table of Contents   
     
    Our existing goodwill could become impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges.    
     
  We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. We also evaluate, at least quarterly, whether events or circumstances have occurred subsequent to the annual impairment testing which indicate that it is more-likely-than-not an impairment loss has occurred. If the fair value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, we would record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. The valuation of our reporting units requires significant judgment, which includes the evaluation of recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. Any impairment of goodwill as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our reported financial results for the period in which the charge was taken and our stock price.

  (a)                                    In connection with all calculations required to be made pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Scheduled Distributions on any Loan Obligation and Eligible Investment, or any payments on any other Assets, and with respect to the income that can be earned on Scheduled Distributions on any Loan Obligation or Eligible Investment and on any other amounts that may be received for credit to the applicable Collection Account, the provisions set forth in this  Section 1.2  shall be applied. 
     
  (b)                                    All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Loan Obligations and Eligible Investments shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each such Asset and upon report of payments, if any, received on such Asset that are furnished 
     
 41   

by or on behalf of the related borrower, obligor or issuer of such Asset and, to the extent they are not manifestly in error, such information or report may be conclusively relied upon in making such calculations.  
     
  (c)                                     For each Due Period, the Scheduled Distribution on any Loan Obligation (other than a Defaulted Obligation, which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) or Eligible Investment shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections in respect of such Loan Obligation or Eligible Investment (including all Sales Proceeds received during the Due Period and not reinvested in Replacement Loan Obligations or retained in the Principal Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment) that, if paid as scheduled, will be available in the Collection Accounts at the end of such Due Period for payment on the Notes and of expenses of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer pursuant to the Priority of Payments and (ii) any such amounts received in prior Due Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Payment Date and do not constitute amounts which have been used as reimbursement with respect to a prior Interest Advance pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. On any date of determination, the amount of any Scheduled Distribution due on any future date with respect to any Loan Obligation as to which any interest or other payment thereon is subject to withholding tax of any relevant jurisdiction shall be assumed to be made net of any such uncompensated withholding tax based upon withholding tax rates in effect on such date of determination. 
     
  (d)                                    For purposes of calculating the Par Value Ratio (1) an appraisal reduction of a Loan Obligation will be assumed to result in an implied reduction of Principal Balance for such Loan Obligation only if such appraisal reduction is intended to reduce the interest payable on such Loan Obligation and only in proportion to such interest reduction and (2) any Loan Obligation that has sustained an implied reduction of Principal Balance due to an appraisal reduction will not be considered a Defaulted Obligation solely due to such implied reduction. 
     
  (e)                                     For purposes of calculating the Interest Coverage Ratio, (1) the expected interest income on the Loan Obligations and Eligible Investments and the expected interest payable on the Notes shall be calculated using the interest rates applicable thereto on the applicable Measurement Date, (2) accrued original issue discount on Eligible Investments shall be deemed to be Scheduled Distributions due on the date such original issue discount is scheduled to be paid, (3) with respect to each Defaulted Obligation as to which the Loan Obligation Manager has delivered written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee of its intent to engage in either (x) Credit Risk/Defaulted Obligation Cash Purchase or (y) an exchange for an Exchange Obligation, the Loan Obligation Manager will have 45 days to exercise such purchase or exchange and during such period such Loan Obligation will not be treated as a Defaulted Obligation, (4) there will be excluded all scheduled or deferred payments of interest on or principal of Loan Obligations and any payment that the Loan Obligation Manager has determined in its reasonable judgment will not be made in cash or received when due and (5) with respect to any Loan Obligation as to which any interest or other payment thereon is subject to withholding tax of any relevant jurisdiction, each payment thereon shall be deemed to be payable net of such withholding tax unless the related borrower is required to make additional payments to fully compensate the Issuer for such withholding taxes (including in respect of any such additional payments). 
     
 42   

(f)                                      Each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Loan Obligation or Eligible Investment shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the applicable Collection Account except to the extent the Loan Obligation Manager has a reasonable expectation that such Scheduled Distribution will not be received on the applicable Due Date.  All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the applicable Collection Account for transfer to the Payment Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Notes or other amounts payable pursuant to this Indenture. 
     
  (g)                                     All calculations required to be made and all reports which are to be prepared pursuant to this Indenture with respect to the Assets, shall be made on the basis of the date on which the Issuer makes a binding commitment to purchase or sell a Loan Obligation or Eligible Investment rather than the date upon which such purchase or sale settles. 
     
  (h)                                    Any direction or Issuer Order required hereunder relating to the purchase, acquisition, sale, disposition or other transfer of Assets may be in the form of a trade ticket, confirmation of trade, instruction to post or to commit to the trade or similar instrument or document or other written instruction (including by email or other electronic communication or file transfer protocol) from the Loan Obligation Manager on which the Trustee may rely. 
     
  (i)                                        To the extent of any ambiguity in the interpretation of any definition or term contained in this Indenture or to the extent more than one methodology can be used to make any of the determinations or calculations set forth herein, the Loan Obligation Manager may direct the Collateral Administrator, or the Collateral Administrator may request direction from the Loan Obligation Manager, as to the interpretation and/or methodology to be used, in either case, and the Collateral Administrator shall follow such direction (if given), and together with the Trustee, shall be entitled to conclusively rely thereon without any responsibility or liability therefor. 
     
  Section 1.3                                        Interest Calculation Convention .

  (a)                                    The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is limited to U.S.$250,250,000, except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to  Section 2.5 ,  2.6  or  8.5  hereof.

  Section 2.4                                        Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating . 
     
  The Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer by an Authorized Officer of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, respectively.  The signature of such Authorized Officers on the Notes may be manual or facsimile.  
     
  Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the Authorized Officers of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer shall bind the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, as the case may be, notwithstanding the fact that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of issuance of such Notes.  
     
  At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer may deliver Notes executed by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for authentication and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent, upon Issuer Order (which Issuer Order shall, in connection with a transfer of Notes hereunder, be deemed to have been provided upon the delivery of an executed Note to the Trustee), shall authenticate and deliver such Notes as provided in this Indenture and not otherwise.

  (a)                                    The Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall cause to be kept a register (the   Notes Register  ) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes and the registration of transfers and exchanges of Notes.  The Trustee is hereby initially appointed  Notes Registrar  for the purpose of maintaining the Notes Registrar and registering Notes and transfers and exchanges of such Notes with respect to the Notes Register kept in the United States as herein provided.  Upon any resignation or removal of the Notes Registrar, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor or, in the absence of such appointment, assume the duties of Notes Registrar. 
     
  If a Person other than the Trustee is appointed by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer as Notes Registrar, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall give the Trustee prompt written notice of the appointment of a successor Notes Registrar and of the location, and any change in the location, of the Notes Register, and the Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Notes Register at all reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof and the Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Notes Registrar by an Officer thereof as to the names and addresses of the Holders of the Notes and the principal amounts and numbers of such Notes.

  At the option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for Notes of like terms, in any authorized denominations and of like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in  Section 7.2 .  Whenever any Note is surrendered for exchange, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Notes that the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.  
     
  All Notes issued and authenticated upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.  
     
 47   

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Notes Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.  
     
  No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.  
     
  None of the Notes Registrar, the Issuer or the Co-Issuer shall be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Notes to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption.  
     
  (b)                                    No Note may be sold or transferred (including, without limitation, by pledge or hypothecation) unless such sale or transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and is exempt from the registration requirements under applicable state securities laws. 
     
  (c)                                     No Note may be offered, sold, resold or delivered, within the United States or to, or for the benefit of, U.S. Persons except in accordance with  Section 2.5(e)  below and in accordance with Rule 144A to QIBs or, solely with respect to Definitive Notes, IAIs who are also Qualified Purchasers purchasing for their own account or for the accounts of one or more QIBs or IAIs who are also Qualified Purchasers, for which the purchaser is acting as fiduciary or agent.  The Notes may be offered, sold, resold or delivered, as the case may be, in offshore transactions to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S.  None of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee or any other Person may register the Notes under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. 
     
  (d)                                    Upon final payment due on the Stated Maturity Date of a Note, the Holder thereof shall present and surrender such Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at the office of the Paying Agent (outside the United States if then required by applicable law in the case of a Note in definitive form issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Security pursuant to  Section 2.10 ). 
     
  (e)                                      Transfers of Global Securities .  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Global Security remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Depository, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with  Section 2.2(c)  and this  Section 2.5(e) . 
     
  (i)                                        Except as otherwise set forth below, transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to nominees of the Depository or to a successor of the Depository or such successor s nominee.

If a holder of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Security wishes at any time to exchange its interest in such Regulation S Global Security for an interest in the corresponding Rule 144A Global Security or for a Definitive Note or to transfer its interest in such Regulation S Global Security to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the corresponding Rule 144A Global Security or for a Definitive Note, such holder may, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence and the rules and procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as the case may be, exchange or transfer, or cause the exchange or transfer of, such interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in the corresponding Rule 144A Global Security or for a Definitive Note.  Upon receipt by the Trustee or the Notes Registrar of:

  then the Notes Registrar shall either (x) if the transferee is taking a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Security, approve the instructions at DTC to reduce, or cause to be reduced, the Regulation S Global Security by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Security to be transferred or exchanged and the Notes Registrar shall instruct DTC, concurrently with such reduction, to credit or cause to be credited to the securities account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the corresponding Rule 144A Global Security equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Security or (y) if the transferee is taking an interest in a Definitive Note, the Notes Registrar shall record the transfer in the Notes Register in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)  and, upon execution by the Issuers, the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver one or more Definitive Notes, as applicable, registered in the names specified in the instructions described above, in principal amounts designated by the transferee (the aggregate of such principal amounts being equal to the aggregate principal amount of the interest in the Regulation S Global Security transferred by the transferor).

Upon receipt by the Trustee or the Notes Registrar of:  
     
  (1)                                    instructions given in accordance with DTC s procedures from an Agent Member directing the Trustee or the Notes Registrar to credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in the corresponding Regulation S Global Security, but not less than the minimum denomination applicable to such holder s Notes, in an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Security or Definitive Note to be exchanged or transferred, and in the case of a transfer of Definitive Notes, such Holder s Definitive Notes properly endorsed for assignment to the transferee,

of (A) a duly complete certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit D-3  and (B) appropriate instructions from DTC, if required, the Trustee or the Notes Registrar shall approve the instructions at DTC to reduce, or cause to be reduced, the Rule 144A Global Security by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Security to be transferred or exchanged, record the transfer in the Register in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)  and upon execution by the Issuers authenticate and deliver one or more Definitive Notes, registered in the names specified in the instructions described in clause (B) above, in principal amounts designated by the transferee (the aggregate of such principal amounts being equal to the aggregate principal amount of the interest in the Rule 144A Global Security transferred by the transferor).  
     
  (v)                                     Transfer of Definitive Notes to Rule 144A Global Securities .  If a holder of a Definitive Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in such Definitive Note for a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Security or to transfer such Definitive Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Security, such holder may, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence and the rules and procedures of DTC, exchange or transfer, or cause the exchange or transfer of, such Definitive Note for beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Security ( provided  that no IAI may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Security).  Upon receipt by the Trustee or the Notes Registrar of (A) a Holder s Definitive Note properly endorsed for assignment to the transferee; (B) a duly completed certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit D-2  attached hereto; (C) instructions given in accordance with DTC s procedures from an Agent Member to instruct DTC to cause to be credited a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Securities in an amount equal to the Definitive Notes to be transferred or exchanged; and (D) a written order given in accordance with DTC s procedures containing information regarding the participant s account of DTC to be credited with such increase, the Trustee or the Notes Registrar shall cancel such Definitive Note in accordance herewith, record the transfer in the Notes Register in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)  and approve the instructions at DTC, concurrently with such cancellation, to credit or cause to be credited to the securities account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the corresponding Rule 144A Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Note transferred or exchanged. 
     
  (vi)                                  Other Exchanges .  In the event that, pursuant to  Section 2.10  hereof, a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Notes, such Notes may be exchanged for one another only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions above (including certification requirements intended to ensure that such transfers are to a QIB who is also a Qualified Purchaser or are to a non-U.S. Person, or otherwise comply with Rule 144A or Regulation S, as the case may be) and as may be from time to time adopted by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Trustee. 
     
  (f)                                       Removal of Legend .  If Notes are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Notes bearing the applicable legends set forth in  Exhibits A  and  B  hereto, and if a request is made to remove such applicable legend on such Notes, the Notes so issued shall bear such applicable legend, or such applicable legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Co-Issuer such satisfactory evidence, which may 
     
 51   

include an Opinion of Counsel of an attorney at law licensed to practice law in the State of New York (and addressed to the Issuer and the Trustee), as may be reasonably required by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, to the effect that neither such applicable legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144A or Regulation S, as applicable, the 1940 Act or ERISA.  So long as the Issuer or the Co-Issuer is relying on an exemption under or promulgated pursuant to the 1940 Act, the Issuer or the Co-Issuer shall not remove that portion of the legend required to maintain an exemption under or promulgated pursuant to the 1940 Act.  Upon provision of such satisfactory evidence, as confirmed in writing by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, to the Trustee, the Trustee, at the direction of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, shall authenticate and deliver Notes that do not bear such applicable legend.  
     
  (g)                                     Each beneficial owner of Regulation S Global Securities shall be deemed to make the representations and agreements set forth in  Exhibit D-1  hereto. 
     
  (h)                                    Each beneficial owner of Rule 144A Global Securities shall be deemed to make the representations and agreements set forth in  Exhibit D-2  hereto. 
     
  (i)                                        Each Holder of Definitive Notes shall make the representations and agreements set forth in the certificate attached as  Exhibit D-3  hereto. 
     
  (j)                                       Any purported transfer of a Note not in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)  shall be null and void and shall not be given effect for any purpose hereunder. 
     
  (k)                                    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture to the contrary, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Registrar (nor any other Transfer Agent) shall be responsible or liable for compliance with applicable federal or state securities laws (including, without limitation, the Securities Act or Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated thereunder), the 1940 Act, ERISA or the Code (or any applicable regulations thereunder);  provided  ,   however , that if a specified transfer certificate or Opinion of Counsel is required by the express terms of this  Section 2.5  to be delivered to the Trustee or Notes Registrar prior to registration of transfer of a Note, the Trustee and/or Notes Registrar, as applicable, is required to request, as a condition for registering the transfer of the Note, such certificate or Opinion of Counsel and to examine the same to determine whether it conforms on its face to the requirements hereof (and the Trustee or Notes Registrar, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the party delivering the same if it determines that such certificate or Opinion of Counsel does not so conform). 
     
  (l)                                        If the Trustee determines or is notified by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Loan Obligation Manager that (i) a transfer or attempted or purported transfer of any interest in any Note was consummated in compliance with the provisions of this  Section 2.5  on the basis of a materially incorrect certification from the transferee or purported transferee, (ii) a transferee failed to deliver to the Trustee any certification required to be delivered hereunder or (iii) the holder of any interest in a Note is in breach of any representation or agreement set forth in any certification or any deemed representation or agreement of such holder, the Trustee shall not register such attempted or purported transfer and if a transfer has been registered, such transfer shall be absolutely null and void  ab initio  and shall vest no rights in the purported transferee (such purported transferee, a   Disqualified Transferee  ) and the last preceding holder of such 
     
 52   

interest in such Note that was not a Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights as a Holder thereof retroactively to the date of transfer of such Note by such Holder.  
     
  In addition, the Trustee may require that the interest in the Note referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) in the preceding paragraph be transferred to any person designated by the Issuer or the Loan Obligation Manager at a price determined by the Issuer or the Loan Obligation Manager, as applicable, based upon its estimation of the prevailing price of such interest and each Holder, by acceptance of an interest in a Note, authorizes the Trustee to take such action.  In any case, none of the Issuer, the Trustee nor the Loan Obligation Manager shall be held responsible for any losses that may be incurred as a result of any required transfer under this  Section 2.5(l) .  
     
  (m)                                Each Holder of Notes approves and consents to (i) the initial purchase of the Loan Obligations by the Issuer from Affiliates of the Loan Obligation Manager on the Closing Date and (ii) any other transaction between the Issuer and the Loan Obligation Manager or its Affiliates that are permitted under the terms of this Indenture or the Loan Obligation Management Agreement. 
     
  (n)                                    As long as any Note is Outstanding, Notes held by Issuer Parent or an Issuer Parent Disregarded Entity may not be transferred (whether by means of actual transfer or transfer of beneficial ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes), pledged or hypothecated to any other Person (except to Issuer Parent or an Issuer Parent Disregarded Entity) unless the Issuer receives an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham   Taft LLP or another nationally recognized tax counsel experienced in such matters that such transfer will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States for federal income tax purposes or to otherwise become subject to federal income tax on a net income basis (or has previously received an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham   Taft LLP or another nationally recognized tax counsel experienced in such matters that the Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation that is not engaged in a trade or business in the United States for federal income tax purposes). 
     
  Section 2.6                                        Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Note . 
     
  If (a) any mutilated or defaced Note is surrendered to a Transfer Agent, or if there shall be delivered to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Transfer Agent (each a   Specified Person  ) evidence to their reasonable satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and (b) there is delivered to the Specified Person such security or indemnity as may be required by each Specified Person to save each of them and any agent of any of them harmless (an unsecured indemnity agreement delivered to the Trustee by an institutional investor with a net worth of at least U.S.$200,000,000 being deemed sufficient to satisfy such security or indemnity requirement), then, in the absence of notice to the Specified Persons that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall execute and, upon Issuer Request, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note, of like tenor (including the same date of issuance) and equal principal amount, registered in the same manner, dated the date of its authentication, bearing interest from the date to which interest has been paid on the mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Note and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.  
     
 53   

If, after delivery of such new Note, a bona fide purchaser of the predecessor Note presents for payment, transfer or exchange such predecessor Note, any Specified Person shall be entitled to recover such new Note from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking therefrom, and each Specified Person shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by such Specified Person in connection therewith.  
     
  In case any such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become due and payable, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note without requiring surrender thereof except that any mutilated or defaced Note shall be surrendered.  
     
  Upon the issuance of any new Note under this  Section 2.6 , the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, may require the payment by the registered Holder thereof of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.  
     
  Every new Note issued pursuant to this  Section 2.6  in lieu of any mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if applicable, and such new Note shall be entitled, subject to the second paragraph of this  Section 2.6 , to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.  
     
  The provisions of this  Section 2.6  are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.  
     
  Section 2.7                                        Payment of Principal and Interest and Other Amounts; Principal and Interest Rights Preserved . 
     
  (a)                                    The Class A Notes shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period at the Class A Rate.  Interest on each Class A Note shall be due and payable on each Payment Date immediately following the related Interest Accrual Period in the proportion that the outstanding principal amount of such Class A Note bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Class A Notes;  provided ,  however , that the payment of interest on the Class A Notes is subordinated to the payment on each Payment Date of certain amounts in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
     
  (b)                                    The Class B Notes shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period at the Class B Rate.  Interest on each Class B Note shall be due and payable on each Payment Date immediately following the related Interest Accrual Period in the proportion that the outstanding principal amount of such Class B Note bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Class B Notes;  provided ,  however , that the payment of interest on the Class B Notes is subordinated to the payment on each Payment Date of the interest due and payable on the Class A Notes (including any Class A Defaulted Interest Amount) and certain other amounts in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
     
 54   

(c)                                     The Class C Notes shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period at the Class C Rate.  Interest on each Class C Note shall be due and payable on each Payment Date immediately following the related Interest Accrual Period in the proportion that the outstanding principal amount of such Class C Note bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Class C Notes;  provided ,  however , that the payment of interest on the Class C Notes is subordinated to the payment on each Payment Date of the interest due and payable on the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes (including any Class A Defaulted Interest Amount and any Class B Defaulted Interest Amount) and certain other amounts in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
     
  (d)                                    Upon any Optional Redemption, Tax Redemption or Clean-up Call, all net proceeds remaining after the sale of the Loan Obligations in accordance with  Article 12  hereof and Cash and proceeds from Eligible Investments (other than the Issuer s right, title and interest in the property described in clause (i) of the definition of  Excepted Assets ), after the payment of the amounts referred to in clauses (1) through (10) of  Section 11.1(a)(i)  and clauses (1) through (7) of  Section 11.1(a)(ii)  will be distributed by the Trustee to the Preferred Shares Paying Agent for distribution to the Holders of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the Preferred Share Paying Agency Agreement, whereupon the Preferred Shares will be cancelled and deemed paid in full for all purposes. 
     
  (e)                                     Interest shall cease to accrue on each Class of Notes, or in the case of a partial repayment, on such part, from the date of repayment or the Stated Maturity Date, whichever occurs first, unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or unless a Default has occurred with respect to such payments of principal. 
     
  (f)                                      The principal of each Class of Notes matures at par and is due and payable on the Stated Maturity Date, unless such principal has been previously repaid or unless the unpaid principal of such Class of Notes becomes due and payable at an earlier date by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise;  provided ,  however , that the payment of principal on the Class B Notes (other than payment of principal pursuant to  Section 9.5 ) may only occur after the principal on the Class A Notes has been paid in full and is subordinated to the payment on each Payment Date of the principal and interest due and payable on the Class A Notes and other amounts in accordance with the Priority of Payments and any payment of principal on the Class B Notes which is not paid, in accordance with the Priority of Payments, on any Payment Date, shall not be considered  due and payable  solely for purposes of  Section 5.1(b)  until the Payment Date on which such principal may be paid in accordance with the Priority of Payments or all of the Class A Notes have been paid in full;  provided ,  further , that the payment of principal on the Class C Notes (other than payment of principal pursuant to  Section 9.5 ) may only occur after the principal on the Class B Notes has been paid in full and is subordinated to the payment on each Payment Date of the principal and interest due and payable on the Class B Notes and other amounts in accordance with the Priority of Payments and any payment of principal on the Class C Notes which is not paid, in accordance with the Priority of Payments, on any Payment Date, shall not be considered  due and payable  solely for purposes of  Section 5.1(b)  until the Payment Date on which such principal may be paid in accordance with the Priority of Payments or all of the Class B Notes have been paid in full.  Payments of principal on the Notes in connection with a Clean-up Call, Tax Redemption or Optional Redemption will be made in accordance with  Section 9.1  and the Priority of Payments. 
     
 55   

(g)                                     As a condition to the payment of principal of and interest on any Note without the imposition of U.S. withholding tax, the Issuer shall require certification acceptable to it to enable the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee, the Preferred Shares Paying Agent and the Paying Agent to determine their duties and liabilities with respect to any taxes or other charges that they may be required to deduct or withhold from payments in respect of such Security under any present or future law or regulation of the United States or any present or future law or regulation of any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein or to comply with any reporting or other requirements under any such law or regulation.  Such certification may include U.S. federal income tax forms (such as IRS Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals)), IRS Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting), IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification), or IRS Form W-8ECI (Certificate of Foreign Person s Claim that Income is Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States)) or any successors to such IRS forms.  In addition, each of the Issuer, Co-Issuer, the Trustee, Preferred Shares Paying Agent or any Paying Agent may require certification acceptable to it to enable the Issuer to qualify for a reduced rate of withholding in any jurisdiction from or through which the Issuer receives payments on its assets.  Each Holder and each beneficial owner of Notes agree to provide any certification requested pursuant to this  Section 2.7(g)  and to update or replace such form or certification in accordance with its terms or its subsequent amendments.  Furthermore, (i) if a Holder is a  foreign financial institution  or other foreign financial entity subject to FATCA or (ii) if the Issuer is no longer a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or other disregarded entity of a REIT, but is instead a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer shall require information to comply with FATCA requirements pursuant to clause (xii) of the representations and warranties set forth under the third paragraph of  Exhibit D-1  hereto, as deemed made pursuant to  Section 2.5(g)  hereto, or pursuant to clause (xiii) of the representations and warranties set forth under the third paragraph of  Exhibit D-2  hereto, as deemed made pursuant to  Section 2.5(h)  hereto, or pursuant to clause (xi) of the representations and warranties set forth under the third paragraph of  Exhibit D-3  hereto, made pursuant to  Section 2.5(i)  hereto, as applicable.  In the event a Holder fails to provide such information, or to the extent the Holder s ownership of Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to any tax under FATCA, (A) the Issuer is authorized to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder as compensation for any tax imposed under FATCA as a result of such failure or the Holder s ownership, and (B) to the extent necessary to avoid an adverse effect on the Issuer as a result of such failure or the Holder s ownership, the Issuer will have the right to compel the Holder to sell its Notes, and, if the Holder does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice from the Issuer, to sell such Notes at a public or private sale called and conducted in any manner permitted by law, and to remit the net proceeds of such sale (taking into account any taxes incurred by the Issuer in connection with such sale) to the Holder as payment in full for such Notes.  The Issuer may also assign each such Note a separate CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers in the Issuer s sole discretion. 
     
  (h)                                    Payments in respect of interest on and principal of the Notes shall be payable by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a Dollar account maintained by the Holder or its nominee;  provided  that the Holder has provided wiring instructions to the Trustee 
     
 56   

on or before the related Record Date or, if wire transfer cannot be effected, by a Dollar check drawn on a bank in the United States, or by a Dollar check mailed to the Holder at its address in the Notes Register.  The Issuer expects that the Depository or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of a Global Security held by the Depository or its nominee, shall immediately credit the applicable Agent Members  accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to the respective beneficial interests in such Global Security as shown on the records of the Depository or its nominee.  The Issuer also expects that payments by Agent Members to owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security held through Agent Members will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers.  Such payments will be the responsibility of the Agent Members.  Upon final payment due on the Maturity of a Note, the Holder thereof shall present and surrender such Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at the office of the Paying Agent (outside of the United States if then required by applicable law in the case of a Definitive Note issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Security) on or prior to such Maturity.  None of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability with respect to any records maintained by the Holder of any Note with respect to the beneficial holders thereof or payments made thereby on account of beneficial interests held therein.  In the case where any final payment of principal and interest is to be made on any Note (other than on the Stated Maturity Date thereof) the Issuer or, upon Issuer Request, the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall not more than 30 nor fewer than five Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is to be made, mail to the Persons entitled thereto at their addresses appearing on the Notes Register, a notice which shall state the date on which such payment will be made and the amount of such payment and shall specify the place where such Notes may be presented and surrendered for such payment.  
     
  (i)                                        Subject to the provisions of  Sections 2.7(a)  through  (h)  and  Section 2.7(l)  hereof, Holders of Notes as of the Record Date in respect of a Payment Date shall be entitled to the interest accrued and payable in accordance with the Priority of Payments and principal payable in accordance with the Priority of Payments on such Payment Date.  All such payments that are mailed or wired and returned to the Paying Agent shall be held for payment as herein provided at the office or agency of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer to be maintained as provided in  Section 7.2  (or returned to the Trustee). 
     
  (j)                                       Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest. 
     
  (k)                                    Payments of principal to Holders of the Notes of each Class shall be made in the proportion that the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Notes of such Class registered in the name of each such Holder on such Record Date bears to the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Notes of such Class on such Record Date. 
     
  (l)                                        Interest accrued with respect to the Notes shall be calculated as described in the applicable form of Note attached hereto. 
     
 57   

(m)                                All reductions in the principal amount of a Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) effected by payments of installments of principal made on any Payment Date, Redemption Date or upon Maturity shall be binding upon all future Holders of such Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such Note. 
     
  (n)                                    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture to the contrary, the obligations of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer under the Notes, this Indenture and the other Transaction Documents are limited-recourse obligations of the Issuer and non-recourse obligations of the Co-Issuer payable solely from the Assets and following realization of the Assets, all obligations of the Co-Issuers and any claims of the Noteholders, the Trustee or any other parties to any Transaction Documents shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive.  No recourse shall be had for the payment of any amount owing in respect of the Notes against any Officer, director, employee, shareholder, limited partner or incorporator of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any of their respective successors or assigns for any amounts payable under the Notes or this Indenture.  It is understood that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not (i) prevent recourse to the Assets for the sums due or to become due under any security, instrument or agreement which is part of the Assets or (ii) constitute a waiver, release or discharge of any indebtedness or obligation evidenced by the Notes or secured by this Indenture (to the extent it relates to the obligation to make payments on the Notes) until such Assets have been realized, whereupon any outstanding indebtedness or obligation in respect of the Notes, this Indenture and the other Transaction Documents shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive.  It is further understood that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not limit the right of any Person to name the Issuer or the Co-Issuer as a party defendant in any Proceeding or in the exercise of any other remedy under the Notes or this Indenture, so long as no judgment in the nature of a deficiency judgment or seeking personal liability shall be asked for or (if obtained) enforced against any such Person or entity. 
     
  (o)                                    Subject to the foregoing provisions of this  Section 2.7 , each Note delivered under this Indenture and upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights of unpaid interest and principal that were carried by such other Note. 
     
  (p)                                    Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions with respect to payments of principal of and interest on the Notes (but subject to  Sections 2.7(f)  and  (l) ), if the Notes have become or been declared due and payable following an Event of Default and such acceleration of Maturity and its consequences have not been rescinded and annulled and the provisions of  Section 5.5  are not applicable, then payments of principal of and interest on such Notes shall be made in accordance with  Section 5.7  hereof. 
     
  (q)                                    Payments in respect of the Preferred Shares as contemplated by  Sections 11.1(a)(i)(12)  and  11.1(a)(ii)(8)  shall be made by the Trustee to the Preferred Shares Paying Agent. 
     
 58   

Section 2.8                                        Persons Deemed Owners . 
     
  The Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee, and any agent of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee may treat as the owner of a Note the Person in whose name such Note is registered on the Notes Register on the applicable Record Date for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and interest and other amounts on such Note and on any other date for all other purposes whatsoever (whether or not such Note is overdue), and none of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary;  provided  ,   however , that the Depository, or its nominee, shall be deemed the owner of the Global Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in Global Securities will not be considered the owners of any Notes for the purpose of receiving notices.  With respect to the Preferred Shares, on any Payment Date, the Trustee shall deliver to the Preferred Shares Paying Agent the distributions thereon for distribution to the Preferred Shareholders.  
     
  Section 2.9                                        Cancellation .

  (ii)                                     if a holder of a Definitive Note wishes at any time to exchange such Definitive Note for one or more Definitive Notes or transfer such Definitive Note to a transferee who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a Definitive Note in accordance with  Section 2.10 , such holder may effect such exchange or transfer upon receipt by the Trustee or the Notes Registrar of (A) a Holder s Definitive Note properly endorsed for assignment to the transferee, and (B) duly completed certificates in the form of  Exhibit D-3 , upon receipt of which the Trustee or the Notes Registrar shall then cancel such Definitive Note in accordance herewith, record the transfer in the Notes Register in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)  and upon execution by the Co-Issuers authenticate and deliver one or more Definitive Notes bearing the same designation as the Definitive Note endorsed for transfer, registered in the names specified in the assignment described in clause (A) above, in principal amounts designated by the transferee (the aggregate of 
     
 59   

such principal amounts being equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Note surrendered by the transferor);  
     
  (iii)                                  in the event that the Depository notifies the Issuer and the Co-Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for a Global Security or if at any time such Depository ceases to be a  Clearing Agency  registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days of such notice, the Global Securities deposited with the Depository pursuant to  Section 2.2  hereof shall be transferred to the beneficial owners thereof subject to the procedures and conditions set forth in this  Section 2.10 . 
     
  (b)                                    Any Global Security that is exchanged for a Definitive Note shall be surrendered by the Depository to the Trustee s Corporate Trust Office together with necessary instruction for the registration and delivery of a Definitive Note to the beneficial owners (or such owner s nominee) holding the ownership interests in such Global Security.  Any such transfer shall be made, without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon such transfer of each portion of such Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Notes of the same Class and authorized denominations.  Any Definitive Notes delivered in exchange for an interest in a Global Security shall, except as otherwise provided by  Section 2.5(f) , bear the applicable legend set forth in  Exhibits C-1  or  C-2 , as applicable, and shall be subject to the transfer restrictions referred to in such applicable legend.

  (c)                                     Subject to the provisions of  Section 2.10(b)  above, the registered Holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Notes. 
     
  (d)                                    In the event of the occurrence of either of the events specified in  Section 2.10(a)  above, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Notes. 
     
  Pending the preparation of Definitive Notes pursuant to this  Section 2.10 , the Issuer and the Co-Issuer may execute and, upon Issuer Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Class A Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise reproduced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Officers executing such Definitive Notes may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Definitive Notes.  
     
  If temporary Definitive Notes are issued, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall cause permanent Definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable delay.  The Definitive Notes shall be printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, or provided by any combination thereof, or in any other manner permitted by the rules and regulations of any applicable notes exchange, all as determined by the Officers executing such Definitive Notes.  
     
 60   

After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the applicable temporary Class A Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes at the office or agency maintained by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer for such purpose, without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Class A Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange therefor the same aggregate principal amount of Definitive Notes of authorized denominations.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Class A Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Notes.  
     
  Section 2.11                                 U.S. Tax Treatment of Notes and the Issuer . 
     
  (a)                                    Each of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer intends that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Notes (unless held by Issuer Parent or an Issuer Parent Disregarded Entity) be treated as debt and that the Issuer be treated as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary (unless the Issuer has received an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham   Taft LLP or another nationally recognized tax counsel experienced in such matters opining that the Issuer will be treated as a foreign corporation not engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis).  Each prospective purchaser and any subsequent transferee of a Note or any interest therein shall, by virtue of its purchase or other acquisition of such Note or interest therein, be deemed to have agreed to treat such Note in a manner consistent with the preceding sentence for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
     
  (b)                                    The Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall account for the Notes and prepare any reports to Noteholders and tax authorities consistent with the intentions expressed in  Section 2.11(a)  above. 
     
  (c)                                     Each Holder of Notes shall timely furnish to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or its agents any U.S. federal income tax form or certification (such as IRS Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals)), IRS Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting), IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification), or IRS Form W-8ECI (Certificate of Foreign Person s Claim that Income is Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States)) or any successors to such IRS forms that the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or its agents may reasonably request and shall update or replace such forms or certification in accordance with its terms or its subsequent amendments.  Furthermore, if the Issuer is no longer treated as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or other disregarded entity of a REIT but is instead a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if a Noteholder is a  foreign financial institution  or other foreign financial entity subject to FATCA, Noteholders shall timely furnish any information required pursuant to  Section 2.7(g) . 
     
 61   

Section 2.12                                 Authenticating Agents . 
     
  Upon the request of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, the Trustee shall, and if the Trustee so chooses the Trustee may, pursuant to this Indenture, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act on its behalf and subject to its direction in the authentication of Notes in connection with issuance, transfers and exchanges under  Sections 2.4, 2.5 ,  2.6  and  8.5  hereof, as fully to all intents and purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by such Sections to authenticate such Notes.  For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication of Notes by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this  Section 2.12  shall be deemed to be the authentication of Notes by the Trustee.  
     
  Any corporation or banking association into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or banking association resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the execution or filing of any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.  Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer.  The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation or upon such a termination, the Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written notice of such appointment to the Issuer.  
     
  The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent appointed by it from time to time reasonable compensation for its services, and reimbursement for its reasonable expenses relating thereto and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to  Section 6.7  hereof.  The provisions of  Sections 2.9 ,  6.4  and  6.5  hereof shall be applicable to any Authenticating Agent.  
     
  Section 2.13                                 Forced Sale on Failure to Comply with Restrictions . 
     
  (a)                                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Indenture, any transfer of a Note or interest therein to a U.S. Person who is determined not to have been both a QIB and a Qualified Purchaser at the time of acquisition of the Note or interest therein shall be null and void and any such proposed transfer of which the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee shall have notice may be disregarded by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and the Trustee for all purposes. 
     
  (b)                                    If the Issuer determines that any Holder of a Note has not satisfied the applicable requirement described in  Section 2.13(a)  above (any such person a   Non-Permitted Holder  ), then the Issuer shall promptly after discovery that such Person is a Non-Permitted Holder by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee (and notice by the Trustee or the Co-Issuer to the Issuer, if either of them makes the discovery), send notice (or procure that notice is sent) to such Non-Permitted Holder demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder transfer its interest to a Person that is not a Non-Permitted Holder within 30 days of the date of such notice.  If such Non-Permitted Holder fails to so transfer its Note or interest therein, the Issuer shall have the 
     
 62   

right, without further notice to the Non-Permitted Holder, to sell such Note or interest therein to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted Holder on such terms as the Issuer may choose.  The Issuer, or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Issuer, may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Note, and selling such Note to the highest such bidder.  However, the Issuer or the Trustee may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole discretion.  The Holder of such Note, the Non-Permitted Holder and each other Person in the chain of title from the Holder to the Non-Permitted Holder, by its acceptance of an interest in the Note, agrees to cooperate with the Issuer and the Trustee to effect such transfers.  The proceeds of such sale, net of any commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the Non-Permitted Holder.  The terms and conditions of any sale under this  Section 2.13(b)  shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall not be liable to any Person having an interest in the Note sold as a result of any such sale of exercise of such discretion.  
     
  Section 2.14                                 No Gross Up . 
     
  The Issuer shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to the Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes as a result of any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges.

  (i)                                        the Issuer or the Co-Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: 
     
  (A)                  all unpaid installments of interest on and principal on the Notes that would be due and payable hereunder if the Event of Default giving rise to such acceleration had not occurred;

  (ii)                                     the Trustee has determined that all Events of Default of which it has actual knowledge, other than the non-payment of the interest and principal on the Notes that have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured and a Majority of the Controlling Class, by written notice to the Trustee, has agreed with such determination (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or waived as provided in  Section 5.14 . 
     
  At any such time that the Trustee, subject to  Section 5.2(b) , shall rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences as permitted hereinabove, the Trustee shall preserve the Assets in accordance with the provisions of  Section 5.5  with respect to the Event of Default that gave rise to such declaration;  provided ,  however , that if such preservation of the Assets is rescinded pursuant to  Section 5.5 , the Notes may be accelerated pursuant to the first paragraph of this  Section 5.2 , notwithstanding any previous rescission and annulment of a declaration of acceleration pursuant to this paragraph.  
     
  No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.  
     
  (c)                                     Subject to  Sections 5.4  and  5.5 , a Majority of the Controlling Class shall have the right to direct the Trustee in the conduct of any Proceedings for any remedy available to the Trustee or in the sale of any or all of the Assets;  provided  that (i) such direction will not conflict with any rule of law or this Indenture; (ii) the Trustee may take any other action not inconsistent with such direction; (iii) the Trustee determines that such action will not subject it to liability (unless the Trustee has received satisfactory indemnity or reasonable security against any such liability); and (iv) any direction to undertake a sale of the Assets may be made only as described in  Section 5.17 . 
     
  (d)                                    As security for the payment by the Issuer of the compensation and expenses of the Trustee and any sums the Trustee may be entitled to receive as indemnification by the Issuer, the Issuer hereby grants the Trustee a lien on the Assets, which lien is senior to the lien of the Noteholders.  The Trustee s lien shall be subject to the Priority of Payments and exercisable by the Trustee only if the Notes have been declared due and payable following an Event of Default and such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled. 
     
  (e)                                     A Majority of the Aggregate Outstanding Amount of Notes of the Controlling Class, may, prior to the time a judgment or decree for the payment of amounts due has been obtained by the Trustee, waive any past Default on behalf of the holders of all the Notes and its consequences in accordance with  Section 5.14 .

  If the Issuer or the Co-Issuer fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as Trustee of an express trust, may institute a Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Issuer and the Co-Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the amounts adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the Assets.  
     
  If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee shall proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Noteholders by such Proceedings (x) as directed by a Majority of the Controlling Class or (y) in the absence of direction by a Majority of the Controlling Class, as deemed most effectual by the Trustee;  provided , that (a) such direction must not conflict with any rule of law or with any express provision of this Indenture, (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction, (c) the Trustee has been provided with security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, any direction to the Trustee to undertake a sale of Assets may be given only in accordance with the preceding paragraph, in connection with any sale and liquidation of all or a portion of the Assets, the preceding sentence, and, in all cases, the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

The Loan Obligation Manager shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or liquidation on the basis of the lowest of such bid prices for each such Pledged Loan Obligation and provide the Trustee with the results thereof.  For the purposes of determining issues relating to the market value of any Pledged Loan Obligation and the execution of a sale or other liquidation thereof, the Trustee may, but need not, retain at the expense of the Issuer and rely on an opinion of an Independent investment banking firm of national reputation in connection with a determination (notwithstanding that such opinion will not be the basis for such determination) as to whether the condition specified in  Section 5.5(a)(i)  exists.  
     
  The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Noteholders a report stating the results of any determination required to be made pursuant to  Section 5.5(a)(i) .

  (c)                                     the Trustee for 30 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such Proceeding; and 
     
  (d)                                    no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 30-day period by a Majority of the Controlling Class; it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Notes shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Notes of the same Class or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders of the Notes of the same Class or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Notes of the same Class subject to and in accordance with  Section 13.1  hereof and the Priority of Payments.

  No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein or a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default.

In no event shall the Trustee be required to register Unregistered Securities under the Securities Act. 
     
  (d)                                    The Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument of conveyance transferring its interest in any portion of the Assets in connection with a Sale thereof.

  (a)                                    Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: 
     
  (i)                                        the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and 
     
  (ii)                                     in the absence of manifest error, or bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;  provided ,  however , that in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they substantially conform to the requirements of this Indenture and shall promptly, but in any event within three Business Days in the case of an Officer s Certificate furnished by the Loan Obligation Manager, notify the party delivering the same if such certificate or opinion does not conform.  If a corrected form shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 15 days after such notice from the Trustee, the Trustee shall so notify the Noteholders. 
     
  (b)                                    In case an Event of Default known to the Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall, prior to the receipt of directions, if any, from a Majority of the Controlling Class (or other Noteholders to the extent provided in  Article 5  hereof), exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person s own affairs. 
     
  (c)                                     If, in performing its duties under this Indenture, the Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, the Trustee may request written instructions from 
     
 93

If the Trustee does not receive such instructions within two Business Days after it has requested them, it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action.  The Trustee shall act in accordance with instructions received after such two-Business Day period except to the extent it has already taken, or committed itself to take, action inconsistent with such instructions.  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the advice of legal counsel and Independent accountants in performing its duties hereunder and be deemed to have acted in good faith if it acts in accordance with such advice.  
     
  (d)                                    No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

  (iii)                                  the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Issuer in accordance with this Indenture and/or the Controlling Class relating to the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee in respect of any Note or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture; 
     
  (iv)                                 no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers contemplated hereunder, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it (if the amount of such funds or risk or liability does not exceed the amount payable to the Trustee pursuant to  Section 11.1(a)(i)(3)  and  Section 11.1(a)(ii)(1)  net of the amounts specified in  Section 6.7(a)(i) , the Trustee shall be deemed to be reasonably assured of such repayment) unless such risk or liability relates to its ordinary services under this Indenture, except where this Indenture provides otherwise; and 
     
  (v)                                    the Trustee shall not be liable to the Noteholders for any action taken or omitted by it at the direction of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Loan Obligation Manager, the Controlling Class and/or a Noteholder under circumstances in which such direction is required or permitted by the terms of this Indenture. 
     
  (e)                                     For all purposes under this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of any Event of Default described in  Section 5.1(d) ,  5.1(f) ,  5.1(g) ,  5.1(h) ,  5.1(i)  or  5.1(j)  or any Default described in  Section 5.1(e)  unless a Trust Officer assigned to and working in the Corporate Trust Office has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such an Event of Default or Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office, and such notice references, as applicable, the Notes 
     
 94

  (f)                                      Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of  Sections 6.1(a) ,  (b) ,  (c) ,  (d)  and  (e) .

  (g)                                     the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder (except with respect to its duty to make any Interest Advance under the circumstances specified in  Section 10.9 ) either directly or by or through agents or attorneys  provided  that the Trustee shall not be responsible for any willful misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent appointed and supervised, or attorney appointed, with due care by it hereunder (other than for affiliates of the Collateral Administrator);  provided ,  however , that the Trustee in any event shall remain responsible for the performance of its duties hereunder;

The Trustee shall receive amounts pursuant to this  Section 6.7  and  Section 11.1(a)  only to the extent that such payment is made in accordance with the Priority of Payments and the failure to pay such amounts to the Trustee will not, by itself, constitute an Event of Default.

If the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall fail to appoint a successor Trustee within 60 days after such resignation, removal or incapability or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee may be appointed by Act of a Majority of the Controlling Class delivered to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Loan Obligation Manager and the retiring Trustee.  The successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee and supersede any successor Trustee proposed by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer.  If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Issuer and the Co-Issuer or a Majority of the Controlling Class and shall have accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, subject to  Section 5.15 , the Controlling Class or any Holder may, on behalf of itself or himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

  (c)                                     the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the concurrence of the Issuer and the Co-Issuer evidenced by an Issuer Order, may accept the resignation of, or remove, any co-trustee appointed under this  Section 6.12 , and in case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall have the power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee without the concurrence of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer.  A successor to any co-trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this  Section 6.12 ;

  (c)                                     neither the execution or delivery by the Trustee of this Indenture nor the performance by the Trustee of its obligations under this Indenture requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to or the registration or filing with, any governmental authority or agency under any existing law of the United States of America governing the banking or trust powers of the Trustee; 
     
  (d)                                    neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Indenture, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Indenture, (i) is prohibited by, or requires the Trustee to obtain any consent, authorization, approval or registration under, any law, statute,

  (e)                                     there are no proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of the Trustee, threatened against the Trustee before any Federal, state or other governmental agency, authority, administrator or regulatory body, arbitrator, court or other tribunal, foreign or domestic, which could have a material adverse effect on the Assets or the performance by the Trustee of its obligations under this Indenture. 
     
  Section 6.15                                 Requests for Consents . 
     
  In the event that the Trustee receives written notice of any proposed amendment, consent or waiver under the Underlying Instruments of any Loan Obligation (before or after any default) or in the event any action is required to be taken in respect to an Underlying Instrument, the Trustee shall promptly contact the Issuer and the Loan Obligation Manager.

The Trustee is hereby authorized to withhold or deduct from amounts otherwise distributable to any Noteholder sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is legally required to be withheld or deducted (but such authorization shall not prevent the Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and legally withholding payment of such tax, pending the outcome of such proceedings).  The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to any Noteholder shall be treated as Cash distributed to such Noteholder at the time it is deducted or withheld by the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.  If there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a distribution, the Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this  Section 6.16 .  If any Noteholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with such Noteholder in making such claim so long as such Noteholder agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.  Nothing herein shall impose an obligation on the part of the Trustee to determine the amount of any tax or withholding obligation on the part of the Issuer or in respect of the Notes.

  (c)                                     if such Paying Agent is not the Trustee, immediately resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held by it for the payment of Notes if at any time it ceases to meet the standards set forth above required to be met by a Paying Agent at the time of its appointment; 
     
  (d)                                    if such Paying Agent is not the Trustee, immediately give the Trustee notice of any Default by the Issuer or the Co-Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment required to be made; and

At the cost of the Issuer, the Trustee shall provide to each Noteholder and each holder of Preferred Shares and, for so long as any Class of Notes shall remain Outstanding and is rated, the Trustee shall provide to the Rating Agencies a copy of any proposed supplemental indenture at least 15 Business Days prior to the execution thereof by the Trustee, and, for so long as such Notes are Outstanding and so rated, request written confirmation, which may be in electronic form, from each noteholder and holder of Preferred Shares, that such proposed supplemental indenture will not materially and adversely affect such Noteholder or holder of Preferred Shares, and, as soon as practicable after the execution by the

The Trustee shall not be liable for any such determination made in good faith and in reliance upon such Officer s Certificate.  
     
  Furthermore, the Trustee shall not enter into any such supplemental indenture unless the Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel from Cadwalader, Wickersham   Taft LLP or other nationally recognized U.S. tax counsel experienced in such matters that the proposed supplemental indenture will not cause the Issuer to (x) fail to be treated as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or other disregarded entity of a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (y) be treated as a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes or to otherwise become subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis.

No later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Payment Date (but in any event no earlier than one Business Day following the Advancing Agent s receipt of notice of such Interest Shortfall), the Advancing Agent shall advance the difference between such amounts (each such advance, an   Interest Advance  ) by deposit of an amount equal to such Interest Advance in the Payment Account, subject to a determination of recoverability by the Advancing Agent as described in  Section 10.9(b) , and subject in all events to a maximum limit in respect of any Payment Date equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate of such Interest Shortfalls that would otherwise occur on the Notes and (ii) the aggregate of the interest payments not received in respect of Loan Obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no circumstance will the Advancing Agent be required to make an Interest Advance in respect of a Loan Obligation to the extent that the aggregate outstanding amount of all unreimbursed Interest Advances would exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes.  Any Interest Advance made by the Advancing Agent with respect to a Payment Date 
     
 141   

that is in excess of the actual Interest Shortfall for such Payment Date shall be refunded to the Advancing Agent by the Trustee on the same Business Day that such Interest Advance was made (or, if such Interest Advance is made prior to final determination by the Trustee of such Interest Shortfall, on the Business Day of such final determination).  The Advancing Agent shall provide the Trustee written notice of a determination by the Advancing Agent that a proposed Interest Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Payment Date (or, in the event that the Advancing Agent did not receive notice of the related Interest Shortfall on the related Determination Date, no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately following the Advancing Agent s receipt of notice of such Interest Shortfall).  If the Advancing Agent shall fail to make any required Interest Advance at or prior to the time at which distributions are to be made pursuant to  Section 11.1(a) , the Backup Advancing Agent shall be required to make such Interest Advance, subject to a determination of recoverability by the Backup Advancing Agent as described in  Section 10.9(b) .  The Backup Advancing Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any affirmative determination by the Advancing Agent that an Interest Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance.  Based upon available information at the time, the Backup Advancing Agent, the Loan Obligation Manager or the Advancing Agent will provide 15 days prior notice to the Rating Agencies if recovery of a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance would result in an Interest Shortfall on the next succeeding Payment Date.  No later than the close of business on the Determination Date related to a Payment Date on which the recovery of a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance would result in an Interest Shortfall, the Loan Obligation Manager will provide the Rating Agencies notice of such recovery.  
     
  (b)                                    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Advancing Agent nor the Backup Advancing Agent, as applicable, shall be required to make any Interest Advance unless such Person determines, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith that such Interest Advance, or such proposed Interest Advance, plus interest expected to accrue thereon at the Reimbursement Rate, will be recoverable from subsequent payments or collections with respect to all Loan Obligations and has determined in its reasonable judgment that the recovery would not result in an Interest Shortfall.  In determining whether any proposed Interest Advance will be, or whether any Interest Advance previously made is, a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance, the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent, as applicable, will take into account: 
     
  (i)                                        amounts that may be realized on each Underlying Mortgaged Property in its  as is  or then-current condition and occupancy; 
     
  (ii)                                     the potential length of time before such Interest Advance may be reimbursed and the resulting degree of uncertainty with respect to such reimbursement; and 
     
  (iii)                                  the possibility and effects of future adverse changes with respect to the Underlying Mortgaged Properties, and 
     
  (iv)                                 the fact that Interest Advances are intended to provide liquidity only and not credit support to the Holders of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes. 
     
 142   

For purposes of any such determination of whether an Interest Advance constitutes or would constitute a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance, an Interest Advance will be deemed to be nonrecoverable if the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent, as applicable, determines that future Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds may be ultimately insufficient to fully reimburse such Interest Advance, plus interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate within a reasonable period of time.  Absent bad faith, the determination by the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent, as applicable, as to the nonrecoverability of any Interest Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders of the Notes.  
     
  (c)                                     Each of the Advancing Agent and the Backup Advancing Agent will be entitled to recover any previously unreimbursed Interest Advance made by it (including any Nonrecoverable Interest Advance to the extent made), together with interest thereon,  first , from Interest Proceeds and  second  (to the extent that there are insufficient Interest Proceeds for such reimbursement), from Principal Proceeds to the extent that such reimbursement would not trigger an additional Interest Shortfall;  provided  that if at any time an Interest Advance is determined to be a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance, the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent shall be entitled to recover all outstanding Interest Advances from the Collection Accounts on any Business Day during any Interest Accrual Period prior to the related Determination Date (or on a Payment Date prior to any payment of interest on or principal of the Notes in accordance with the Priority of Payments).  The Advancing Agent shall be permitted (but not obligated) to defer or otherwise structure the timing of recoveries of Nonrecoverable Interest Advances in such manner as the Advancing Agent determines is in the best interest of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, as a collective whole, which may include being reimbursed for Nonrecoverable Interest Advances in installments. 
     
  (d)                                    The Advancing Agent and the Backup Advancing Agent will each be entitled with respect to any Interest Advance made by it (including any Nonrecoverable Interest Advance to the extent made) to interest accrued on the amount of such Interest Advance for so long as it is outstanding at the Reimbursement Rate. 
     
  (e)                                     The obligations of the Advancing Agent and the Backup Advancing Agent to make Interest Advances in respect of the Loan Obligations will continue through the Stated Maturity Date, unless the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes are previously redeemed or repaid in full. 
     
  (f)                                      In no event will the Advancing Agent, in its capacity as such hereunder or the Trustee, in its capacity as Backup Advancing Agent hereunder, be required to advance any amounts in respect of payments of principal of any Loan Obligation. 
     
  (g)                                     In consideration of the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Advancing Agent shall be entitled to receive, at the times set forth herein and subject to the Priority of Payments, to the extent funds are available therefor, the Advancing Agent Fee.  In consideration of the Backup Advancing Agent s obligations hereunder, the Backup Advancing Agent shall be entitled to receive, at the times set forth herein and subject to the Priority of Payments, to the extent funds are available therefor, the Backup Advancing Agent Fee.  If the Backup Advancing Agent makes an Interest Advance that the Advancing Agent failed to make 
     
 143   

and did not determine to be nonrecoverable, the Backup Advancing Agent will be entitled to receive the Advancing Agent s Fee for so long as such Interest Advance is outstanding.  
     
  (h)                                    The determination by the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent, as applicable, (i) that it has made a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance or (ii) that any proposed Interest Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Interest Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer s Certificate delivered promptly to the Trustee (or, if applicable, retained thereby), the Issuer and the Rating Agencies, setting forth the basis for such determination;  provided  that failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of, or the Advancing Agent or the Backup Advancing Agent, entitlement to reimbursement with respect to, any Interest Advance. 
     
  (i)                                        If a Scheduled Distribution on any Loan Obligation is not paid to the Trustee on the Due Date therefor, the Trustee shall provide the Advancing Agent with notice of such default on the Business Day immediately following such default.  In addition, upon request, the Trustee shall provide the Advancing Agent (either electronically or in hard-copy format), with copies of all reports received from any trustee, trust administrator, master servicer or similar administrative entity with respect to the Loan Obligations and the Trustee shall promptly make available to the Advancing Agent any other information reasonably available to the Trustee by reason of its acting as Trustee hereunder to permit the Advancing Agent to make a determination of recoverability with respect to any Interest Advance and to otherwise perform its advancing functions under this Indenture.

Each of the Issuer and Loan Obligation Manager shall promptly forward to the Trustee any information in their possession or reasonably available to them concerning any of the Assets that the Trustee reasonably may request or that reasonably may be necessary to enable the Trustee to prepare any report or perform any duty or function on its part to be performed under the terms of this Indenture.

  (1)           the sum of (1) the Principal Balance of such Exchange Obligation  plus  (2) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon  plus  (3) the Cash amount (if any) to be paid to the Issuer in respect of such exchange by such affiliate of the Loan Obligation Manager, is equal to or greater than:  
     
  (2)           the sum of (1) the Principal Balance of the Defaulted Obligation sought to be exchanged  plus  (2) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  
     
  If a Loan Obligation that is a Defaulted Obligation is not sold by the Issuer (at the direction of the Loan Obligation Manager) within three years of such Loan Obligation becoming a Defaulted Obligation, the Loan Obligation Manager, on behalf of the Issuer, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such Loan Obligation as soon as commercially practicable thereafter.

  (i)            the Sale Proceeds therefrom must be used to pay certain expenses and redeem all of the Notes in whole but not in part pursuant to  Section 9.1 , and upon any such sale the Trustee shall release such Loan Obligation pursuant to  Section 10.12 ;  
     
  (ii)           the Issuer may not direct the Trustee to sell (and the Trustee shall not be required to release) a Loan Obligation pursuant to this  Section 12.1(b)  unless:  
     
  (1)           the Loan Obligation Manager certifies to the Trustee that, in the Loan Obligation Manager s reasonable business judgment based on calculations included in the certification (which shall include the sales prices of the Loan  
     
 160   

Obligations), the Sale Proceeds from the sale of one or more of the Loan Obligations and all Cash and proceeds from Eligible Investments will be at least equal to the Total Redemption Price; and  
     
  (2)           the Independent accountants appointed by the Issuer pursuant to  Section 10.13  shall recalculate the calculations made in clause (1) above and prepare an agreed-upon procedures report.

  (d)           In the event that any Notes remain Outstanding as of the Payment Date occurring six months prior to the Stated Maturity Date of the Notes, the Loan Obligation Manager will be required to determine whether the proceeds expected to be received on the Assets prior to the Stated Maturity Date of the Notes will be sufficient to pay in full the principal amount of (and accrued interest on) the Notes on the Stated Maturity Date.  If the Loan Obligation Manager determines, in its sole discretion, that such proceeds will not be sufficient to pay the outstanding principal amount of and accrued interest on the Notes (a   Note Liquidation Event  ) on the Stated Maturity Date of the Notes, the Issuer will, at the direction of the Loan Obligation Manager, be obligated to liquidate the portion of Loan Obligations sufficient to pay the remaining principal amount of and interest on the Notes on or before the Stated Maturity Date.

   MISCELLANEOUS   
     
  Section 14.1           Form of Documents Delivered to the Trustee .  
     
  In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.  
     
  Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such Authorized Officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.  Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Loan Obligation Manager or any other Person, stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Loan Obligation Manager or such other Person, unless such Authorized Officer of the Issuer or the Co-  
     
 165   

Issuer or such counsel knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.  Any Opinion of Counsel also may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an Authorized Officer of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, or the Loan Obligation Manager on behalf of the Issuer, certifying as to the factual matters that form a basis for such Opinion of Counsel and stating that the information with respect to such matters is in the possession of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer or the Loan Obligation Manager on behalf of the Issuer, unless such counsel knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.  
     
  Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.  
     
  Whenever in this Indenture it is  provided  that the absence of the occurrence and continuation of a Default or Event of Default is a condition precedent to the taking of any action by the Trustee at the request or direction of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, then notwithstanding that the satisfaction of such condition is a condition precedent to the Issuer s or the Co-Issuer s rights to make such request or direction, the Trustee shall be protected in acting in accordance with such request or direction if it does not have knowledge of the occurrence and continuation of such Default or Event of Default as provided in  Section 6.1(e) .

Such instrument or instruments (and the action or actions embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the   Act   of the Securityholders signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this  Section 14.2 .  
     
  (b)           The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.  
     
  In the event that, by reason of the suspension of the regular mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

Schedule B   
     
   LIBOR   
     
  The London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:  
     
  (1)                                    On the second London Banking Day preceding the first Business Day of an Interest Accrual Period (each such day, a  LIBOR Determination Date ), LIBOR (other than for the initial Interest Accrual Period) will equal the rate, as obtained by the Calculation Agent, for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period of one month, which appears on the Reuters Page LIBOR01 (or such other page that may replace that page on such service for the purpose of displaying comparable rates) as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets Commodities News as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date.   London Banking Day  means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealings in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London, England. 
     
  (2)                                    If, on any LIBOR Determination Date, such rate does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. Dollars are offered by Reference Banks at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the LIBOR Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for a period of one month commencing on the LIBOR Determination Date and in a representative amount of U.S.$1,000.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, the rate for that LIBOR Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the rate for that LIBOR Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the LIBOR Determination Date for loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks for a period of one month commencing on the LIBOR Determination Date and in a representative amount of U.S.$1,000.  As used herein,  Reference Banks  means four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent and approved by the Loan Obligation Manager. 
     
  (3)                                    In respect of the initial Interest Accrual Period, LIBOR will be determined on the second London Banking Day preceding the Closing Date. 
     
  (4)                                    In no event shall LIBOR be less than zero. 
     
  In making the above calculations, (A) all percentages resulting from the calculation (other than the calculation determined pursuant to clause (c) above) will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (0.00001%) and (B) all percentages determined pursuant to clause (c) above will be rounded, if necessary, in accordance with the method set forth in (A), but to the same degree of accuracy as the two rates used to make the determination (except that such percentages will not be rounded to a lower degree of accuracy than the nearest one thousandth of a percentage point (0.001%)).

Exhibit I   
     
   Representations and Warranties   
     
  All capitalized terms used in this schedule to Exhibit I will have the meanings assigned to such terms in the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement.  
     
  (1)                                     Whole Loan; Ownership of Loan Obligations .  Except for the Loan Obligations identified in Annex A to the Offering Memorandum as a Senior Participation, each Closing Date Loan Obligation is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan.  Each Additional Loan Obligation and Replacement Loan Obligation that is a Senior Participation is a senior portion (or a pari passu interest in a senior portion) of a whole mortgage loan.  At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Purchaser, no Note, Mortgage or Senior Participation was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation (other than with respect to the Senior Participations) or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Loan Obligation free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations (other than with respect to the Senior Participations), any other ownership interests on, in or to such Loan Obligation other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement.  Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Loan Obligation, and the assignment to Purchaser constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Loan Obligation free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Loan Obligation. 
     
  (2)                                     Loan Document Status . Each related Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related borrower, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related borrower, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance or prepayment fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the mortgagee s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the   Standard Qualifications  ). 
     
  Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentences, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related borrower with respect to any of the related Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.  
     
  (3)                                     Mortgage Provisions .  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications. 
     
  (4)                                     Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications .  Since origination and except prior to the Cut-off Date by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, participation agreement, if applicable, and related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage; (b) no related  
     
  I- 1   

Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related borrower nor the related guarantor nor the related Participating Institution has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable.  
     
  (5)                                     Lien; Valid Assignment .  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits from the Seller constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment from the Seller.  Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related borrower s fee or leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount subject to the Title Exceptions, Permitted Encumbrances and Standard Qualifications (each as defined herein). Each related Assignment of Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits from the Seller to the Purchaser constitutes the legal, valid and binding first priority assignment from the Seller, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Standard Qualifications, any Permitted Encumbrances and any Title Exceptions (as defined herein).  Each Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits is freely assignable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code (  UCC  ) financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection. 
     
  (6)                                     Permitted Liens; Title Insurance .  Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a  marked up  commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the   Title Policy  ) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to the following title exceptions (each such title exception, including any exceptions set forth on  Schedule 1(a)  to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement, a   Title Exception   and collectively, the   Title Exceptions  ): (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; and (f) if the related Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan (each a   Crossed Mortgage Loan  ), the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with such Crossed Mortgage Loan;  provided  that none of which items (a) through (f), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the borrower s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the   Permitted Encumbrances  ).  Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage.  Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy. 
     
  (7)                                     Junior Liens .  It being understood that B notes and junior participation interests secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Crossed Mortgage Loan, there are, as of origination, and to the Seller s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmens liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment  
     
  I- 2   

and other personal property financing).  Except as set forth in Schedule 1(b) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement, the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related borrower.  
     
  (8)                                     Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits .  There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related borrower to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.  The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the mortgagee. 
     
  (9)                                     UCC Filings .  The Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such borrower and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above.  No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection. 
     
  (10)                              Condition of Property .  Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan (i) inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property at least six months prior to origination of the Mortgage Loan and, (ii) if the term of the Mortgage Loan has already continued for at least twelve months, inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property at least once during the past twelve months. 
     
  An engineering report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan not more than twelve months prior to the origination of such Mortgage Loan.  To the Seller s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than (i) deferred maintenance or repairs for which escrows were established at origination and (ii) any damage fully covered by insurance) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.  
     
  (11)                              Taxes and Assessments .  All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, that could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon.  For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority. 
     
  I- 3   

(12)                              Condemnation .  As of the date of origination and to the Seller s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property. 
     
  (13)                              Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan .  As of the date of origination and to the Seller s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any borrower, guarantor, or borrower s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such borrower s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such borrower s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property. 
     
  (14)                              Escrow Deposits .  All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with lender pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with lender under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Purchaser or its servicer. 
     
  (15)                              No Holdbacks .  The Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date of the Mortgage Loan set forth on the mortgage loan schedule attached as Exhibit A to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the borrower or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such holdback). 
     
  (16)                              Insurance .  Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a  special cause of loss form  or  all risk form  that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least A or better and a financial class of X or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (collectively the   Insurance Rating Requirements  ), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the borrower and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property. 
     
  Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).  
     
  If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related borrower is required to maintain insurance in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.  
     
  If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related borrower is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or  named storms  issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.  
     
  I- 4   

The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $1 million in the aggregate.  
     
  An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit (  SEL  ) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer rated least  A:VIII  by A.M. Best Company or  A3  (or the equivalent) from Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or  A-   by Standard   Poor s Ratings Service in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL.  
     
  The Loan Documents provide that if a specified percentage (which is in no event greater than 20%) of the reasonably estimated aggregate fair market value of the Mortgaged Property is damaged or destroyed, the lender shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to apply the net casualty insurance proceeds received to the payment of the Mortgage Loan or to allow such proceeds to be used for the repair or restoration of the Mortgaged Property.  
     
  All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the lender under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee.  Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related borrower to maintain all such insurance and, at such borrower s failure to do so, authorizes the lender to maintain such insurance at the borrower s cost and expense and to charge such borrower for related premiums.  All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 30 days prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.  
     
  (17)                              Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots .  Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the borrower to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created. 
     
  (18)                              No Encroachments .  To Seller s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the lender s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a  marked up  commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the 
     
  I- 5   

removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with respect to the Title Policy.  
     
  (19)                              No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation .  No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation by Seller. 
     
  (20)                              Compliance with Usury Laws .  The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury. 
     
  (21)                              Authorized to do Business .  To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Note, each holder of the Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan. 
     
  (22)                              Trustee under Deed of Trust .  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee. 
     
  (23)                              Local Law Compliance .  To the Seller s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect s letter, a zoning consultant s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multi-family mortgage loans intended for securitization, with respect to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan and as of the Cut-off Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively   Zoning Regulations  ) other than those which (i) are insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance or other insurance policy or (ii) would not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.  The terms of the Loan Documents require the borrower to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws. 
     
  (24)                              Licenses and Permits .  Each borrower covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller s knowledge based upon a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multi-family mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.  The Mortgage Loan requires the related borrower to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located. 
     
  (25)                              Recourse Obligations .  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the related parties thereto except for certain carve-outs, including but not limited to the following: (a) the related borrower and at least one individual or entity shall be fully liable for actual losses, liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related borrower and/or its principals specified in the related Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or intentional material misrepresentation, (ii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, (iii)  intentional material physical waste of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained in the related Loan Documents, and (b) the Mortgage Loan shall become full recourse to the related borrower and at least one individual or entity, if the related borrower files a voluntary petition under federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law. 
     
  (26)                              Mortgage Releases .  The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial  
     
  I- 6   

release, accompanied by principal repayment of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (d) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation.  
     
  (27)                              Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls .  Each Mortgage requires the borrower to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly and annual operating statements, and quarterly rent rolls for properties and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one borrower are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the borrower entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members  capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis. 
     
  (28)                              Acts of Terrorism Exclusion .  With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and further amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as   TRIA  ), from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by commercial availability on commercially reasonable terms, or as otherwise indicated in Schedule 1(a) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement;  provided ,  however , that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then;  provided  that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the borrower shall not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance) at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount. 
     
  (29)                              Due on Sale or Encumbrance .  Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a  due on sale  or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily acceptable to the Seller lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related borrower, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related borrower, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the borrower, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the  
     
  I- 7   

related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraph (26) herein or the exceptions thereto set forth in Schedule 1(a) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement, or (vii) as set forth on Schedule 1(b) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on Schedule 1(c) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests, (iii) any Crossed Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule 1(d) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement, or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.  The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the borrower is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.  
     
  (30)                              Single-Purpose Entity .  Each Mortgage Loan requires the borrower to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding.  Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the borrower with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the borrower is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the borrower.  For this purpose, a   Single-Purpose Entity   shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a borrower for a Crossed Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity. 
     
  (31)                              Ground Leases .   For purposes of each Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement, a   Ground Lease   shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit. 
     
  With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns, Seller represents and warrants that:  
     
  (a)                                    The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.  The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage; 
     
  (b)                                    The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled or  
     
  I- 8   

terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the lender, and no such consent has been granted by the Seller since the origination of the Mortgage Loan except as reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;  
     
  (c)                                     The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes); 
     
  (d)                                    The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii)  is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee on the lessor s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject; 
     
  (e)                                     The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor; 
     
  (f)                                      The Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.  To the Seller s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date; 
     
  (g)                                     The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the lender unless such notice is given to the lender; 
     
  (h)                                    A lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the lender s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease; 
     
  (i)                                        The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Seller in connection with loans originated for securitization; 
     
  (j)                                       Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in clause (k) below) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the lender or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; 
     
  (k)                                    In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not  
     
  I- 9   

applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and  
     
  (l)                                        Provided that the lender cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with the lender upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
     
  (32)                              Servicing .  The servicing and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs. 
     
  (33)                              Origination and Underwriting .  The origination practices of the Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this Exhibit I. 
     
  (34)                              No Material Default; Payment Record .  No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace or cure period, in making required payments since origination, and as of the date hereof, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30 days delinquent (beyond any applicable grace or cure period) in making required payments as of the Closing Date.  To the Seller s knowledge, there is (a) no material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable, or (b) no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable, or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that this representation and warranty does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Seller in this Exhibit I.  No person other than the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the Loan Documents. 
     
  (35)                              Bankruptcy .  As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Seller s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, no borrower, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. 
     
  (36)                              Organization of Borrower .  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the borrower delivered by the borrower in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the borrower is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Except with respect to any Crossed Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a borrower that is an Affiliate of another borrower. (An   Affiliate   for purposes of this paragraph (36) means, a borrower that is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another borrower.) 
     
  (37)                              Environmental Conditions .  A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an   ESA  ) meeting ASTM requirements conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan was delivered to seller within 12 months prior to the origination date of each Mortgage Loan (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA (i) did not identify the existence of recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter   Environmental Condition  ) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation, or (ii) if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least one of the following statements is true:  (A) an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient to cover the  
     
  I- 10   

estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the Environmental Condition has been escrowed by the related borrower and is held or controlled by the related lender; (B) if the only Environmental Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, and the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to be instituted by the related borrower that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C) the Environmental Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority (or the Environmental Condition affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as  closed  or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D) a secured creditor environmental policy or a pollution legal liability insurance policy that covers liability for the Environmental Condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody s, S P and/or Fitch; (E) a party not related to the borrower was identified as the responsible party for such Environmental Condition and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F) a party related to the borrower having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action.  To Seller s knowledge, except as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.  
     
  (38)                              Appraisal .  The Servicing File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within six months of the Mortgage Loan origination date.  The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is either a Member of the Appraisal Institute (  MAI  ) and/or has been licensed and certified to prepare appraisals in the state where the Mortgaged Property is located. Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice  as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and has certified that such appraiser had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the borrower or in any loan made on the security thereof, and its compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan. 
     
  (39)                              Loan Obligation Schedule .  The information pertaining to each Loan Obligation that is set forth in the schedule attached as Exhibit A to the Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement is true and correct in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date and contains all information required by the Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement to be contained therein. 
     
  (40)                              Cross-Collateralization .  No Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any mortgage loan that is not owned by the Issuer, except as set forth in Schedule 1(d) to the applicable Loan Obligations Purchase Agreement. 
     
  (41)                              Advance of Funds by the Seller .  After origination, no advance of funds has been made by Seller to the related borrower other than in accordance with the Loan Documents, and, to Seller s knowledge, no funds have been received from any person other than the related borrower or an affiliate for, or on account of, payments due on the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the Loan Documents, such as, by way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a lender-controlled lockbox if required or contemplated under the related lease or Loan Documents).  Neither Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation to make any capital contribution to any borrower under a Mortgage Loan, other than contributions made on or prior to the date hereof. 
     
  (42)                              Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws .  Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator) has complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including without limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan, the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan. 
     
  (43)                              Floating Interest Rates . Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR. 
     
  I- 11   

(44)                              Participations . With respect to each Loan Obligation that is a Participation: 
     
  (i)                       Either (A) the Participation is treated as a real estate asset for purposes of Section 856(c) of the Code, and the interest payable pursuant to such Participation is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property or on an interest in real property for purposes of Section 856(c) of the Code, or (B) the Participation qualifies as a security that would not otherwise cause ARMS Equity to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code (including after the sale, transfer and assignment to the Issuer of such Senior Participation); 
     
  (ii)                    To the actual knowledge of the Seller, as of the Closing Date, the related Participating Institution was not a debtor in any outstanding proceeding pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code;

  (iv)                The participation agreement is legal, valid and enforceable as between its parties; 
     
  (v)                   Each other participant (each, a   Third Party Participant   )  is required to pay its pro rata share of any expenses, costs and fees associated with servicing and enforcing rights and remedies under the related Loan Obligation upon request therefor by the related servicer or lead and control participant (the   Lead Participant   
     
  (vi)                Each participation agreement is effective to convey the participation interest to the related participants and is not intended to be or effective as a loan or other financing secured by the Loan Obligation or the underlying Whole Loan.  If the Issuer will be the Lead Participant, the Lead Participant owes no fiduciary duty or obligation to any third party participant pursuant to the participation agreement; 
     
  (vii)             All amounts due and owing to any Third Party Participant pursuant to each participation agreement have been duly and timely paid.  There is no default by the Lead Participant, or to the Seller s knowledge, by any Third Party Participant under any participation agreement; 
     
  (viii)          The participation interest and, if being transferred to the Issuer, the Lead Participant role, rights and responsibilities are assignable by the Seller without consent or approval other than those that have been obtained; 
     
  (ix)                If the Issuer will be the Lead Participant, the terms of the participation agreement do not require or obligate the Lead Participant or its successor or assigns to repurchase the participation interest under any circumstances; and 
     
  (x)                   The Seller, in selling any other participation interest to a Third Party Participant, made no misrepresentation, fraud or omission of information necessary for such Third Party Participant to make an informed decision to purchase its participation interest. 
     
  For purposes of these representations and warranties, the phrases  the Seller s knowledge  or  the Seller s belief  and other words and phrases of like import shall mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth herein, the actual state of knowledge or belief of the Seller, its officers and employees directly responsible for the underwriting, origination, servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding the matters expressly set forth herein.

SCHEDULE 1(a)    
     
   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RE:  LOAN OBLIGATIONS   
     
  (1)                                     Whole Loan; Ownership of Loan Obligations .  Except for the Loan Obligations identified on Annex A to the Offering Memorandum as a Senior Participation or as a Junior Participation, each Closing Date Loan Obligation is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan.  Each Additional Loan Obligation and Replacement Loan Obligation that is a Senior Participation is a senior portion (or a pari passu interest in a senior portion) of a whole mortgage loan.  At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Purchaser, no Note, Mortgage or Senior Participation was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation (other than with respect to the Senior Participations) or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Loan Obligation free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations (other than with respect to the Senior Participations), any other ownership interests on, in or to such Loan Obligation other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement.  Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Loan Obligation, and the assignment to Purchaser constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Loan Obligation free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Loan Obligation. 
     
  (2)                                     Loan Document Status . Each related Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance or prepayment fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the mortgagee s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the   Standard Qualifications  ). 
     
  Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentences, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Borrower with respect to any of the related Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.  
     
  (3)                                     Mortgage Provisions .  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications. 
     
  (4)                                     Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications .  Since origination and except prior to the Cut-off Date by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, participation agreement, if applicable, and related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect 

which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related Borrower nor the related guarantor nor the related Participating Institution has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable.  
     
  (5)                                     Lien; Valid Assignment .  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits from the Seller constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment from the Seller.  Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Borrower s fee or leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount subject to the Title Exceptions, Permitted Encumbrances and Standard Qualifications (each as defined herein). Each related Assignment of Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits from the Seller to the Purchaser constitutes the legal, valid and binding first priority assignment from the Seller, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Standard Qualifications, any Permitted Encumbrances and any Title Exceptions (as defined herein).  Each Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits is freely assignable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code (  UCC  ) financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection. 
     
  (6)                                     Permitted Liens; Title Insurance .  Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a  marked up  commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the   Title Policy  ) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to the following title exceptions (each such title exception, including any exceptions set forth on  Schedule 1(a)  hereto, a   Title Exception   and collectively, the   Title Exceptions  ): (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; and (f) if the related Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan (each a   Crossed Mortgage Loan  ), the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with such Crossed Mortgage Loan, provided that none of which items (a) through (f), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Borrower s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the   Permitted Encumbrances  ).  Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage.  Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy. 
     
  (7)                                     Junior Liens .  It being understood that B notes and junior participation interests secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Crossed Mortgage Loan, there are, as of origination, and to the Seller s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmens liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment 

and other personal property financing).  Except as set forth in  Schedule 1(b) , the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Borrower.  
     
  (8)                                     Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits .  There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Borrower to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.  The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the mortgagee. 
     
  (9)                                     UCC Filings .  The Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Borrower and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above.  No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection. 
     
  (10)                              Condition of Property .  Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan (i) inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property at least six months prior to origination of the Mortgage Loan and, (ii) if the term of the Mortgage Loan has already continued for at least twelve months, inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property at least once during the past twelve months. 
     
  An engineering report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan not more than twelve months prior to the origination of such Mortgage Loan.  To the Seller s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than (i) deferred maintenance or repairs for which escrows were established at origination and (ii) any damage fully covered by insurance) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.  
     
  (11)                              Taxes and Assessments .  All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, that could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon.  For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority. 
     
  (12)                              Condemnation .  As of the date of origination and to the Seller s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off 

Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.  
     
  (13)                              Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan .  As of the date of origination and to the Seller s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Borrower, guarantor, or Borrower s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such Borrower s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Borrower s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property. 
     
  (14)                              Escrow Deposits .  All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with lender pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with lender under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Purchaser or its servicer. 
     
  (15)                              No Holdbacks .  The Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date of the Mortgage Loan set forth on the mortgage loan schedule attached as  Exhibit A  to this Agreement has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Borrower or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such holdback). 
     
  (16)                              Insurance .  Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a  special cause of loss form  or  all risk form  that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least A or better and a financial class of X or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (collectively the   Insurance Rating Requirements  ), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Borrower and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property. 
     
  Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).  
     
  If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Borrower  is required to maintain insurance  in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.  
     
  If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related Borrower is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or  named storms  issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.  

The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $1 million in the aggregate.  
     
  An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit (  SEL  ) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer rated least  A:VIII  by A.M. Best Company or  A3  (or the equivalent) from Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or  A-   by Standard   Poor s Ratings Service in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL.  
     
  The Loan Documents provide that if a specified percentage (which is in no event greater than 20%) of the reasonably estimated aggregate fair market value of the Mortgaged Property is damaged or destroyed, the lender shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to apply the net casualty insurance proceeds received to the payment of the Mortgage Loan or to allow such proceeds to be used for the repair or restoration of the Mortgaged Property.  
     
  All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the lender under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee.  Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Borrower to maintain all such insurance and, at such Borrower s failure to do so, authorizes the lender to maintain such insurance at the Borrower s cost and expense and to charge such Borrower for related premiums.  All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 30 days prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.  
     
  (17)                              Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots .  Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access  via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created. 
     
  (18)                              No Encroachments .  To Seller s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the lender s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a  marked up  commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the 

removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with respect to the Title Policy.  
     
  (19)                              No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation .  No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation by Seller. 
     
  (20)                              Compliance with Usury Laws .  The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury. 
     
  (21)                              Authorized to do Business .  To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Note, each holder of the Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan. 
     
  (22)                              Trustee under Deed of Trust .  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee. 
     
  (23)                              Local Law Compliance .  To the Seller s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect s letter, a zoning consultant s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multi-family mortgage loans intended for securitization, with respect to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan and as of the Cut-off Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively   Zoning Regulations  ) other than those which (i) are insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance or other insurance policy or (ii) would not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.  The terms of the Loan Documents require the Borrower to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws. 
     
  (24)                              Licenses and Permits .  Each Borrower covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller s knowledge based upon a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multi-family mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.  The Mortgage Loan requires the related Borrower to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located. 
     
  (25)                              Recourse Obligations .  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the related parties thereto except for certain carve-outs, including but not limited to the following: (a) the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity shall be fully liable for actual losses, liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related Borrower and/or its principals specified in the related Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or intentional material misrepresentation, (ii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, (iii) intentional material physical waste of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained in the related Loan Documents, and (b) the Mortgage Loan shall become full recourse to the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity, if the related Borrower files a voluntary petition under federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law. 

(26)                              Mortgage Releases .  The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (d) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation. 
     
  (27)                              Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls .  Each Mortgage requires the Borrower to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly and annual operating statements, and quarterly rent rolls for properties and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Borrower are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the Borrower entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members  capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis. 
     
  (28)                              Acts of Terrorism Exclusion .  With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and further amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as   TRIA  ), from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by commercial availability on commercially reasonable terms, or as otherwise indicated in  Schedule 1(a) ;  provided ,  however , that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the Borrower under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Borrower shall not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance) at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the Borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount. 
     
  (29)                              Due on Sale or Encumbrance .  Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a  due on sale  or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily acceptable to the Seller lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Borrower, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the 

related Borrower, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Borrower, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraph (26) herein or the exceptions thereto set forth in  Schedule 1(a) , or (vii) as set forth on  Schedule 1(b)  hereto by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on  Schedule 1(c)  hereto or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests, (iii) any Crossed Mortgage Loan as set forth on  Schedule 1(d)  hereto, or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.  The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Borrower is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.  
     
  (30)                              Single-Purpose Entity .  Each Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding.  Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the Borrower with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Borrower is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Borrower.  For this purpose, a   Single-Purpose Entity   shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Borrower for a Crossed Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity. 
     
  (31)                              Ground Leases .   For purposes of this Agreement, a   Ground Lease   shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit. 
     
  With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns, Seller represents and warrants that:  
     
  (a)                                    The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.  The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage; 

(b)                                    The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or  modified, or canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the lender, and no such consent has been granted by the Seller since the origination of the Mortgage Loan except as reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File; 
     
  (c)                                     The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes); 
     
  (d)                                    The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii)  is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee on the lessor s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject; 
     
  (e)                                     The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor; 
     
  (f)                                      The Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.  To the Seller s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date; 
     
  (g)                                     The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the lender unless such notice is given to the lender; 
     
  (h)                                    A lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the lender s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease; 
     
  (i)                                        The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Seller in connection with loans originated for securitization; 
     
  (j)                                       Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in clause (k) below) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the lender or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; 

(k)                                    In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and 
     
  (l)                                        Provided that the lender cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with the lender upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
     
  (32)                              Servicing .  The servicing and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs. 
     
  (33)                              Origination and Underwriting .  The origination practices of the Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this  Schedule 1(a) . 
     
  (34)                              No Material Default; Payment Record .

To the Seller s knowledge, there is (a) no material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable, or (b) no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or participation agreement, if applicable, or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that this representation and warranty does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Seller in this  Schedule 1(a) .  No person other than the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the Loan Documents.

Except with respect to any Crossed Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Borrower that is an Affiliate of another Borrower. (An   Affiliate   for purposes of this paragraph (36) means, a Borrower that is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another Borrower.) 
     
  (37)                              Environmental Conditions .  A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an   ESA  ) meeting ASTM requirements conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan was delivered to seller within 12 months prior to the origination date of each Mortgage Loan (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA (i) did not identify the existence of recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM 

E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter   Environmental Condition  ) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation, or (ii) if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least one of the following statements is true:  (A) an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the Environmental Condition has been escrowed by the related Borrower and is held or controlled by the related lender; (B) if the only Environmental Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, and the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to be instituted by the related Borrower that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C) the Environmental Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority (or the Environmental Condition affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as  closed  or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D) a secured creditor environmental policy or a pollution legal liability insurance policy that covers liability for the Environmental Condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody s, S P and/or Fitch; (E) a party not related to the Borrower was identified as the responsible party for such Environmental Condition and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F) a party related to the Borrower having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action.  To Seller s knowledge, except as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.

Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice  as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and has certified that such appraiser had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Borrower or in any loan made on the security thereof, and its compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan. 
     
  (39)                              Loan Obligation Schedule .

Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator) has complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including without limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan, the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan. 

(43)                              Floating Interest Rates . Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR. 
     
  (44)                              Participations . With respect to each Loan Obligation that is a Participation: 
     
  (i)           Either (A) the Participation is treated as a real estate asset for purposes of Section 856(c) of the Code, and the interest payable pursuant to such Participation is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property or on an interest in real property for purposes of Section 856(c) of the Code, or (B) the Participation qualifies as a security that would not otherwise cause ARMS Equity to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code (including after the sale, transfer and assignment to the Issuer of such Senior Participation);

  (vi)          Each participation agreement is effective to convey the participation interest to the related participants and is not intended to be or effective as a loan or other financing secured by the Loan Obligation or the underlying Whole Loan.  If the Issuer will be the Lead Participant, the Lead Participant owes no fiduciary duty or obligation to any third party participant pursuant to the participation agreement;  
     
  (vii)         All amounts due and owing to any Third Party Participant pursuant to each participation agreement have been duly and timely paid.  There is no default by the Lead Participant, or to the Seller s knowledge, by any Third Party Participant under any participation agreement;  
     
  (viii)        The participation interest and, if being transferred to the Issuer, the Lead Participant role, rights and responsibilities are assignable by the Seller without consent or approval other than those that have been obtained;  
     
  (ix)          If the Issuer will be the Lead Participant, the terms of the participation agreement do not require or obligate the Lead Participant or its successor or assigns to repurchase the participation interest under any circumstances; and  
     
  (x)           The Seller, in selling any other participation interest to a Third Party Participant, made no misrepresentation, fraud or omission of information necessary for such Third Party Participant to make an informed decision to purchase its participation interest.

 15   

Exchange Act (each a   Placement Agent Indemnitee  ), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, out-of-pocket legal fees and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action, investigations or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Time of Sale Information or the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information with respect to which the Placement Agent has agreed to indemnify each of the Issuer, Co-Issuer and ART pursuant to  Section 6(b)  hereof;  provided  that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from the Time of Sale Information, the indemnity agreement contained in this  paragraph (a)  with respect to the Time of Sale Information shall not inure to the benefit of a Placement Agent Indemnitee, to the extent that the sale to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial sale by the Placement Agent and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to the Placement Agent results from the fact that (i) prior to the occurrence of the events described in  clause (ii)  below, and prior to the Time of Sale, the Co-Issuers or ART shall have notified the Placement Agent that the Time of Sale Information contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented Time of Sale Information and such corrected Time of Sale Information was provided to the Placement Agent far enough in advance of the Time of Sale (but not less than one (1) Business Day) so that such corrected Time of Sale Information could have been provided (electronically or otherwise) to such person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability prior to the Time of Sale and (iii) the Placement Agent did not send or give such corrected Time of Sale Information to such person at or prior to the Time of Sale.  
     
  (b)                                     Indemnification of the Co-Issuers and ART by Placement Agent .  The Placement Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Co-Issuers and ART and their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls any of the Co-Issuers or ART within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in  subsection (a)  above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Placement Agent Information. 
     
  (c)                                     [Reserved] 
     
  (d)                                     Notice and Procedures .  If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to  paragraph (a)  or  (b)  above, such person (the   Indemnified Person  ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the   Indemnifying Person  ) in writing;  provided  that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may 
     
 16   

have under this  Section 6  except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure (in which case the Indemnifying Person shall be relieved of its indemnification obligation only to the extent of any loss caused by the Indemnified Person s failure to provide notice); and  provided further , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this  Section 6 .  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this  Section 6  that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; or (iii) the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Person to represent the Indemnified Person would present such counsel with a conflict of interest.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for the Placement Agent, its affiliates, directors, officers and any control persons of the Placement Agent shall be designated in writing by the Placement Agent and any such separate firm for the Co-Issuers and ART, their respective directors and officers and any person who controls the Co-Issuers or ART, as applicable, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall be designated in writing by the Co-Issuers and ART.  Upon receipt of notice from the Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Person of counsel, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this  Section 6  for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless the Indemnified Person shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the third immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel).  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such settlement does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Person.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the  
     
 17   

Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.  
     
  (e)                                      Contribution .  If the indemnification provided for in  subsections (a)  or  (b)  above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Co-Issuers and ART on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by  clause (i)  is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in  clause (i)  but also the relative fault of the Co-Issuers or ART on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Co-Issuers and ART on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Co-Issuers and/or ART from the sale of the Notes and the total fees, discounts and commissions received by the Placement Agent in connection therewith bear to the aggregate offering price of the Notes.  The relative fault of the Co-Issuers and ART on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Co-Issuers or ART or by the Placement Agent and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. 
     
  (f)                                       Limitation on Liability .  Each of the Co-Issuers, ART and the Placement Agent agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this  Section 6  were determined by  pro rata  allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in  paragraph (e)  above.
