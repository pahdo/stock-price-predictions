     FRONTERA GROUP INC.    For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements    (Unaudited)             Note 1   Organization and Operations          Frontera Group Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 21, 2013, Frontera Group Inc. is an export management company providing business development and market consultancy services that assist small and medium-sized businesses in entering new markets in Central and South America.          Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies            Basis of Presentation   Unaudited Interim Financial Information           The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2016 and notes thereto contained in the information as part of the Company s Annual Report on the Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2016.           Use of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).  Actual results could differ from those estimates.                 Earnings per Share           Earnings Per Share is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share.  Earnings per share ("EPS") is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.          The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.         There were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued and outstanding at any time during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.           Subsequent Events               8              The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.  Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.           Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements           Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.          Note 3   Going Concern          The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.         As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.         The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company s daily operations.  Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering.  While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.         The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.         Note 4   Related Party Transactions          Consulting services from President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer         Consulting services provided by the former President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and the former Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:             (i)      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $1,050 of these related party consulting services was recognized in cost of revenues and $0 and $450, respectively, in officers  compensation within operating expenses.               9                Advances         from         President and CEO           From time to time, the President, CEO and significant stockholder of the Company advances funds to the Company for working capital purposes. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the advance balance was $10,713 and $30,500, respectively.           Accrued Compensation          Prior to January 2016, the former President and former Chief Financial Officer provided management consulting services to the Company. On February 1, 2014, we have entered into consulting agreements with Michael Krichevcev, our former President, and Tatiana Varuha, our former Chief Financial Officer. These agreements were extended for the period from February 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016 on the same terms and conditions as the agreements dated February 1, 2014.  In January 2016, when Michael Krichevcev and Tatiana Varuha were no longer the officers of the Company, the Company terminated the management consulting engagement with them. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $0 and $1,500, respectively, in management consulting services with the former President of the Company in each period.          Note 5   Subsequent Event         The Company has evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported.  The Management of the Company determined that there were no reportable subsequent events to be disclosed.        10              ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.          Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks.          The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the MD A are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.            Frontera Group Inc. is an  emerging growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and will remain an "emerging growth company" until the earliest to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which its total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering, (c) the date on which Frontera Group has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (d) the date on which Frontera Group is deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "EXCHANGE ACT").         For so long as Frontera Group remains an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" as described in further detail in the risk factors below. Frontera Group cannot predict if investors will find its shares of common stock less attractive because Frontera Group will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find Frontera Group's shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its shares of common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.         If Frontera Group avails itself of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, its reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate Frontera Group and may result in less investor confidence.         The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on "emerging growth companies". Frontera Group meets the definition of an "emerging growth company" and so long as it qualifies as an "emerging growth company," it will not be required to:           have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;       comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);       submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency;  and       disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation.         In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.               In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, Frontera Group is choosing to "opt out" of such extended transition period, and as a result, Frontera Group will comply with new or revised accounting standards on          11              the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that its decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.         Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a  smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a  smaller reporting company , at such time are we cease being an  emerging growth company , we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings.  However, similar to  emerging growth companies ,  smaller reporting companies  are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to conduct say-on-pay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2013; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.          Results of operations for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.          Revenue        Our gross revenue for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $2,000 respectively.  Our cost of revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $0 (September 30, 2015: $1,050) resulting in a gross profit of $0 and $950, respectively. All of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015 derived from consulting services related to market research and feasibility studies and translation services. We did not perform any consulting services during the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in a decrease in revenues and gross margin compared to the same period in our 2015fiscal year.        Costs and Expenses         The major components of our expenses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below:      
            Compensation - officers         During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $0 and $1,650, respectively, in management consulting services from the former President and former CFO of the Company.  The decrease in compensation was due to the termination of the management consulting agreements with the Company s former President and former CFO in January 2016.         Professional fees.              12             The decrease in the professional fees of $4,750 was due to a reduction in legal or audit services utilized during the three months ended September 30, 2016.         General and Administrative         The decrease in general and administrative expenses of $6,442 was a result of limited business activity and no general and administrative expense was incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2016.        Net Loss        During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $665 compared to a net loss of $12,542 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The significant decrease in net loss was due to that no compensation, no professional fee and no general and administrative expense were incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2016.            Liquidity and Capital Resources                Liquidity         If we are not successful in expanding our clientele base, maintaining profitability and positive cash flow, additional capital may be required to maintain ongoing operations. We have explored and are continuing to explore options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of action. Such actions include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from our directors or other third parties, and other similar actions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common stock, loans from financial institutions, our directors, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.        Cash Flows         The table below, for the period indicated, provides selected cash flow information:                  13               Cash Flows from Operating Activities         During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we used $0 in operating activities compared to $20,126 used in operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $20,126.       The decrease of the cash used in operating activities was due to reductions in operating expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016.         Cash Flows from Investing Activities         We did not generate or use any cash from investing activities during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.          Cash Flows from Financing Activities          During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we neither generated nor used funds in financing activities.        Management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek, in addition to equity financing, other sources of financing (e.g. bank loan, line of credit, shareholder loan) on favorable terms; however, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.          If we are unable to generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail operations.  Furthermore, there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the Company s operations.          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.         ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.        We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.           ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls          We evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This evaluation was conducted with the participation of our chief executive officer and our principal accounting officer.         Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information that we are required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported.           Limitations on the Effective of Controls          Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system are met.  Further, any control system          14              reflects limitations on resources, and the benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs.  These limitations also include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control.  A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.          Conclusions          Based upon their evaluation of our controls, the chief executive officer and principal accounting officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, the disclosure controls are not effective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to us is made known to management on a timely basis during the period when our reports are being prepared.  There were no changes in our internal controls that occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.         PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.        We were not subject to any legal proceedings during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and currently we are not involved in any pending litigation or legal proceeding.        ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.    We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.         ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.        No equity securities were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016.        ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.        No senior securities were issued and outstanding during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016.         ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.        Not applicable to our Company.        ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.        None.        ITEM 6.
