1.  
  NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS  
   
 Atlantic Resources Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 9, 2007 and is in the exploration stage. On January 14, 2015, the Company merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rise Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation, in and to the Company to effect a name change from Patriot Minefinders Inc. to Rise Resources Inc.  Rise Resources Inc. was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the change of name.   
   
 On February 16, 2015, the Company increased its authorized capital from 21,000,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares.   
   
 On January 29, 2016, the Company completed an initial public offering in Canada and began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange ( CSE ) on February 1, 2016. 
   
 The Company is in the early stages of exploration and as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has incurred a loss of $297,152 for the period ended October 31, 2016 and has accumulated a deficit of $2,134,121.  This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan, which is typical for a start-up company.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 Management of the Company ( management ) is of the opinion that sufficient financing will be obtained from external financing and further share issuances to meet the Company s obligations.  At October 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $155,616.  
   
  2.  
  BASIS OF PREPARATION  
   
  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for financial information with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K.  Results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved in the future.  The unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management s Discussion and Analysis, for the year ended July 31, 2016.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. 
   
  Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
   
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  This ASU eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet and replaces it with a noncurrent classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard.

2.  
  BASIS OF PREPARATION  (cont d ) 
   
  Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards  (cont d ) 
   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities .  This ASU amendment addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  It affects investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value by requiring a qualitative assessment.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard.  
   
 Other than the above, the Company has determined that other significant newly issued accounting pronouncements and are either not applicable to the Company s business or that no material effect is expected on the financial statements as a result of future adoption. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of condensed interim financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant areas requiring the use of estimates include the valuation allowance applied to deferred income taxes and valuation of stock options and agent warrants.  Actual results could differ from those estimates, and would impact future results of operations and cash flows. 
   
  3.  
  MINERAL PROPERTY OPTION  
   
  Title to Mineral Properties  
   
 Title to mineral properties involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of certain mineral titles as well as the potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveying history characteristic of many mineral properties. As at October 31, 2016, the Company does not hold titles to any mineral properties. 
   
  Indata, British Columbia  
   
 On May 18, 2015, the Company entered into an option agreement with Eastfield Resources Ltd., ( Eastfield ), pursuant to which Eastfield granted the Company the exclusive and irrevocable right to acquire up to a 75% interest in and to certain claims in the Indata property located in the Omineca Mining Division in British Columbia, Canada.  In order to earn the initial 60% interest, the Company is required to pay Eastfield an aggregate of $350,000 ($50,000 paid to date; $30,000 paid in the current year) in cash and incur a minimum of $2,000,000 in aggregate exploration expenditures on the property by April 3, 2019.  In order to earn the additional 15% interest, the Company is required to pay Eastfield $100,000 cash within 90 days of earning the 60% interest and incur a further $500,000 in aggregate annual exploration expenditures on the property until such time as the Company is able to complete a feasibility study on the property.  As at October 31, 2016, the Company has incurred cumulative exploration expenditures of $4,035 on the Indata property.

  MINERAL PROPERTY OPTION  (cont d ) 
   
  Klondike, British Columbia  
   
 On May 26, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Klondike Gold Corp. ( Klondike ) regarding the purchase of a portfolio of seven gold and base metal properties in southeast British Columbia.  Under the agreement, within 60 days of signing, the Company paid Klondike $50,000 in cash, issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $240,000, and issued 1,500,000 warrants valued at $223,031 (discount rate   0.49%, volatility   200.64%, expected life   2 years, dividend yield   0%), exercisable at $0.227 per share until July 13, 2018.  On the one year anniversary of the first closing, the Company will pay Klondike $150,000 in cash, issue 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and issue 1,000,000 warrants.  Klondike will retain a 2% net smelter return royalty ( NSR ) and the Company will have the right to purchase 50% of the NSR for $1,000,000 at any time after the first closing.  Each of the warrants is exercisable for a period of two years into one share of the Company s common stock at a price that is a 20% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price of the stock on the CSE immediately prior to the date of issuance.  As at October 31, 2016, the Company has incurred cumulative exploration expenditures of $10,408 on the Klondike properties. 
   
  US Property  
   
 On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into an option agreement with three parties to purchase a 100% interest in and to certain lands and surface rights in the United States.  Upon execution of the option agreement, the Company paid the vendors a non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of $32,758 (US$25,000), which has been recorded as a long-term asset at October 31, 2016; an additional cash payment of US$2,000,000 is required to exercise the option. To exercise the option, this payment is due by December 26, 2016. 
   
  4.  
  CONTINGENCY  
   
 During the year ended July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent ( LOI ) with Wundr Software Inc. ( Wundr ).  Under the terms of the LOI, the Company would acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Wundr. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Company did not complete the transactions contemplated in the LOI, which the Company announced had expired on January 10, 2014.  
   
 On September 17, 2014, the Company learned that it was the subject, along with a number of additional defendants, of a notice of civil claim (the  Claim ) filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by Wundr, under which Wundr is seeking general damages from the Company as well as damages for conspiracy to cause economic harm.  None of the allegations contained in the Claim have been proven in court.  Management has determined that the probability of the Claim resulting in an unfavourable outcome and financial loss to the Company is unlikely. 
   
  5.  
  BAD DEBT EXPENSE  
   
 During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company advanced to Skanderbeg Capital Partners Inc. a total of $7,126, which had been recorded in prepaid expenses to be applied to future rent expense.  As the Company moved its premises during the year ended July 31, 2016, management has assessed the recoverability of the amount and recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $7,126 for the year ended July 31, 2016.

In order to earn the initial 60% interest, the Company is required to pay Eastfield an aggregate of $350,000 in cash and incur a minimum of $2,000,000 in aggregate exploration expenditures on the Indata Property by April 3, 2019.   In order to earn the additional 15% interest, it is required to pay Eastfield $100,000 within 90 days of earning the 60% interest and incur a further $500,000 in aggregate annual exploration expenditures on the  Indata  Property until such time as the Company is able to complete a feasibility study on the property.  Upon the completion of a feasibility study, the additional 15% interest will be deemed to have been earned.  
   
 Prior to entering into the Option Agreement, the Company was a development stage company engaged in exploring and evaluating potential strategic transactions in multiple industries, including but not limited to mineral properties and technology. 
   
 On May 31, 2016, the Company entered into a property purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Klondike Gold Corp., a British Columbia company with its common shares listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol  KG  ( Klondike ), regarding the purchase of a portfolio of seven gold and base metal properties in southeast British Columbia consisting of 150 mining claims with a total area of 28,000 hectares (collectively, the  Klondike Properties ).  Under the Purchase Agreement, on July 13, 2016 (the  First Closing ), the Company paid Klondike $50,000 in cash, issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and issued 1,500,000 warrants exercisable at a price of $0.227 per share until July 13, 2018.  On the one year anniversary of the First Closing, the Company is required to pay Klondike $150,000 in cash, issue 2,000,000 shares of the Company s  

3 

common stock, and issue 1,000,000 warrants.  Klondike will retain a 2% net smelter return royalty ( NSR ) and the Company will have the right to purchase 50% of the NSR for $1,000,000 at any time after the First Closing.  Each of the warrants is exercisable for a period of two years into one share of the Company s common stock at a price that is a 20% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price of the stock on the CSE immediately prior to the date of issuance. 
   
 On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into an option agreement with three parties to purchase an undivided 100% interest in and to certain mineral lands and surface rights in the United States (the  US Property ).  A significant historic gold mine is located on the US Property, which consists solely of private land.  Upon the execution of the option agreement, the Company paid the vendors a non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of USD$25,000, and an additional cash payment of US$2,000,000 is required to exercise the option.  On November 18, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the vendors to extend the closing date for the purchase of the US Property until December 26, 2016, in exchange for an additional non-refundable cash payment of US$25,000, which will be credited against the US$2,000,000 purchase price of the property upon the exercise of the purchase option. 
 The Company believes it can prepare a mineral resource estimate, exploration plan, and a preliminary mine plan through processing historic data on the US Property within two months of the closing of the purchase. 
 On October 6, 2016, the Company announced a non-brokered private placement of up to 17,500,000 units at a price of $0.20 per unit for gross proceeds of up to $3,500,000 (the  Private Placement ).  Each unit will consist of one share of the Company s common stock and one transferable share purchase warrant exercisable into one share of common stock at a price of $0.40 for a period of two years from the date of issuance.  The Company expects to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for the exercise of the option on the US Property, of which there is no guarantee, and for general working capital purposes. 
   
  Plan of Operations  
   
 As at October 31, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $10,319, compared to a cash balance of $139,021 as of July 31, 2016. 
   
 The Company s plan of operations for the next 12 months is to carry out the first of a two-phase exploration program on the Indata Property at a total cost of approximately $304,605, as follows: 
   
  Phase I: Line Cutting, Mapping, Geophysical and Geochemical Surveys  

4 

The first phase combines line cutting, soil sampling and geophysics work to provide the information needed to determine drill targets, if any, for the second phase and will achieve the exploration budget for the next 12 months required by the Option Agreement.  The Company expects to complete the second phase of the exploration program by November 30, 2017, as follows: 
   
  Phase II: Drilling Program  

The Company is currently evaluating the seven southeast British Columbia properties that it purchased from Klondike.  An exploration program will be compiled based on the findings from this evaluation.  The Company is also undertaking a due diligence process on the US Property that it has under option, and evaluating whether to proceed with the purchase of that property. 
   
 In addition to the two phase program and future work on the southeast British Columbia properties, the Company anticipates spending approximately $291,500 on general operating expenses, including fees payable in connection with its filing obligations as a reporting issuer in both the United States and Canada, as follows: 

The Company does not currently have sufficient funds to carry out the two-phase exploration program or cover its anticipated general operating expenses for the year, so it will require additional funding. The Company anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of its common stock or from loans from one of several directors or officers, or companies controlled by directors or officers.  The Company does not have  

5 

any arrangements in place for any future equity financing or loans, and if the Company is not successful in raising additional financing, the Company anticipates that it will not be able to proceed with its business plan. 
   
 The Company anticipates incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. It bases this expectation, in part, on the fact that very few mineral claims in the exploration stage ultimately develop into producing, profitable mines. The Company s future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside its control. These factors include the following: 

its ability to raise additional funding; 
   
 the market price for any minerals that may be discovered on the Indata Property; 
   
 the results of its proposed exploration program on the Indata Property. 
   
 The Company has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue its proposed exploration activities. For these reasons the Company s auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that it will be able to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  For the Periods Ended October 31, 2016 and 2015  
   
 The Company s operating results for the periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

The Company s operating expenses increased during the period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of increased costs for consulting, filing and regulatory, professional fees and promotion and shareholder communications, driven by the new listing on the CSE in February 2016 and increases in consulting and expenses related to planning and researching the Company s mineral properties.   
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
  Working Capital

Cash Flows  

As of July 31, 2016, the Company had $10,319 in cash, $60,258 in current assets, $656,047 in total assets, $215,874 in current and total liabilities, a working capital deficit of $155,616 and an accumulated deficit of $2,134,121. 
   
 During the period ended October 31, 2016, the Company used $162,744 in net cash on operating activities, whereas it used $14,833 in net cash on operating activities during the prior period.  The difference in net cash used in operating activities during the two periods was largely due to the increase in the Company s net loss for the most recent year, as adjusted for the accrual of a larger accounts payable, accrued liabilities and due to related parties balance. 
   
 During the period ended October 31, 2016, the Company used net cash of $32,758 (2015 - $Nil) from investing activities. In the current year, the Company paid $32,758 (US$25,000) as a deposit on the US Property acquisition. 
   
 The Company received net cash of $66,800 from financing activities during the period ended October 31, 2016 (2015 - $Nil) from subscriptions received in advance. 
   
 The Company expects to operate at a loss for at least the next 12 months. It has no agreements for additional financing and cannot provide any assurance that additional funding will be available to finance its operations on acceptable terms in order to enable it to carry out its business plan. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to complete further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing. If the Company is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then it will not be able to carry out any exploration work on the Indata Property or the other properties in which it owns an interest and its business may fail. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
  ITEM 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  
   
 Not applicable. 
   
  ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) defines the term  disclosure controls and procedures  to mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all  

7 

information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2016 because the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date: 
   
 (i) 
 lack of segregation of incompatible duties due to insufficient personnel. 
   
 A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the period ended October 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1.   
  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  
   
 On September 17, 2014, the Company learned that it was the subject, along with a number of additional defendants, of a notice of civil claim (the  Claim ) filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by Wundr Software Inc. ( Wundr ), an eBook software developer. Wundr and the Company were formerly parties to a binding letter of intent that was announced on November 12, 2013 (the  Wundr LOI ), pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Wundr. On January 10, 2014, the Company reported that the Wundr LOI had expired. 
   
 Among other things, the Claim alleges that the Company committed the tort of intentional interference with economic or contractual relations by virtue of its role in an alleged scheme to establish a competing business to Wundr, and that the Company, through its agents, breached the terms of the Wundr LOI by appropriating certain confidential information and intellectual property of Wundr for the purpose of establishing a competing business.  The Claim also alleges that the Company is vicariously liable for the actions of its agents. 
   
 Wundr is seeking general damages from the Company as well as damages for conspiracy to cause economic harm.  None of the allegations contained in the Claim have been proven in court, the Company believes that they are without merit, and it therefore intends to vigorously defend its position against Wundr.  
   
 Other than as described above, the Company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which it is a party or of which its property is the subject. The Company also knows of no proceedings to which any of its directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial holders of more than 5% of any class of the Company s securities, or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate or security holder are an adverse party or have a material interest adverse to the Company.

  ITEM 2.  
  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.  
   
 On August 1, 2016, the Company issued 400,000 shares of common stock to its Chief Executive Officer, Benjamin Mossman, at a deemed price of $0.15 per share as a signing bonus pursuant to Mr. Mossman s executive employment agreement.  On August 9, 2016, and pursuant to the same agreement, the Company issued Mr. Mossman options to purchase 586,600 shares of the Company s common stock exercisable at a price of $0.20 per share until August 8, 2021. 
   
 The Company issued the foregoing shares and granted the foregoing options in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Regulation S ).  The Company s reliance on Rule 903 of Regulation S was based on the fact that the shares and options were issued/granted in  offshore transactions , as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S.  The Company did not engage in any directed selling efforts in the United States in connection with the issuance/grant, and Mr. Mossman is not a U.S. person and did not acquire the shares/options for the account or benefit of any U.S. person.  
   
 Other than as described above, during the period ended October 31, 2016 the Company did not issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
