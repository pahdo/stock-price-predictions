  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
           1. 
    ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE FUND 
     Venture Lending   Leasing VIII, Inc. (the  Fund ), was incorporated in Maryland on May 6, 2015 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company electing status as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and is managed by Westech Investment Advisors, LLC, ( Manager  or  Management ).  The Fund will be dissolved on December 31, 2025 unless an election is made to dissolve earlier by the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board").  One hundred percent of the stock of the Fund is held by Venture Lending   Leasing VIII, LLC (the  Company ).  Prior to commencing its operations on August 12, 2015, the Fund had no operations other than the sale to the Company of 100,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value for $25,000 in July 2015.  This issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply for a finance lender's license from the California Commissioner of Corporations, which was obtained on August 20, 2015.  
    
  The Fund's investment objective is to achieve a superior risk adjusted return.  In the Manager's opinion, the accompanying interim condensed financial statements (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations for interim periods.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted; however, the Fund believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The interim results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of what the results would be for a full year.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 
           2. 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     Basis of Accounting 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial information to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and money market mutual funds with maturities of 90 days or less.  Money market mutual funds held as cash equivalents are valued at their most recently traded net asset value. 
  Interest Income 
  Interest income on loans is recognized using the effective interest method including amounts from the amortization of discounts attributable to equity securities received as part of the loan transaction.  Additionally, fees received as part of the transaction are added to the loan discount and amortized over the life of the loan.  
    
  Valuation Procedures 
    
  The Fund accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the  Valuation Methods  below.  All valuations are determined under the direction of the Manager, in accordance with the Valuation Methods. 

7 

The Fund's loans are valued in connection with the issuance of its periodic financial statements, the issuance or repurchase of the Fund's shares at a price equivalent to the current net asset value per share, and at such other times as required by law.  On a quarterly basis, Management submits to the Board a "Valuation Report" and "Valuation Notes", which details the rationale for the valuation of investments. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the financial statements include nonmarketable investments of   $95.3 million   and   $26.2 million   (or approximately   86%   and   75%   of total assets), with fair values determined by the Manager in the absence of readily determinable market values.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations, estimated fair values of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.  Below is the information used by the Manager in making these estimates. 
    
  Loans 
    
  The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to lower a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  There is no secondary market for the loans made by the Fund to borrowers, hence Management determines fair value based on hypothetical markets.  Venture loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at estimated fair value.  The determination of fair value is based on a number of factors including the amount for which an investment could be exchanged in a current sale, which assumes an orderly disposition over a reasonable period other than in a forced sale.  Management also considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of the investments held by the Fund.  Management determines whether to adjust the estimated fair value of a loan based on a number of factors including but not limited to the borrower's payment history, available cash and  burn rate,  revenues, net income or loss, the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future, as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment.  The amount of any valuation adjustment considers liquidation analysis and is determined based upon a credit analysis of the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the borrower, including consideration of factors such as the nature and quality of the Fund's security interests in collateral, the estimated value of the Fund's collateral, the size of the loan, and the estimated time that will elapse before the Fund achieves a recovery.  Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral, increase in the estimated time to recovery,   and increase in the hypothetical market coupon rate     would have the effect of lowering the value of the current portfolio of loans. 
    
  Non-accrual Loans 
    
  The Fund's policy is to place a loan on non-accrual status when the portfolio company is delinquent for three months on its monthly loan payment, or ceases or drastically curtails its operation and Management deems that it is unlikely that the loan will return to performing status.  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed for the quarter in which the loan was placed on non-accrual status.  Any uncollected interest related to quarters prior to when the loan was placed on non-accrual status is added to the principal balance, and the aggregate balance of the principal and interest is evaluated in accordance with the policy for valuation of loans in determining Management's best estimate of fair value.  Interest received by the Fund on non-accrual loans will be recognized as interest income if and when the proceeds exceed the book value of the loans. 
  If a borrower of a non-accrual loan resumes making regular payments and is  deemed by Management to have the ability to service the loan on a sustainable basis,   the loan is reclassified back to accrual or performing status.  Interest that would have been accrued during the non-accrual status will be added back to the remaining payment schedule, and thus changing the effective interest rate.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , loans with a cost basis of   $2.8 million   and a fair value of   $0.7 million   have been classified as non-accrual. No loans were classified as non-accrual as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  
    8 

Warrants  
    
  Warrants that are received in connection with loan transactions generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of acquisition.  These securities are then distributed by the Fund to its shareholder at the assigned value.  Warrants are valued based on a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into account factors underlying stock value, expected term, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate, among other factors.   
  Underlying asset value is estimated based on information available, including information regarding recent rounds of funding of the portfolio company, or the publicly-quoted stock price at the end of the financial reporting period for warrants for comparable publicly-quoted securities.   
  Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price, is based on an index of publicly traded companies grouped by industry and which are similar in nature to the underlying portfolio companies issuing the warrant ( Industry Index ).  The volatility assumption for each Industry Index is based on the average volatility for individual public companies within the portfolio company's industry for a period of time approximating the expected life of the warrants.  A hypothetical increase in the volatility of the warrants used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
  The remaining expected lives of warrants are based on historical experience of the average life of the warrants, as warrants are often exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers, or initial public offerings and terminated due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities, or additional financings.  These events cause the expected term to be less than the remaining contractual term of the warrants.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30, 2015, the Fund assumed the average duration of a warrant is 3.5 years. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated initial term of the warrants used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
  The risk-free interest rate is derived from the constant maturity tables issued by the U.S. Treasury Department.  The effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated risk-free rate used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
  The Fund engages an independent valuation company to provide valuation assistance including the evaluations of the Fund's valuation methodology and the reasonableness of the assumptions used from the perspective of a market participant.  They calculate several of the inputs used such as volatility and risk-free rate.  Upon the receipt of such data from the valuation company, a sample test is performed to ensure the accuracy of their calculations and that the source of data is reliable and consistent with the way in which the calculations were made in prior periods.  Such inputs are entered into the database with a second review to ensure the accuracy of the input information.  All calculations of warrant values are performed by one employee and reviewed by a second employee.  The inputs of the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model are reevaluated every quarter.  
  Other Assets and Liabilities 
  Other Assets include costs incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the Fund's debt facility and are stated at initial cost.  The costs are amortized over the term of the facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of Other Assets and Liabilities are estimated at their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these assets or liabilities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , based on borrowing rates available to the Fund, the estimated fair values of the borrowings under the debt facility were   $44.0 million   and   $0  , respectively. 

9 

Commitment Fees 
  Unearned income and commitment fees on loans are recognized as additional interest on loans using the effective interest method over the term of the loan.  Commitment fees are carried as liabilities when received for commitments upon which no draws have been made.  When the first draw is made, the fee is treated as unearned income and is recognized as described above.  If a draw is never made, the forfeited commitment fee less any applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the commitment expires. 
    
  Deferred Bank Fees 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the deferred bank fees and costs associated with the debt facility have been capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated life of the facility, which currently is through April 5, 2019.  The deferred bank fees are included in Other Assets in the Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities.The amortization of these costs is recorded as interest expense in the Condensed Statements of Operations (see Note 7). 
    
  Interest Rate Cap Agreements 
    
  The Fund has entered into interest rate cap agreements which are primarily valued on the basis of the future expected interest rates on the notional principal balance remaining, which is comparable to what a prospective acquirer would pay on the measurement date. Valuation pricing models consider inputs such as forward rates, anticipated interest rate volatility relating to the reference rate, as well as time value and other factors underlying cap instruments.  The contracts are recorded at fair value in interest rate caps in the Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities.  The changes in fair value are recorded in the Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations.  The quarterly interest received on the interest rate cap contracts, if any, will be recorded in Net change in realized gain (loss) from hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Since inception through   September 30, 2016  , there has been no interest received on interest rate cap contracts. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU")    2015-03 Interest-Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.  Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.  Debt issuance costs related to lines of credit and revolving debt facilities are not required to be deducted from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  The amended guidance is effective for the Fund s interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not significantly impact the Fund s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Tax Status 
    
  The Fund intends to be treated as a Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs.  Failing to maintain at least 70% of total assets in "qualifying assets" will result in the loss of BDC status, resulting in losing its favorable tax treatment as a RIC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund has met the BDC and RIC requirements.  
    
  In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Fund is required to distribute annually to its sole shareholder at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code.  To avoid federal excise taxes, the Fund must distribute annually at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of net capital gains from the current year and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding years.  The Fund, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income.  If the Fund chooses to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to the sole shareholder. The Fund will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required.  Below is a table summarizing the cost (on GAAP and tax basis) and the appreciation and depreciation of the investments reported on the Schedule of Investments in Note 3 below. 
  
    10 

As of September 30, 2016    

As of December 31, 2015    

Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to paid-in-capital or accumulated net realized gain (loss), as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise.  Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses.  These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Fund's annual RIC tax return. 
    
  Book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified among the Fund's capital accounts.  In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. 
       
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no undistributed earnings.  Additionally, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , distributions were made in excess of distributable earnings by   $5.2 million  .  The Fund may pay distributions in excess of its taxable net investment income.  This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the shareholder's tax basis in its shares.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no uncertain tax positions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no capital loss carry forwards.  
    
  The Fund's tax years are open to examination by federal tax authorities and California tax authorities for the years 2015 and forward.  
    
           3.

* As of   September 30, 2016  , loans with a cost basis of   $2.8 million   and a fair value   $0.7 million   of have been classified as non-accrual. 
    
  ** Indicates assets that the Fund deems  non-qualifying assets  under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets 
  must represent at least 70% of the Fund s total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. As of    September 30, 2016  ,   6.06%   of the Fund s assets represented non-qualifying assets. As part of this calculation, the denominator consists of all eligible portfolio companies as defined in Section 2(a)(46); the numerator consists of total assets less the assets described in Section 55(a)(7).

As of   December 31, 2015  , all loans were made to non-affiliates as follows: 

15 

As of   December 31, 2015  , no loans were classified as non-accrual and as non-qualifying assets. 
  4.    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
  Loans generally are made to borrowers pursuant to commitments whereby the Fund agrees to finance assets and provide working capital or growth up to a specified amount for the term of the commitment, upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified by such commitment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund's investments in loans were primarily to companies based within the United States and were diversified among borrowers in the industry segments shown below.  The percentage of net assets that each industry group represents is shown with the industry totals below  (the sum of the percentages does not equal 100 percent because the percentages are based on net assets as opposed to total loans). All loans are senior to unsecured creditors.  
    
  The Fund provides asset-based financing primarily to start-up and emerging growth venture-capital-backed companies. These loans are generally secured by assets of the borrowers.  As a result, the Fund is generally subject to general credit risk associated with such companies.  
    
  The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price.  The exit price assumes the asset or liability was exchanged in an orderly transaction; it was not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. 
    
  Loan balances are summarized by borrower.  Typically a borrower's balance will be composed of several loans drawn under a commitment made by the Fund with the interest rate on each loan fixed at the time each loan is funded.  Each loan drawn under a commitment may have a different maturity date and amount.  For the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate on performing loans was    15.17%   and   15.62%  , respectively. For the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30,2015, the weighted-average interest rate on performing loans was   17.09%  . This rate is inclusive of both cash and non-cash interest income.  For the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate on the cash portion of the interest income was   11.73%   and   11.98%  , respectively. For the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30,2015, the weighted-average interest rate on the cash portion of the interest income was   12.36%  .  Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many factors including early payoffs, volatility of values ascribed to warrants and new loans funded during the period.  
    
  The risk profile of a loan changes when events occur that impact the credit analysis of the borrower and loan as described in our loan accounting policy. Such changes result in the fair value adjustments made to the individual loans. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, which is primarily the case for this loan portfolio, the par value of the loan will approximate fair value. 
    
  All loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were pledged as collateral for the debt facility, and the Fund's borrowings are subsequently collateralized by all assets of the Fund. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Fund had unexpired unfunded commitments to borrowers of   $40.3 million   and   $17.7 million  , respectively.

Valuation Hierarchy  
  Under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10 Fair Value Measurements, the Fund categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy.  The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the Fund's valuation techniques.  A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: 
    
                   Level 1 
      
    Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
      Level 2 
      
    Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
      Level 3 
      
    Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Transfers of investments between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recorded on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.  There were no transfers in and out of Level 1, 2, and 3 during the period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Fund's cash equivalents were valued at the traded net asset value of the money market mutual fund.  As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 1.The Fund s investments in the interest rate cap are based on quotes from the market makers that derive fair values from market data, and therefore, are classified as Level 2. 
  The Fund uses estimated exit values when determining the value of its investments.  Because loan transactions are individually negotiated and unique, and there is no market in which these assets trade, the inputs for these assets, which are discussed in the Valuation Methods listed above, are classified as Level 3.   
    
  The following tables provide quantitative information about the Fund's Level 3 fair value measurements of its investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, the Fund may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining its fair value measurements.

5. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
     Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net increase  (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of potential common shares (e.g., stock options).  The Fund held no instruments that would be potential common shares; thus, reported basic and diluted earnings per share are the same. 
           6. 
    CAPITAL STOCK 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock authorized, and 100,000 shares issued and outstanding.  Total committed capital of the Company, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $423.6   million respectively. Total contributed capital to the Company through   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $95.3   million and   $42.4   million, of which   $77.9 million   and   $38.0 million   was contributed to the Fund, respectively.   
    
  The chart below shows the distributions of the Fund for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  

* From August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through September 30, 2015. 
    
  Final classification of the distributions as either a return of capital or a distribution of income is an annual determination made at the end of each year dependent upon the Fund's current year and cumulative earnings and profits.

7.  DEBT FACILITY 
  On April 5, 2016, the Fund has established a secured, syndicated revolving credit facility (the  Loan Agreement ) led by Wells Fargo, N.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. in an initial amount of up to $150,000,000.  An additional $200,000,000 is potentially available to the Fund, subject to further negotiation and credit approval, through an accordion provision contained in the Loan Agreement. Loans under the facility may be, at the option of the Fund, either a Reference Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan.  A Reference Rate Loan is defined as a loan bearing interest at the highest of: (a) the Federal Funds Rate for such day plus one half of one percent (0.50%), (b) the Prime Rate, and (c) LIBOR plus one percent (1%).  A LIBOR Rate Loan is defined as a Loan bearing interest at the prevailing LIBOR rate for a period equal to the applicable LIBOR Loan Period which appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or any applicable successor page) at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of the applicable LIBOR Loan Period (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) ("LIBOR Rate").  As of   September 30, 2016   , all of the Fund s outstanding borrowings were based on the LIBOR Rate. 
    
  The Fund will pay interest on its borrowings, and will also pay a fee on the unused portion of the facility. 
    
  The facility terminates on April 5, 2019, but can be accelerated in the event of default, such as failure by the Fund to make timely interest or principal payments.   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $44.0 million   and   $0   was outstanding under the facility, respectively. 
    
  Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by receivables under loans advanced by the Fund with assignment to the financial institution, plus all of other assets of the Fund.  Under the Loan Agreement, interest is charged to the Fund based on its borrowings at, the election of the Fund, an annual rate equal to either (i) LIBOR plus 2.75% or (ii) the Reference Rate plus 1.75%.  The Fund also pays an annual commitment fee under the Loan Agreement.  When the Fund is using 50% or more of the maximum amount available under the Loan Agreement, the applicable commitment fee is 0.25% of the unused portion of the loan facility; otherwise, the applicable commitment fee is 0.50% of the unused portion. The Fund pays the unused line fee quarterly. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the LIBOR Rate is as follows: 

Bank fees and other costs of $1.1 million were incurred in connection with the facility.  The bank fees and other costs incurred have been capitalized and are amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the expected life of the facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining unamortized fees and costs of   $0.8 million   are being amortized over the expected life of the facility, which is expected to terminate on April 5, 2019. 
    
  The facility is revolving and as such does not have a specified repayment schedule, although advances are secured by the assets of the Fund and thus repayments will be required as assets decline.  The facility contains various covenants including financial covenants related to: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio, (ii) interest coverage ratio, (iii) maximum loan loss reserves, (iv) unfunded commitment ratio, (v) Maximum Loan Loss Test and (vi) Covenant Deferral Condition.  There are also various restrictive covenants, including limitations on (i) the incurrence of liens, (ii) consolidations, mergers and asset sales, and (iii) capital expenditures.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Management believes that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants. 
  
    22 

The following is the summary of the outstanding facility draws as of   September 30, 2016  : 

* On October 17, 2016, Management rolled the outstanding amount for a 90-day LIBOR loan, maturing on  January 17, 2017. 
  ** Inclusive of 2.75% applicable LIBOR margin plus LIBOR rate. 
  8. INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Fund had entered into an interest rate cap transaction with Union Bank, N.A. with a notional principal amount of $22 million, to cap floating interest rates at 2.00%. The purpose of the interest rate cap agreement is to protect the Fund against rising interest rates, as the Fund originates loans with fixed interest rates. The Fund continues to adjust the notional principal amount as the outstanding balance under the debt facility changes. As of September 30, 2016, the Fund had one interest cap contract with the notional principal amount of $22 million. The Fund paid upfront fees of   $30,000   which are amortized on a straight  line basis over the life of the instrument and receives from the counterparty, payment of interest amounts above the 2.00% cap based on 90-day LIBOR. Payments, if necessary are made quarterly and will terminate on April 04, 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 90-days LIBOR rate was   0.8537%   . 
    
  The average notional amount outstanding was   $0.2 million   and less than   $0.1 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   respectively. There were no interest cap for the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30, 2015. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   , the fair value of the Fund's derivative financial instruments was as follows:

  9. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
    
  GAAP requires disclosure of financial highlights of the Fund for the periods presented,   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30, 2015. The total rate of return is defined as the return based on the change in value during the period of a theoretical investment made at the beginning of the period.  The total rate of return assumes a constant rate of return for the Fund during the period reported and weights each cash flow by the amount of time held in the Fund.  This required methodology differs from an internal rate of return. 
    
  The ratios of expenses and net investment income (loss) to average net assets, calculated below, are annualized and are computed based upon the aggregate weighted average net assets of the Fund for the periods presented.  Net investment income (loss) is inclusive of all investment income net of expenses, and excludes realized or unrealized gains and losses. 
    
  Beginning and ending net asset values per share are based on the beginning and ending number of shares outstanding. Other per share information is calculated based upon the aggregate weighted average net assets of the Fund for the periods presented. 

24 

The following per share data and ratios have been derived from the information provided in the financial statements:

Item 2.      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
    
  In addition to the historical information contained herein, the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the securities laws.  These forward-looking statements reflect the current view of the Fund with respect to future events and financial performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Fund's control.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this report, regarding the strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of the Fund are forward-looking statements.  When used in this report, the words  will ,  believe ,  anticipate ,  intend ,  estimate ,  expect ,  project  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report.  The Fund does not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
    
  The reader of this Quarterly Report should understand that all such forward-looking statements are subject to various uncertainties and risks that could affect their outcome.  The Fund's actual results could differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets, return on assets, loan losses, expenses, rates charged on loans and earned on securities investments,  competition and macro-economic changes including inflation, interest rate expectations, among other factors. This entire Quarterly Report should be read to put such forward-looking statements in context and to gain a more complete understanding of the uncertainties and risks involved in the Fund's business.  
    
  Overview 
    
  The Fund is 100% owned by the Company.  The Fund's shares of Common Stock, at $0.001 par value, were sold to its sole shareholder, the Company, under a stock purchase agreement.  The Fund has issued 100,000 of the Fund's 10,000,000 authorized shares.  The Company may make additional capital contributions to the Fund. 
    
  The Fund is a financial services company providing financing and advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venture-backed companies primarily throughout the United States with a focus on growth oriented companies.  The Fund's portfolio is expected to become more diversified and consists of companies in the communications, information services, media, and technology, including software and technology-enabled business services, bio-technology, and medical devices industry sectors, among others.  The Fund's capital is generally used by its portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets and working capital.  On August 12, 2015, the Company called and received its first capital, and the Fund started its investment activities. On August 31, 2015, the Fund completed its first closing of capital contributions. On September 1, 2015, the Fund made its first investments, and became a non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  As soon as the Fund is profitable, the Fund expects to elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code.  Pursuant to this election, the Fund generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income it distributes to the Company as dividends, allowing the Company to substantially reduce or eliminate its corporate-level tax liability.  
    
  The Fund, once the RIC election is made, will seek to meet the ongoing requirements, including the diversification requirements, to maintain its qualification and treatment as a RIC under the Code.  If the Fund fails to meet these requirements, it would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to the Company) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the Members of the Company as ordinary income; thus, such income will be subject to a double layer of tax.  There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the ongoing requirements to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes.  
    
  The Fund's investment objective is to achieve superior risk adjusted investment returns.  The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies.  Since inception, the Fund's investing activities have focused primarily on private debt securities.  The Fund generally receives warrants to acquire equity  
  
    26 

securities in connection with its portfolio investments.  The Fund generally distributes these warrants  to its shareholder upon receipt.  The Fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets which will be invested in different types of assets. 
    
  The portfolio investments of the Fund will primarily consist of debt financing to venture capital backed technology companies.  The borrower's ability to repay its loans may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, and as a result, the loan may not fully be repaid.  Furthermore, the Fund's security interest in any collateral over the borrower's assets may be insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments.  
    
   Transactions with Venture Lending   Leasing VII, Inc. ( Fund VII )   
    
  The Manager also serves as investment manager for Fund VII.  The Fund's Board determined that so long as Fund VII had capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than December 31, 2022 (the date on which Fund VII will be dissolved), the Fund would invest in each portfolio company in which Fund VII invested ( Investments ).  The amount of each Investment was allocated 50% to the Fund and 50% to Fund VII.  
    
  To the extent that clients, other than Fund VII, advised by the Manager (but in which the Manager has no proprietary interest) invest in opportunities available to the Fund, the Manager will allocate such opportunities among the Fund and such other clients in a manner deemed fair and equitable considering all of the circumstances in accordance with procedures approved by the Fund's Board (including a majority of the disinterested directors). 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Manager has identified the most critical accounting estimates upon which the financial statements depend and determined the critical accounting estimates by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.  The two critical accounting policies relate to the valuation of loans and treatment of non-accrual loans.   
    
  Loans are held at fair value as determined by Management, in accordance with the valuation methods described in the valuation of loans section of Note 2 to the financial statements (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).  Critical factors in determining the fair value of a loan include payment history, collateral position, financial strength of the borrower, prospects for the borrower's raising future equity rounds, likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower, and length of expected holding period of the loan, as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment.  The actual value of the loans may differ from Management's estimates, which would affect net change in net assets resulting from operations as well as assets.  
    
  Results of Operations -   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period ended September 30, 2015

The remaining income consisted of interest and dividends on the temporary investment of cash and forfeited commitment fees and warrants.  The income was primarily driven by the level of average loans outstanding for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through September 30, 2015 of    $87.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively.

Until August 11, 2017, management fees will be calculated as 2.5 percent of the committed capital of the Company.  Starting on August 12, 2017, management fees will be calculated as 2.5 percent of the Fund's total assets.

Committed capital to the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $423.6   million, of which   $95.3   million and   $42.4   million had been called as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The remaining   $328.3   million of committed capital outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   is due to expire in December 2020 as the five year anniversary will have passed, at which time no further capital can be called.  
    
  On April 5, 2016, the Fund has established a secured, syndicated revolving credit facility (the  Loan Agreement ) led by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. in an initial amount of up to $150,000,000.    Borrowings by the Fund are collateralized by all of the assets of the Fund.  Loans under the facility may be, at the option of the Fund, either a Reference Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan.  The Fund will pay interest on its borrowings, and will also pay a fee on the unused portion of the facility.  
    
  The facility terminates on April 5, 2019, but can be accelerated in the event of default, such as failure by the Fund to make timely interest or principal payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,      $44.0 million   is outstanding under the facility. 
    
         As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   12.1%   and   23.9%  , respectively, of the Fund's assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Fund invested its assets in entirely in venture loans and disbursed under the Fund's loan commitments approximately   $77.8 million  .  Net loan amounts outstanding after amortization increased by approximately   $69.1 million   for the same period.  Unexpired, unfunded commitments totaled approximately   $40.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Because venture loans are privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are relatively illiquid.  It is the Fund's experience that not all unfunded commitments will be used by borrowers. 
    
  The Fund expects to elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code.  The Fund seeks to meet the requirements to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to its shareholder. To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must distribute to its shareholder for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (consisting generally of net investment income and net short-term capital gain) ( Distribution Requirement ).  To the extent that the terms of the Fund's venture loans provide for the receipt  
  
    29 

by the Fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term or provide for the receipt by the Fund of a purchase price for the asset at the end of the loan term ( residual income ), the Fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan, and to include such accrued undistributed income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year.  Thus, in order to meet the Distribution Requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or an excise tax on undistributed income, the Fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives.  Those distributions will be made from the Fund's cash assets, from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund has adequate cash reserves and approximately   $33.6 million   in scheduled receivable payments over the next year.  Additionally the Fund has access to uncalled capital of   $328.3   million as a liquidity source and the unused portion of the revolving credit facility.  These amounts are sufficient to meet the current commitment backlog and operational expenses of the next year.  The Fund constantly evaluates potential future liquidity resources and demands before making additional future commitments.  
    
  Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The Fund's business activities contain elements of risk.  The Fund considers the principal types of market risk to be interest rate risk and credit risk.  The Fund considers the management of risk essential to conducting its business and to maintaining profitability.  Accordingly, the Fund's risk management procedures are designed to identify and analyze the Fund's risks, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs.   
    
  The Fund manages its market risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diverse by industry, size of investment, stage of development, and borrower.  The Fund has limited exposure to public market price fluctuations as the Fund primarily invests in private business enterprises and the Fund generally distributes all equity securities upon receipt to the Company. 
    
  The Fund's investments are subject to market risk based on several factors, including, but not limited to, the borrower's credit history, available cash, support of the borrower's underlying investors, available liquidity, "burn rate", revenue income, security interest, secondary markets for collateral, the size of the loan, and term of the loan, and the ability to exit via Initial Public Offering or Merger and Acquisition. 
    
  The Fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates is regularly monitored and analyzed by measuring the characteristics of assets and liabilities.  The Fund utilizes various methods to assess interest rate risk in terms of the potential effect on interest income net of interest expense, the value of net assets and the value at risk in an effort to ensure that the Fund is insulated from any significant adverse effects from changes in interest rates.  At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding debt balance was   $44.0 million   with interest expense based on a weighted average rate of   0.64%  , for which the Fund had an interest rate cap in place at   2.00%   on   $22.0 million   of outstanding debt, interest rate sensitivity of this   $22.0 million   at   1.36%  , which   the Manager does not believe is material to the finance statement. Additionally, the fund  has no interest rate protection for the remaining   $22.0 million   uncapped portion. 
  Because all of the Fund s loans have a fixed interest rate upon funding, changes in interest rates will not directly affect interest income with regard to the portfolio of loans as of   September 30, 2016  , but could potentially change the Fund s ability to originate loan commitments, acquire and renew bank facilities, and engage in other investment activities.  Changes in interest rates also could affect interest rate expense, realized gain from hedging and interest on the Fund s short-term investments.   
  Based on the Fund s Condensed Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   , the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in investments, borrowings, cash balances, and interest rate hedges.  

30 

Additionally, a change in the interest rate may affect the value of the interest rate cap and effect Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) from hedging activities.  The amount of any such effect will be contingent upon market expectations for future interest rate changes.  Any increases in expected future rates will increase the value of the interest rate cap while any rate decreases will decrease the value. 
  Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of the Fund s sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not take into consideration potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in the portfolio. It also does not assume any new fundings to borrowers, repayments from borrowers or defaults on borrowings.  Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the table above.   
  Because the Fund currently borrows, and plans to borrow in the future, its net investment income is to a great extent dependent upon the difference between the rate at which it borrows and the rate at which it invests the amounts borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund s investment activities and net investment income. The Fund attempts to limit its interest rate risk by acquiring interest rate caps, and anticipates that future borrowings will cause the Fund to choose to hedge its interest rate exposure.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

Based upon this evaluation, the Fund's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Fund's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them of any material information relating to the Fund that is required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls: 
    
  There were no changes in the Fund's internal controls or in other factors that could materially affect these controls during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

PART II       OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1.      Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Fund may become party to certain lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business.  While the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, the Fund does not expect any such proceedings will have a material effect upon the Fund's financial condition or results of operation. Management is not aware of any pending legal proceedings involving the Fund.
