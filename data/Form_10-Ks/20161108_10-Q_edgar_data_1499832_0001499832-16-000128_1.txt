  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued  Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02,   Leases.    ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments, and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The liability and asset are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.  The ASU applies to all leases, including those previously classified as operating leases under ASC Topic 842.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and will require measurement of leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented, using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual reporting

Table of Contents     

periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-09 will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)  , which amends the principal-versus agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the Board s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09,   Revenue From Contracts With Customers  ). FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by stakeholders, including those related to (i) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s principal-versus-agent guidance and (ii) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s control principle. Among other things, the ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. As defined in the ASU, a specified good or service is "a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer." Therefore, for contracts involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-08 will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   which amends the guidance on identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation in the Board s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09,   Revenue From Contracts With Customers  ). The amendment adds the following guidance for identifying performance obligations (i) an entity is not required to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer and (ii) an entity is permitted, as an accounting policy election, to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the good rather than as an additional promised service. The amendment also adds the following guidance on licensing implementation by clarifying (i) an entity's promise to grant a customer a license to intellectual property that has significant standalone functionality does not include supporting or maintaining that intellectual property during the license period , (ii) an entity s promise to grant a customer a license to symbolic intellectual property includes supporting or maintaining that intellectual property during the license period and (iii) an entity considers the nature of its promise in granting a license, regardless of whether the license is distinct. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-10 will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which amends only the narrow aspects in the Board s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09,   Revenue From Contracts With Customers  ). The amendments in this update include (i) clarifying the objective of collectibility, (ii) allows an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price, (iii) clarifies the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, (iv) provides a practical expedient which permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (v) clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") before the date of initial application and (vi) clarifies that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-12 will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The retrospective transition method, requiring adjustment to all comparative periods presented, is required unless it is impracticable for some of the amendments, in which case those amendments would be prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within

those annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2016-15 will have on its financial statements. 

3. Interim Financial Data 
    
    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with all significant intercompany balances and transactions eliminated in consolidation.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for and financial condition as of the end of the interim periods have been included.  The results of operations and cash flows for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the Company s financial condition as of such date are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows that can be expected for, or the Company s financial condition as of, any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   is derived from the audited financial statements at that date.         
    
  Our net revenue varies throughout the year. We expect that our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest net revenue for the year, as advertising expenditures generally decline following the winter holidays, and the second and third calendar quarters will generally produce the highest net revenue for the year. During even-numbered years, net revenue generally includes increased advertising expenditures by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. Political spending is typically highest during the fourth quarter. In addition to advertising revenue seasonality, our Entertainment net revenue exhibits seasonality resulting in the third quarter being the highest revenue period, followed by the second, then fourth, then first quarter. Large drivers of this seasonality are our summertime multi-day music festivals and NAME's revenue which is concentrated in the third quarter. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on net revenue generation until future periods, if at all. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its significant estimates, including those related to bad debts, intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual amounts and results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

4. Significant Acquisitions 
    
    NAME Acquisition  : On September 1, 2015, the Company, through a subsidiary of Townsquare Live Events, LLC, purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Heartland Group, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary NAME for approximately   $70.0 million   in cash,   481,948   unregistered shares of the Company's Class A common stock valued at   $4.9 million  , and a working capital adjustment of   $0.4 million  .  Cash consideration was satisfied from cash on hand,   $45.0 million   of incremental term loan borrowings and a working capital adjustment of approximately   $0.4 million  .  The Company estimated the fair value of acquired intangibles using the discounted cash flow method. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at their fair value at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being reported as goodwill. The Company expects none of this goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.  The Company has recognized an opening deferred tax liability in connection with the acquisition of NAME, as the initial tax basis of the acquired assets differ from their initial basis under GAAP, which reflects estimated fair market value.

     Table of Contents     

The NAME purchase price allocation is shown in the following table.  

5. Investments           
  Long-term investments consist of minority holdings in companies that management believes are synergistic with Townsquare. Management does not exercise significant control over operating and financial policies of the investees, accordingly the investments are reflected under the cost method of accounting. The initial equity valuations were based upon a discounted cash flows analysis, using unobservable inputs categorized as Level 3 within the Accounting Standards Codification Section 820 framework.  
    
  The Company determined there was objective evidence to indicate certain events have adversely impacted estimated future cash flows for one of its investments and as a result recorded a   $4.2 million   impairment charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company made a   $3.5 million   investment in an online services business.  The investment represents a minority ownership position and is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and is recorded as an investment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

6. Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment consisted of the following: 

Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was   $3.9 million   and   $4.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively and   $10.0 million   and   $14.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

10 

In September 2015, the Company closed on the sale of   43   towers located on   41   sites in   28   markets to a subsidiary of Vertical Bridge, LLC ("Vertical Bridge") (the "Tower Sale").  The divested towers house antenna that broadcast certain of the Company s radio stations.  The Company also entered into an agreement with Vertical Bridge whereby Vertical Bridge will serve as the exclusive marketing agent for the   282   towers retained by the Company.  The Company received total cash proceeds of   $21.6 million  , net of closing adjustments, in exchange for the sale of the towers and the exclusive marketing arrangement. In addition, the Company has leased a portion of the space on the sold towers that house certain of the Company's antenna. The lease is for a period of   35   years, including an initial term of   twenty   years and   three   optional   five  -year renewal periods.  The Company will pay   $41   of rent per annum (  $1   per site per annum) to Vertical Bridge for the right to house its existing antenna on the divested towers.  
    
  The Company has determined that the relative fair value of the towers sold and the exclusive marketing arrangement were   $25.8 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively. The following was recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in connection with this transaction with Vertical Bridge: 
                         ($ in thousands)

Other long term liabilities 
      Exclusive marketing arrangement

    3,111 

Other long term liabilities 

The Company realized an   $11.5 million   gain in connection with the sale of these towers during the third quarter of 2015, which was included in net gain on sale in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, the Company determined that the lease is an operating lease and is amortizing the long-term prepaid rent asset and deferred gain on the sale of towers as offsetting amounts over the lease term.  The exclusive marketing arrangement is being amortized through net revenue over the   five  -year term of the arrangement in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 

7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Indefinite-lived assets consist of FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill. FCC licenses represent a substantial portion of the Company s total assets. The FCC licenses are renewable in the ordinary course of business, generally for a maximum of   eight   years. The fair value of FCC licenses is primarily dependent on the future cash flows of the radio markets and other assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted revenue growth rates, profit margins and a risk-adjusted discount rate. 
    
  The Company has selected December 31st as the annual valuation date. Based on the results of the Company s 2015 annual impairment evaluations, the Company recorded impairment charges aggregating   $1.7 million   pertaining to FCC licenses in our Quad Cities and Grand Junction markets. All other fair values of the Company s intangibles exceeded their carrying value, therefore, no impairment of these assets had occurred as of the date of the annual tests. If market conditions and operational performance of the Company s reporting units were to deteriorate and management had no expectation that the performance would improve within a reasonable period of time or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet, the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. 
    
  There were   no   changes to goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents     

Intangible assets consist of the following:   

Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively and   $2.1 million   and   $3.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
    
  Estimated future amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows:

8. Long-Term Debt 
  Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

On April 1, 2015, the Company issued   $300.0 million   of   6.5%   Unsecured Senior Notes due in 2023 (the "2023 Notes") and a Senior Secured Credit Facility, which includes a   seven   year,   $275.0 million   term loan facility (the "Term Loans") and a   five   year,   $50.0 million   revolving credit facility (the "Revolver").  Borrowings are guaranteed by each of the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries, and subject to certain exceptions, are secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The proceeds from the 2023 Notes and Term Loans were used to redeem the   9%   Unsecured Senior Notes due 2019 issued by the Company's wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary Townsquare Radio, LLC ("Townsquare Radio") together with Townsquare Radio, Inc., as co-borrowers (the "2019 Notes"), and repay all outstanding borrowings under Townsquare Radio's previously existing Senior Secured Credit Facility (the "Incremental Term Loans"), including a   $10.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility.  The Company paid   $27.7 million   in redemption premiums to holders of the 2019 Notes in connection with the redemption. In addition, the Company had a loss of   $9.1 million   and a gain of   $6.8 million   on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and bond premium, respectively in connection with these repayments. The payment to holders of the 2019 Notes and the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs and bond premium are included in cancellation and (repurchase) of debt in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  On September 1, 2015, the Company issued incremental term loans of   $45.0 million   under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the proceeds of which were used to partially fund the purchase price of NAME.  Further, on September 30, 2015, the Company made a   $20.0 million   voluntary prepayment of borrowings under the Term Loans. The Company recognized a loss of   $0.3 million   on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with this voluntary prepayment in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  On March 24, 2016, the Company voluntarily repurchased   $0.7 million   of its 2023 Notes at a market price below par, plus accrued interest.  The repurchased notes were canceled by the Company.  A gain of   $34 thousand   is included in other expense (income), net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company voluntarily repurchased an aggregate of   $17.2 million   of the Company's 2023 Notes at market prices below par, plus accrued interest.  The repurchased notes were canceled by the Company.  A gain of   $0.4 million   is included in other expense (income), net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recognized a loss of   $0.3 million   on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the voluntary repurchases on its 2023 Notes, which is included in interest expense, net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loans continued to bear interest at an initial interest rate of   4.25%   (based on current LIBOR levels, a   1.00%   LIBOR floor and an applicable margin of   325   basis points).  The Revolver has an interest rate based either on LIBOR and an applicable margin of   250   basis points, or an alternative base rate and an

applicable margin of   150   basis points. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the Revolver. 
    
  The 2023 Notes mature on April 1, 2023, with interest payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Prior to maturity, the Company may redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes at specified redemption premiums as set forth in the indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Additionally, if the Company experiences certain change of control events, holders of the 2023 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their notes at   101%   of the principal amount thereof. 
    
  The 2023 Notes rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior debt, are senior to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated debt, and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of the Company s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
    
  The 2023 Notes indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; create liens; create restrictions on the Company s subsidiaries  ability to make payments to the Company; pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of the Company s and its subsidiaries  capital stock; make certain investments or certain other restricted payments; guarantee indebtedness; designate unrestricted subsidiaries; sell certain kinds of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and effect mergers and consolidations. 
    
  The Term Loans mature on April 1, 2022, and the Revolver matures on April 1, 2020. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are subject to mandatory prepayments equal to the net proceeds to the Company of any additional debt issuances or asset sales, as well as half of annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement (subject to certain reductions). Borrowings are guaranteed by each of the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries, and subject to certain exceptions, are secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
       
  The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens; engage in mergers or other fundamental changes; sell certain property or assets; pay dividends or other distributions; make acquisitions, investments, loans and advances; prepay certain indebtedness including the 2023 Notes; change the nature of its business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates and incur restrictions on interactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, or limit actions in relation to the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

9. Stockholders' Equity 
    
  The table below presents a summary, as of September 30, 2016, of our authorized and outstanding common stock, and securities convertible into common stock, excluding options issued under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan.   

  The foregoing share totals exclude   4,070,239   of Class A common stock and   4,511,236   of Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, which options have an exercise price of between   $8.96   and   $13.02   per share.  Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue   50,000,000   shares of undesignated preferred stock. 
    
  On April 6, 2016, a warrant holder exercised   531,202   warrants in exchange for   531,197   shares of Class A common stock upon the holder exercising the warrants on a cashless basis.  
    
  On August 16, 2016, GE Capital Equity Holdings, LLC, GE Business Financial Services, Inc. and AN Capital Corporation (collectively, the  Selling Entities ), each existing stockholders of the Company, entered into a purchase agreement with Madison Square Garden Investments, LLC ( MSG ), pursuant to which MSG agreed to acquire a total of   3,208,139   shares of the Company s Class C common stock from the Selling Entities, which, in accordance with the terms of the Class C common stock, converted into a like number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock upon completion of the transaction (the  MSG Transaction ). In connection with the MSG Transaction, the Company entered into a registration agreement with MSG, dated as of August 16, 2016, which provides MSG, subject to certain customary limitations and other conditions, with the ability to cause the Company to register shares of Class A common stock held by MSG for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and grants MSG the right to participate in certain registrations by the Company of its equity securities. In addition, pursuant to a letter agreement, dated as August 16, 2016 (the  Board Observer Letter ), the Company has granted MSG the right to send   one   representative to observe meetings of the Company s Board of Directors and committees (the  Observer Rights ). MSG s Observer Rights will expire at such time as MSG holds less than   75%   of the number of shares of Class A common stock it held on the date of the Board Observer Letter. 
       
  Also on August 16, 2016, Steven Price, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors, entered into a purchase agreement with GE Capital Equity Holdings, LLC pursuant to which he agreed to acquire a total of   50,000   shares of Class C common stock from GE Capital Equity Holdings, LLC. In accordance with their terms, the shares of Class C common stock acquired by Mr. Price converted into shares of Class A common stock upon completion of the transaction. 
    
  The Company's common stock is not entitled to preemptive or other similar subscription rights to purchase any of our securities. Unless the Company's Board of Directors determines otherwise, we will issue all of our capital stock in uncertificated form.

Stock-based Compensation     
    
  The Company's 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2014 Incentive Plan") provides grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and other cash-based awards.  Directors, officers and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as others performing consulting or advisory services for the Company, are eligible for grants under the 2014 Incentive Plan.  The purpose of the 2014 Incentive Plan is to provide incentives that will attract, retain and motivate high performing officers, directors, employees and consultants by providing them with appropriate incentives and rewards either through a proprietary interest in our long-term success or compensation based on their performance in fulfilling their personal responsibilities. The aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2014 Incentive Plan or with respect to which awards may be granted may not exceed   12,000,000   shares.  As of September 30, 2016,   3,425,689   shares were available for grant. 
    
  The grant date fair value of the equity options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires estimates of the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the Company's common stock price, dividend yield and the risk-free rate.  The below table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the equity options granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

With the exception of the options that were granted to employees in the first quarter of 2016, the options provide for immediate vesting.  The options have an exercise price of between   $8.96   and   $13.02   per share. The expected term was calculated using the simplified method, defined as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of each award.  The expected volatility was based on market conditions of the Company and comparable companies. The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant which most closely corresponds to the expected term of the option.  The Company historically has not paid dividends and therefore did not utilize a dividend yield in the calculations. 
    
  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  :

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Of the   1,600,000   options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   1,565,000   were granted to employees and   35,000   were granted to directors of the Company. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted was $  2.38   and   $2.98   for options granted to employees and directors of the Company, respectively.  The options granted to directors provide for immediate vesting, whereas the options granted to employees have a   five  -year term with   50%   vesting in year three and   50%   vesting in year four.  For the three and nine months ended September 30,  2016, the Company recognized   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense with respect to the options granted.  As of September 30, 2016, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is   $2.7 million   to be recognized over   four   years. 
    
  There was no restricted stock activity during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015 or 2016. 
       
  The Company has issued stock to employees and independent directors. The shares are subject to a Selldown Agreement, pursuant to which FiveWire Media Ventures LLC ("FiveWire") (an entity formed for the purpose of investing in the Company by certain members of management, (the "FiveWire Holders")) are subject to certain restrictions on sales of the Company's common stock held by them. Pursuant to the terms of the Selldown Agreement, the FiveWire Holders and certain other members of management are generally restricted from transferring a specified percentage (which is expected to range between   50%   and   100%  ) of the shares of the Company's common stock held by them at the closing of the July 24, 2014 initial public offering (the "IPO"). If Oaktree sells a portion of the shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock that it holds (the percentage of shares and warrants, collectively, held by Oaktree at such time that it sells in such a transaction, referred to as the "Sale Percentage"), those subject to the Selldown Agreement will be permitted to sell a percentage of the shares of common stock and warrants held by them, up to an amount equal to the Sale Percentage.  The Selldown Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (i) the date that Oaktree no longer holds at least   10%   of the shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock, collectively, held by Oaktree immediately following closing of the IPO, and (ii) the third anniversary of the closing of the IPO. 

10. Income Taxes 
       
  The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30,   2015   and   2016   was approximately   41.3%   and   39.8%  , respectively. The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period, and can be influenced by many factors.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes to the statutory rates in the jurisdictions where the Company has operations and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of   35%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily relates to state, local and foreign income taxes.

    Operating Leases  :  The Company leases certain facilities and equipment used in its operations.  Certain of the Company s operating leases contain renewal options through 2062, escalating rent provisions and/or cost of living adjustments. Total rental expense was approximately   $5.9 million   and   $8.1 million   for the three months ended    September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, and   $14.7 million   and   $18.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Total rental expense includes costs incurred for live events such as venue and equipment rentals.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 

In January 2016, the Company signed a lease for office space in Charlotte, North Carolina, for use by its digital marketing solutions operation. The lease commenced on March 1, 2016, and has a   ten   year term. Initially   28,000   square feet has been leased, increasing to   51,288   square feet by year four. The annual minimum rental commitment aggregates   $0.3 million   at commencement of the lease, escalating to   $1.3 million   by year   ten  . 
    
  Other Commitments  : The radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is Nielsen Holdings N.V. ("Nielsen"), which publishes surveys for domestic radio markets. The Company s remaining aggregate obligation under the agreements with Nielsen as of    September 30, 2016   is approximately   $8.1 million   and is expected to be paid in accordance with the agreements through April 2019. 
    
  We  normally commit one or more years in advance to provide rides, games and concessions at certain fairs.  These agreements include an obligation to pay event fees, which may be expressed as a flat fee or as a percentage of revenues.  At   September 30, 2016  , our total minimum fee commitments for contracts with a remaining term in excess of one year are as follows:

13. Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company has   two   reportable segments, Local Marketing Solutions, which provides broadcast and digital products and solutions to advertisers and businesses within our local markets, and Entertainment, which provides live event experiences and music and lifestyle content directly to consumers, and promotion, advertising and product activations to local and national advertisers. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, the Company reported its results in   two   reportable segments, Local Advertising and Live Events, and reported the remainder of its business in its Other Media and Entertainment category.   The prior Local Advertising segment, together with the Company s digital marketing and e-commerce solutions, which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Local Marketing Solutions.  The Live Events segment, together with the Company s national digital assets which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Entertainment.  The Company redefined its reportable segments to more closely align with how its businesses have evolved over time, allocating its locally-focused products and services to the Local Marketing Solutions segment and its events and related production products and services to the Entertainment segment.  This reflects how management currently reviews the Company s performance and assesses the allocation of resources.  The new segment presentation has been applied retrospectively to the Company's segment financial information but did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with an overall understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and sources and uses of cash. This section also includes general information about our business and a discussion of our management s analysis of certain trends, risks and opportunities in our industry. In addition, we also provide a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates as well as discuss certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in this quarterly report.  

Note About Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results that are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.  Forward-looking statements often discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as  aim,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   outlook,   potential,   project,   projection,   plan,   intend,   seek,   believe,   may,   could,   would,   will,   should,   can,   can have,   likely,  the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.  Actual events or results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us include the impact of general economic conditions, industry conditions, including existing competition and future competitive technologies, the popularity of radio as a broadcasting and advertising medium, cancellations, disruptions or postponements of advertising schedules in response to national or world events, our dependence on key personnel, our capital expenditure requirements, our continued ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, and consummate and integrate any future acquisitions, legislative or regulatory requirements, and other factors mentioned in this section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this report and under  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.  Many of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
   
  Format of Presentation 
    
  Townsquare is a media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company, principally focused on small and mid-sized markets across the United States. Our assets include market leading radio stations, live events, and digital, mobile, video and social media properties. Our integrated and diversified product and service offerings, which we refer to as   Townsquare Everywhere  , enable local, regional and national advertisers to target audience engagement across multiple platforms, including on-air, online and at live events. We believe our   Townsquare Everywhere   capabilities, combined with our leading market position in small and mid-sized markets, enable us to generate higher total net revenue per audience member than radio station owners focused on larger markets. 
    
  Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. We have two reportable segments, Local Marketing Solutions, which provides broadcast and digital products and solutions to advertisers and businesses within our local markets, and Entertainment, which provides live event experiences and music and lifestyle content directly  
  
   22 

to consumers, and promotion, advertising and product activations to local and national advertisers. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, we reported our results in two reportable segments, Local Advertising and Live Events, and reported the remainder of our business in our Other Media and Entertainment category.   The prior Local Advertising segment, together with our digital marketing and e-commerce solutions, which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Local Marketing Solutions.  The prior Live Events segment, together with the our national digital assets which were previously part of the Other Media and Entertainment category, are now reported within Entertainment.  We redefined our reportable segments to more closely align with how our businesses have evolved over time, allocating our locally-focused products and services to our Local Marketing Solutions segment and our events and related production products and services to the Entertainment segment.  This reflects how management currently reviews our performance and assesses the allocation of resources.  The new segment presentation has been applied retrospectively to our segment financial information but did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Local Marketing Solutions 
    
  Our Local Marketing Solutions segment is composed of   309   owned and operated radio stations and over   325   owned and operated local websites serving   66   small and mid-sized markets, a digital marketing solutions offering and an e-commerce offering.  Almost all of our radio stations have local companion websites that utilize the station brands and are populated with proprietary, original content created or curated by our local media personalities.    
    
  Our primary source of Local Marketing Solutions net revenue is the sale of advertising and sponsorship on our radio stations, local companion websites, radio stations  online streams and mobile applications. Our sales of advertisements and sponsorship are primarily affected by the demand for advertising from local, regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates we charge. Advertising demand and rates are based primarily on our ability to attract audiences to our various products in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, as measured principally by various services on a periodic basis. We endeavor to develop strong audience loyalty and believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations and websites helps to insulate our radio stations and websites from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format. We believe that the sale of our online and mobile advertisements, which currently have rates per advertisement that are less than those of terrestrial radio advertisements, has not negatively impacted our terrestrial radio advertising net revenue. Should a significant and sudden shift in demand for these products toward online and mobile occur, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to increase rates accordingly. We believe that as a result of our strong brands and quality online and mobile offerings we are well positioned to increase rates as demand increases for these products. 
       
  Within our Local Marketing Solutions segment we offer digital marketing solutions, on a subscription basis, to small and mid-sized local and regional businesses ("SMBs") in small and mid-sized markets across the United States, including the markets in which we operate radio stations.  Our digital marketing solutions, offered under the brand name Townsquare Interactive, include traditional and mobile-enabled website development and hosting services, search engine and online directory optimization services, online reputation management and social media management. 
    
  We strive to maximize Local Marketing Solutions net revenue by managing our advertising inventory time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand and by broadening our base of advertisers and subscribers. Our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our advertising inventory and, in general, we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory levels. The optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the platform and in the case of our radio stations and their online streams, the programming format of a particular radio station. Each of our advertising products has a general target level of available inventory. We seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our platforms, thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group. 
    
  Our Local Marketing Solutions contracts are generally short-term. In the media industry, companies sometimes utilize barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging, instead of cash. Barter revenue was $4.4 million and $6.8 million and barter expense was $3.7 million and $3.8 million for the three  
  
   23 

months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively. Barter revenue was   $11.4 million   and   $17.4 million   and barter expense was   $10.1 million   and   $10.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively.  The majority of barter revenue and expense falls within our Local Marketing Solutions segment. 
    
  Other sources of revenue within our Local Marketing Solutions segment include tower and other miscellaneous revenue.  We generate revenue from leasing space on our own tower facilities sold generally to communications companies and local authorities, as well as from other miscellaneous revenue sources.  As a result of the September 1, 2015 sale of 43 towers (see Note 6 of the Notes to unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements), tower lease revenue is no longer a significant contributor to other revenue. 
    
  Our most significant Local Marketing Solutions expenses are sales, programming, digital, marketing and promotional, engineering and general and administrative expenses. We strive to control these expenses by closely monitoring and managing each of our local markets and through efficiencies gained from the centralization of finance, accounting, legal and human resources functions and management information systems. We also use our scale and diversified geographic portfolio to negotiate favorable rates with vendors, where feasible. 
    
  A portion of our Local Marketing Solutions expenses are variable. These variable expenses primarily relate to sales costs, such as commissions as well as certain programming costs, such as music license fees. Other programming, digital, engineering and general and administrative expenses are primarily fixed costs. Marketing and promotions expenses are discretionary and are primarily incurred in an effort to maintain and/or increase our audience share.  
    
  Entertainment 
    
  Our Entertainment segment is composed of a diverse range of live events, which we create, promote and produce, including festivals, concerts, trade shows and other experiential events within and beyond our markets, and music and lifestyle content distributed through our owned, operated and affiliated national websites. 
    
  Our primary source of Entertainment net revenue is from ticket sales for our live events.  Our live events also generate substantial net revenue through the sale of sponsorships, ride tickets, food and other concessions, merchandise and other ancillary products and services. Live event ticket pricing is based on consumer demand for each event and the geographic location and target audience demographic of each event. Unforeseen events such as inclement weather conditions can have an adverse impact on our Entertainment net revenue. In certain cases, we mitigate this risk with insurance policies, which cover a portion of lost revenue as a result of unforeseen events including inclement weather. 
    
  Another source of Entertainment net revenue is national digital advertising, primarily display advertisements on our  network of owned, operated and affiliated music and entertainment websites.  Our national digital sales team also sells product-activation sponsorship and advertising related to our live events. Our national digital assets are subject to general advertising trends as well as advertisers  perception and demand for our products. A downturn in advertising spending or the economy could have an adverse effect on this net revenue.  
    
  Certain expenses in our Entertainment segment are variable, including sales commissions, certain costs related to production and certain revenue sharing agreements with partners.  A portion of our revenue and expenses related to our North American Midway Entertainment, Inc. ("NAME") operations are denominated in Canadian dollars and expose us to translational foreign currency risk.  We have not historically hedged our exposure to this risk.        

Seasonality 
    
  Our net revenue varies throughout the year. We expect that our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest net revenue for the year, as advertising expenditures generally decline following the winter holidays, and the second and third calendar quarters will generally produce the highest net revenue for the year. During even-numbered years, net revenue generally includes increased advertising expenditures by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. Political spending is typically highest during the fourth quarter. In addition to advertising revenue seasonality, our Entertainment net revenue exhibits seasonality resulting in the third quarter being the highest revenue period, followed by the second, then fourth, then first quarter. Large drivers of this seasonality are our summertime

multi-day music festivals, and NAME's revenue which is concentrated in the third quarter. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on net revenue generation until future periods, if at all. 

Macroeconomic Indicators 
    
  Our advertising revenue for our businesses may be highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP ), as advertising spending has historically trended in line with, and in our experience often lags, changes in GDP.  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce estimate as of  October 28, 2016, U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the third quarter of   2016  .

     Table of Contents     

On a pro forma consolidated basis, net revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $0.3 million  , or   0.2%  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease resulted from a   $3.6 million   decrease in Entertainment net revenue, which was partially offset by a   $3.3 million   increase in Local Marketing Solutions net revenue.  The decrease in Entertainment net revenue was primarily the result of inclement weather, specifically for our NAME events. The increase in Local Marketing Solutions net revenue was driven by an increase in political net revenue of $1.0 million and non-political net revenue of $2.3 million.   
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015: 

The following table summarizes our pro forma net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016: 

On a pro forma consolidated basis, net revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   $8.4 million  , or   2.2%  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase resulted from a   $12.1 million   increase in Local Marketing Solutions net revenue, offset by a decrease in Entertainment net revenue of   $3.7 million  .  The increase in Local Marketing Solutions net revenue was driven by an increase in political net revenue of $2.7 million and non-political net revenue of $9.4 million. The decrease in Entertainment net revenue was primarily the result of inclement weather, specifically for our NAME events. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We fund our working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from our operating, investing and financing activities. Based on current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets and industry, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from our operating, investing and financing activities, together with funds available under our revolving credit facility, will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements for at least the next twelve months.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $572.8 million   of outstanding indebtedness, net of deferred financing costs of   $8.4 million  , and based on interest rates in effect as of that date, we expect our debt service requirements to be approximately $31.5 million over the next twelve  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents     

months.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   we have   $38.4 million   of cash,   $65.4 million   of receivables from customers, which historically have had an average collection cycle of approximately 45 days, and $50.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.  
    
  Our anticipated uses of cash in the near term include working capital needs, debt payments, other obligations, and capital expenditures. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments, other obligations, capital expenditures, and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions, increases or decreases in advertising spending, rapid changes in the highly competitive industry in which we operate and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
    
  Additionally, on a continual basis, we evaluate and consider strategic acquisitions and divestitures to enhance our strategic and competitive position as well as our financial performance. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital and such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. 
    
  We closely monitor the impact of capital and credit market conditions on our liquidity as related to our floating rate debt. We also routinely monitor the changes in the financial condition of our customers and the potential impact on our results of operations. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased   $26.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to   $40.2 million  .  During the nine months ended 2015 we made a one-time cash payment of $27.7 million on April 1, 2015 to lenders for the redemption of the Unsecured Senior Notes due 2019 issued by our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. Excluding this non-recurring payment to lenders in 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities would have been $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which would equate to a decrease of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the prior year period. This decrease, excluding the non-recurring payment to lenders, was due to $9.7 million more cash generated by our operations in 2016 than in 2015, offset by (i) an increase in accounts receivable of $4.6 million primarily relating to our live events and (ii) a decrease of $6.1 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
    Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $48.3 million   to   $16.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $65.0 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for acquisitions of   $72.2 million   and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets of   $17.3 million  . This was partially offset by increased spending for capital expenditures of   $6.9 million  , of which $5.1 million relates to NAME, which we acquired on September 1, 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
    Net cash used in financing activities was   $17.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $54.7 million   of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in   2015  . In 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily composed of new borrowings, net of debt repayments and debt issuance fees, of $55.1 million as a result of our refinancing, which closed on April 1, 2015. In 2016, cash used in financing activities was primarily composed of voluntarily payments made to repurchase and cancel $17.9 million of our 2023 Notes outstanding at a market price below par, plus accrued interest.  The gain of the repurchases of $0.5 million is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents     

On April 1, 2015, the Company issued $300.0 million of 6.5% Unsecured Senior Notes due in 2023 and a Senior Secured Credit Facility, which included a seven year, $275.0 million term loan facility and a five year, $50.0 million revolving credit facility. The Term Loans have an initial interest rate of 4.25% (based on current LIBOR levels, a 1.00% LIBOR floor and an applicable margin of 325 basis points).  The Revolver has an interest rate based either on LIBOR and an applicable margin of 250 basis points, or an alternative base rate and an applicable margin of 150 basis points.  
    
  On September 1, 2015, the Company issued incremental term loans of $45.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the proceeds of which were used to partially fund the purchase price of NAME. Further, on September 30, 2015, the Company made a $20.0 million voluntary prepayment of borrowings under the Term Loan. 
    
  On March 24, 2016, we voluntarily repurchased $0.7 million of our 2023 Notes at a market price below par, plus accrued interest.  We canceled the repurchased notes.  A gain of $34 thousand is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we voluntarily repurchased an aggregate of $17.2 million of our 2023 Notes at market prices below par, plus accrued interest.  We canceled the repurchased notes.  A gain of $0.4 million is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recognized a loss of $0.3 million on the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the voluntary repurchases on our 2023 Notes, which is included in interest expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all terms and covenants of its borrowing arrangements, and has $50 million of revolving credit availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.  
    
  We have historically serviced our debt obligations from funds generated by operating activities. We believe that our cash balance, together with our remaining capacity under the Revolver and cash generated by operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pursue our strategy for the next twelve months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our significant estimates, including those related to bad debts, intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual amounts and results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   
    
  We believe the accounting policies and estimates discussed within  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report.

  The following discussion should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those discussed within our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in   our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K  . 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   we were not subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our existing 2023 Notes. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   we were subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, specifically the impact of LIBOR interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.  Based upon our   September 30, 2016   outstanding term loan borrowings of   $298.5 million   under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, an increase in the LIBOR interest rate of 1% would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately $1.2 million.  We anticipate such interest rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Furthermore, our controls and procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis. 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls 
    
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REGISTRATION AGREEMENT 
    
  THIS   REGISTRATION   AGREEMENT   (this      Agreement   ),   dated   as   of August 16, 2016, is made by and among (i) Townsquare Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), (ii) Madison Square Garden Investments, LLC (the    Investor   ), and (iii) each of the other Persons signatory hereto and each other Person who, at any time, acquires securities of the Company and (a) executes a counterpart of this Agreement or (b) otherwise agrees to be bound by this Agreement, in each of the case of (a) and (b), with the written consent of the Investor (such Persons, together with each other Person identified as an  Other Securityholder  on the   Schedule of Securityholders   attached hereto, the    Other Securityholders   ).  The Investor and the Other Securityholders are collectively referred to herein as the    Securityholders  .  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in   Section 9   below. As set forth in   Section 10(i)   below, this Agreement, together with that certain letter agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between the Company and the Investor, setting forth the Investor s observation rights with respect to meetings of the Company s Board of Directors, embodies the complete agreement and understanding of the Company and the Securityholders with respect to the subject matter hereof and the Securityholders are neither party to, nor beneficiaries of, any other agreement with the Company, including the Existing Registration Agreement. 
    
  In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows: 
    
  1.           Demand Registrations  . 
    
  (a)         Requests for Registration  .  At any time on or after the third anniversary of the date hereof, the holders of a majority of the Investor Registrable Securities may request registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or any similar long-form registration (   Long-Form Registrations   ) or, if available, on Form S-3 (including pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act) or any similar short-form registration (   Short-Form  Registrations   ).    All  registrations  requested  pursuant  to  this     Section 1(a)    are referred to herein as    Demand Registrations    provided, however, that a Demand Registration may only be made if the sale of the Investor Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the holders of a majority of the Investor Registrable Securities is reasonably expected to result in a sale of at least 750,000 shares of Class A Common Stock.   Each request for a Demand Registration shall specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered and the anticipated per share price range for such offering and whether the Demand Registration will be underwritten.   Within ten (10) days after receipt of any such request, the Company shall give written notice of such requested registration to all other holders of Registrable  Securities  and,  subject  to    Section 1(d)  ,  will  include  in  such  registration  all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein from such Persons within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Company s notice. 
    
  (b)         Demand  Registrations  .     The  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  Investor Registrable  Securities  shall  be entitled  to  request  two  (2)  Demand  Registrations.    Demand Registrations will be Short-Form Registrations whenever the Company is permitted use any applicable short form.  The Company may satisfy its obligations under   Section 1(a)   hereof by amending (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any registration statement previously filed by  

the Company under the Securities Act, so that such amended registration statement will permit the disposition of all of the Registrable Securities for which  a request  for Demand Registration has been properly made under   Section 1(a)   hereof. If the Company so amends a previously filed registration statement and such amendment becomes effective under the Securities Act and the Company otherwise complies with the requirements of this Agreement, it will be deemed to have effected a registration for purposes of   Section 1(a)   hereof. 
    
  (c)        Priority on Demand Registrations  .   If a Demand Registration is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that, in their opinion, the number of Registrable Securities and, if permitted hereunder, other securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number of Registrable Securities and other securities, if any, which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within the price range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities initially requesting such registration, the Company will include in such registration, (i)   first  , (a) the Registrable Securities requested  to be included  in  such registration  and (b) any other securities  of the Company required to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms of the Existing Registration Agreement, in each case that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder, and (ii)   second  , other securities requested (and permitted) to be included in such registration, if any, that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of such securities owned by each such holder. 
    
  (d)         Restrictions  on  Demand  Registrations  .     The  Company  shall  not  be obligated  to  effect  any  Demand  Registration  within  180  days  after  the  effective  date  of  a previous Demand Registration or a previous registration in which the holders of Registrable Securities were given the right to piggyback pursuant to   Section 2  .  The Company may postpone for up to six months the filing or the effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, a registration statement for a Demand Registration if the Company determines in good faith that such Demand Registration would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company or its business or on any proposal or plan by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to acquire financing, sell any securities, engage in any acquisition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) or engage in any merger, consolidation, tender offer, reorganization, other significant business transaction or any similar transaction or if the Company determines in good faith that such Demand Registration hereunder would reasonably be expected to interfere with a proposed or planned registration pursuant to an Existing Registration Agreement;   provided   that, in such event, the Company shall pay all Registration Expenses of the Investor if the Investor is unable to effect the proposed sale under a Demand Registration during the six month period immediately following the end of such postponement solely due to market conditions. The aggregate length of time that a Demand Registration may be delayed pursuant this   Section 1(d)     shall not exceed six months in any twelve month period  . 
    
  (e)         Selection of Underwriters  .   The holders of a  majority of the  Investor Registrable Securities included in any Demand Registration shall have the right to select the investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) to administer the offering, subject to the consent of the Company and the right of any party to an Existing Registration Agreement to approve such selection, which, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

2.           Piggyback Registrations  . 
    
  (a)         Right to Piggyback  .  Whenever the Company proposes to register any of its equity securities (including any proposed registration of the Company s securities by any third party) under the  
  
   2 

Securities Act (other than (i) pursuant to a Demand Registration, which is governed by   Section 1   or (ii) pursuant to a registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar forms), whether or not for sale for its own account, and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Registrable Securities (a    Piggyback Registration   ), the Company shall give prompt written notice to all holders of Registrable Securities of its intention to effect such a registration and will include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein from such Persons within five (5) business days after the receipt of the Company s notice. 
    
  (b)        Priority on Primary Registrations  .   If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the Company, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that, in their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the Company, then the Company shall include in such registration (i)   first  , (a) the securities the Company proposes to sell and (b) any other securities of the Company required to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms of the Existing Registration Agreement that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, (ii)   second  , to the extent permitted by the Existing Registration Agreement, securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms of the Existing Registration Agreement, if any, that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of such securities owned by each such holder, (iii)   third  , the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration, if any, that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder, and (iv)   fourth  , other securities requested (and permitted) to be included in such registration, if any, that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of such securities owned by each such holder. 
    
  (c)         Priority on Secondary Registrations  .   If   a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Company s securities other than holders of Registrable Securities (it being understood that secondary registrations on behalf of holders of Registrable Securities are addressed in   Section 1   rather than this   Section 2(c)  ), and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that, in their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the securities initially requested to be included in such registration, then the Company shall include in such registration (i)   first  , the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the holders of such securities and the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities owned by each such holder (ii)   second  , upon the consent of the holders requesting such registration, if applicable, the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range, pro rata among the holders of such securities and the holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the number of securities owned by each such holder, and (iii)   third  , other securities requested (and permitted) to be included in such registration, if any, that, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold in an orderly manner within such price range. 

3.           Holdback Agreements  . 
    
  (a)       Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees that in connection with any Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration (whether such registration occurs before or after the third anniversary  
  
   3 

of the date hereof) that is an underwritten public offering of the Company s equity securities, whether or not such holder is participating in such offering, he, she or it shall not (i) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (including sales pursuant to Rule 144), directly or indirectly, any equity securities of the Company (   Securities   ) (including Securities which may be deemed to be owned beneficially by such holder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission), or any securities, options, or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Securities (   Other Securities   ), (ii) enter into a transaction which would have the same effect as described in clause (i) of this   Section 3(a)  , (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences or ownership of any Securities or Other Securities, whether such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such Securities or Other Securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iv) publicly disclose the intention to enter into any transaction described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, from the date on which the Company gives notice to the holders of Registrable Securities that a preliminary prospectus has been circulated for the underwritten public offering to the date that is 90 days following the date of the final prospectus for such underwritten public offering (in each case, or such longer period as agreed to by the underwriters designated  as   book-runners  managing such registered  public offering),  unless  such book- runners otherwise agree in writing (such period, the    Holdback Period       provided   that the holdback obligations set forth in this   Section 3(a)   shall not be effective or shall be reduced, as applicable, if, in any underwritten offering, the managing underwriter indicates in writing to the Company that such holdback obligations are not necessary or may be shortened in the applicable Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration.   The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to its securities that are subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of  such  period.  The  holdback  obligations  set  forth  in  this    Section  3(a)    will  automatically terminate upon any release or termination of such holdback obligations for the holders of a majority of shares included in such Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration to which such Holdback Period relates. 
    
  (b)       In addition to the holdback obligations provided for in   Section 3(a)   above, in connection with any underwritten public offering of the Company s equity securities, each holder of Registrable Securities agrees to enter into any lockup or similar agreement requested by the underwriters managing the registered public offering;   provided  , that in no event shall such lockup or similar agreement provide for a holdback period that is longer than the duration of the Holdback Period as determined pursuant to   Section 3(a)   above. 
    
  (c)       The Company agrees not to effect any Public Sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the seven days prior to and during the 60 day period beginning on the effective date of any Demand Registration (except as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form) unless the underwriter managing the registered public offering otherwise agrees. 

(d)       Notwithstanding  any other provision  contained  in  this  Agreement,  the Company shall not include in any underwritten Demand Registration any portion of Registrable Securities held by any officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the inclusion of which the underwriter of such Demand Registration determines is likely to adversely affect such offering. 
    
  (e)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in the case of (i) a transfer to the Company or (ii) a Public Sale which does not violate   Sections 3(a)   or   3(b)   (clauses (i) and (ii), a    Permitted Transfer   ), prior to transferring any Registrable Securities to any Person not already a party to this Agreement (including by operation of law), the transferring Securityholder shall cause the prospective transferee to execute and deliver to the Company a counterpart of this Agreement thereby agreeing to be bound by the terms hereof.  Any transfer or attempted transfer of any Registrable Securities in violation of  
  
   4 

any provision of this Agreement shall be void   ab initio  , and the Company shall not record such transfer on its books or treat any purported transferee of such securities as the owner of such securities for any purpose.  Other than in the case of a Permitted Transfer, whether or not any such transferee has executed a counterpart hereto, such transferee shall be subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder. 
    
  (f)        Each certificate evidencing any Securities or Other Securities held by a Securityholder and each certificate issued in exchange for or upon the transfer of any such securities (unless such securities are permitted to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement and, if such securities were Registrable Securities, would no longer be Registrable Securities after such  transfer)  shall  be  stamped  or  otherwise  imprinted  with  a  legend  in  substantially  the following form (together with any other legend that may be required pursuant to applicable law or the Company s certificate of incorporation or other organizational documents): 
    
  THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED ON                               AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND LAWS OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM. 

IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE   ARE   SUBJECT   TO   RESTRICTIONS   ON TRANSFER AND OTHER PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THE REGISTRATION AGREEMENT DATED AS OF AUGUST 16, 2016, AMONG THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY S SECURITYHOLDERS, AS AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME PURSUANT TO ITS TERMS.   A COPY OF SUCH REGISTRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE COMPANY TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST. 
    
  The  Company  shall  imprint  such  legend  on  certificates  evidencing  Securities  and  Other Securities outstanding prior to the date hereof.  The legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificates evidencing any securities which are transferred pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. 
    
  4.           Registration Procedures  .

  (d)       use  its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  register  or  qualify  such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any seller reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller (provided that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be  required  to  qualify  but  for  this    Section  4(d)  ,  (ii)  subject  itself  to  taxation  in  any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction); 
    
  (e)       notify in writing each seller of such Registrable Securities (i) promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the date and time when such registration statement and each post-effective amendment thereto has become effective or a prospectus or supplement to any prospectus  relating  to  a  registration  statement  has  been  filed  and  when  any registration  or qualification has become effective under a state securities or blue sky law or any exemption thereunder has been obtained, (ii) promptly after receipt thereof, of any request by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the amendment or supplementing of such registration statement or prospectus or for additional information, and (iii) at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement (x) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made or (y) is otherwise not legally available to support sales of Registrable Securities; 

6 

(f)        prepare and file promptly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and notify such holders of Registrable Securities prior to the filing of, such amendments or supplements to such registration statement or prospectus as may be necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when a prospectus relating to such securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event has occurred as the result of which any such prospectus or any other prospectus as then in effect would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, in case any of such holders of Registrable Securities or any underwriter for any such holders is required to deliver a prospectus at a time when the prospectus then in circulation is not in compliance with the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to  prepare  promptly  upon  request  of  any  such  holder  or  underwriter  such  amendments  or supplements to such registration statement and prospectus as may be necessary in order for such prospectus to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and such rules and regulations; 

(g)        cause  all  such  Registrable  Securities  to  be  listed  on  each  securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

  (i)      enter  into  and  perform  such  customary  agreements  (including underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all such other actions as any underwriters may reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities (including participation in  road shows,  investor presentations and marketing events); 
    
  (j)        make  available  for  inspection  by any underwriter  participating  in  any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant, or other agent retained by any such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company s officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent in connection with such registration statement and assist and, at the request of any participating underwriter, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such officers or directors to participate in presentations to prospective purchasers; 
    
  (k)       take all reasonable actions to ensure that any Free-Writing Prospectus utilized in   connection with any Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration hereunder complies in all material respects with the Securities Act, is filed in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby, is retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby and, when taken together with the related prospectus, will not contain any untrue statement  of  a  material  fact  or omit  to  state a material  fact  necessary to  make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 
    
  (l)       otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months beginning with the first day of the Company s first full calendar quarter after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder; 
    
  (m)      use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or of any order suspending or preventing the use

   8 

(b)       The Company shall pay its internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expense of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed.

  6.           Indemnification  .

In connection with an underwritten offering, the Company shall indemnify the underwriters, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of Registrable Securities. 

(b)       In  connection  with  any  registration  statement  in  which  a  holder  of Registrable Securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement  
  
   9 

or prospectus and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and hold harmless the other holders of Registrable Securities and the Company, and their respective directors, officers, managers, agents and employees and each other Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, together with reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney s fees), to which such indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, are caused by or result from (i) any untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any application or (ii) any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is made in such registration statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in each case, in reliance  upon  and  in  conformity  with  written  information  prepared  and  furnished  to  the Company by such holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify will be several and not joint, as to each holder and will be limited to the net amount of proceeds  received  by such  holder  from  the  sale  of  Registrable  Securities  pursuant  to  such registration statement. 
    
  (c)       Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such  indemnifying  party  to  assume  the  defense  of  such  claim  with  counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. 
    
  (d)      The indemnifying party shall not, except with the approval of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to each indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation without any payment or consideration provided by such indemnified party. 

(e)       If the indemnification provided for in this   Section 6   is unavailable to or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under the provisions above in respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the sellers of Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other hand or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative faults referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative benefit of the Company on the one hand and of the sellers of Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating  in  the  registration  statement  on  the  other  in  connection  with  the  registration statement or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.   
  
   10 

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the sellers of Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) to the Company bear to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) to the sellers of Registrable Securities and  any  other  sellers  participating  in  the  registration  statement.    The  relative  fault  of  the Company on the one hand and of the sellers of Registrable Securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the sellers of Registrable Securities or other sellers participating in the registration statement and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 
    
  (f)        The Company and the sellers of Registrable Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this   Section 6   were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the sellers of Registrable Securities were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this   Section 6  , no seller of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement filed pursuant hereto.   No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
    
  (g)       The  indemnification  and  contribution  by  any  such  party  provided  for under this Agreement shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made or omitted by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities.

  (b)       Each Person that is participating in any registration hereunder agrees that, upon  receipt  of any notice from  the Company of the happening of any event  of the kind described  in    Section  4(e)  ,

No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement, or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement, or condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an amendment or modification of this Agreement to add a party hereto and to grant such party registration rights will be effective against the Company and all holders of Registrable Securities if such modification, amendment or waiver is approved in writing by the Company (as applicable) and the holders of a  
   
  majority of the Investor Registrable Securities. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every provision in accordance with its terms. 
    
  (f)          Securityholder Status  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth herein, at such time as any Securityholder ceases to hold any Registrable Securities, such Securityholder shall be deemed to no longer be a Securityholder for purposes of this Agreement  and  shall  no  longer be entitled to  the rights  or  subject  to  the obligations  of  a Securityholder as set forth herein. 
    
  (g)         Successors and Assigns; Third-Party Beneficiaries  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto (and the Persons specifically identified in   Section 6  ) and their respective successors and assigns.   In addition, and whether or not any express assignment shall have been made, the provisions of this Agreement which are for the benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities (or any portion thereof) as such shall be for the benefit of and enforceable by any subsequent holder of any Registrable Securities (or of such portion thereof);   provided  , that such subsequent holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to execute a joinder to this Agreement agreeing to be bound by its terms. 
    
  (h)         Severability  .  Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. 
    
  (i)          Entire Agreement  .   Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this document embodies the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way, including without limitation the Existing Registration Agreement. 
    
  (j)          Counterparts; Facsimile Signature  .  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature. 
    
  (k)         Descriptive Headings  .   The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement. 

17 

(l)          Governing Law  .   All issues and questions concerning the relative rights and obligations of the Company and the Securityholders under this Agreement and the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 
    
  (m)        Consent to Jurisdiction  .  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware and the state courts of the State of Delaware for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.  Each of the parties hereto further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by United States certified or registered mail to such party s respective address set forth in    Section 10(a)   and the   Schedule of Securityholders   attached hereto, or such other address or to the attention of such other person as the recipient party has specified by prior written notice to the sending party, shall be effective service of process in any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence.   Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the United States District Court for the State of Delaware or the state courts of the State of Delaware and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
    
  (n)         Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial  .  Because disputes arising in connection with complex transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the parties desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. Therefore,  to  achieve  the  best  combination  of  the  benefits  of  the  judicial  system  and  of arbitration, each party to this Agreement hereby waives all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties hereto, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related or incidental to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 
    
  (o)         Business Days  .   If any time period for giving notice or taking action hereunder expires on a day which is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state in which the Company s chief-executive office is located, the time period shall automatically be extended to the business day immediately following such Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
