NOTE
1   BUSINESS    

Overview   

  MOJO
Organics, Inc. ( MOJO  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 2, 2007.
Headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, the Company develops emerging beverage brands that are natural, USDA Organic and Non GMO Project
verified.  

Beginning
in December 2015, the Company began selling its line of coconut water beverages. Previously, the Company produced juice under
a license branding agreement (the  License Agreement ). The License Agreement was terminated September 27, 2015. See
Note 5 in the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

  The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting
on Form 10-Q  and article 10 of Regulation S-X and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures included in these financial statements are adequate
to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited interim condensed financial statements included in this document
have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements, and in the Company s opinion, reflect all
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP and SEC regulations for interim financial statements. The
results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that the Company will have
for any subsequent period. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and the notes to those statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual  Report
on Form 10-K.   

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates   

  The
financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

  Cash
equivalents include investment instruments and time deposits purchased with a maturity of three months or less.  

Accounts
Receivable   

  Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts based upon its assessment of the current status of the individual receivables and after using reasonable
collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was zero and $3,000, respectively.  

Inventories   

  Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. When necessary, the Company provides allowances to adjust
the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value.     

Supplier
Deposits   

  Supplier
Deposits consist of payments to manufacturers for future production.  

Property
and Equipment and Depreciation   

  Property
and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful
life of the respective assets.  Computer equipment is depreciated over a period of three years.  Computer Software
is depreciated over a one year period.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.  When property
and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gain or loss is credited or charged to income.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated
depreciation related to property and equipment was $869 and $935, respectively.  

Revenue
Recognition   

  Revenue
from the sale of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred,
the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs incurred for sales incentives and discounts
are accounted for as a reduction in revenue.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs   

  Shipping
and Handling Costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the
line Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in our Statements of Operations.  

Net
Loss Per Common Share   

  The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 260,   Earnings per Share  .  ASC Topic 260 requires
presentation of basic and diluted EPS.  Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.  

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact on the Company s net loss
per common share:  

Start-Up
Costs   

  In
accordance with ASC topic 720-15,   Start-Up Costs ,  the Company charges all costs associated with its start-up
operations to expense as incurred.  

Income
Taxes   

  The
Company provides for income taxes under ASC topic 740,   Income Taxes ,  which requires the use of an asset and
liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected
to reverse. ASC Topic 740 also requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight
of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax returns
for the years from 2012 to 2015 are subject to examination by tax authorities.  

The
Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. The Company has had no Federal or state tax examinations
in the past nor does it have any at the current time.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

  ASC
Topic 718,   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   prescribes accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
compensation plans, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.
ASC Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for
employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718.  

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 505-50,   Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees .   ASC Subtopic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments, other than common
stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

  The
carrying amounts of financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt
obligations approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature and/or variable interest rates. The Company s debt
obligations bear interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments with similar characteristics and,
accordingly, the carrying values for these instruments approximate fair value.  

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement ,  which established a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value. ASC Topic 820 describes the following three levels of inputs that may be used:  

Level
    1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,, unrestricted assets
    or liabilities;   

Level
    2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
    the full term of the asset or liability;   

Level
    3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (supported by little or no market activity).   

The
Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 or December
31, 2015. The Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

  In
May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, which creates ASC Topic 606,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  , and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  

Revenue
Recognition  , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
In addition, ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35,   Revenue Recognition Construction-Type
and Production-Type Contracts ,  and creates new Subtopic 340-40,   Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts
with Customers .  In summary, the core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services
are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period, and early application is not permitted. Therefore the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will become
effective for us as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the impact of implementing the
new guidance.  

In
August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern  (Subtopic 205-40)  
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . Currently, there is
no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance.
In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments
require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.  

Specifically,
the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require an evaluation every reporting period
including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of  

  management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in
this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company adopted SU 2014-15 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.   

Reclassifications   

  Certain
amounts in the September 30, 2015 Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the September
30, 2016 Financial Statements.  

NOTE
3   GOING CONCERN   

The
expansion and development of our business has been funded primarily through the sale of Company stock. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $337,500 in a private placement (see Note 6 for further information). As of September
30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $326,038. The Company has received purchase orders to be fulfilled from both new
customers and existing customers. As a result, the Company believes it has sufficient cash and revenue commitments to finance
its operations over the next twelve month period. We continue to market our products in accordance with our business plan. There
can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to generate sufficient revenues through our marketing
efforts.  

NOTE
4   INVENTORY   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted of finished goods of $215,914 and $33,473, respectively.

Advisory
Services   

  On
October 3, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Ian Thompson for strategic business advisory services, public relations
services and investor relations services. In connection with this agreement, the Company issued 167,204 shares of restricted Common
Stock to Ian Thompson and recorded consulting fees of $501,612 during 2013, which was the fair market value of the stock on the
date of issue; there was no cash payment to Ian Thompson by the Company. The stock is fully vested, however it is restricted from
trading. Ian Thompson was also issued 200,000 shares of restricted Common Stock for future services that included, but not limited
to strategic business advisory services, public relations services and investor relations services which was to vest in mid-2014.
Consulting fees of $105,000 and $280,000 were recorded in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the 200,000 shares of Common
Stock issued to Ian Thompson.  

During
the term of the agreement, the Company requested Ian Thompson to render performance under the agreement and to provide evidence
of same in consideration of the payment of $886,612. Ian Thompson failed to perform in all material respects under the terms of
the agreement and failed to provide evidence.  

On
June 27, 2014, by a unanimous written consent of the board of directors, the Company terminated the agreement with Ian Thompson
and authorized the cancellation of the 367,204 shares issued with a value of $886,612, due to lack of delivery of consideration
and material breach of the agreement.

ITEM
2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is provided
in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. MD A is organized as follows:  

Critical Accounting
    Policies   Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated
    in our reported financial results and forecasts.   

Results of Operations
      Analysis of our financial results comparing the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September
    30, 2015.   

Results of Operations
      Analysis of our financial results comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September
    30, 2015.   

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources   Analysis of changes in our cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of
    liquidity.   

This
report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance.  Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate,
intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.  You should not place
undue certainty on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report.  These forward
looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.   

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions
we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included
in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different
assumptions, judgments or conditions.  

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements,
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates,
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important
to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.  

We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements:  

Use
of Estimates     The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ( GAAP ). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Stock-based
Compensation     ASC Topic 718,   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   prescribes accounting
and reporting standards for all stock-based compensation plans, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock
purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.  

ASC
Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718. For non-employee options and warrants, the company
uses the fair value method as prescribed in ASC Topic 718.   

Determining
the appropriate fair value of the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected
life of the stock-based payment and stock price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing option model to
value its stock option awards which incorporate the Company s stock price, volatility, U.S. risk-free rate, dividend rate,
and estimated life.  

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 505-50,   Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees .   ASC Subtopic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments, other than common
stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC, did not, or are
not believed by management, to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.  

COMPANY
OVERVIEW   

Headquartered
in Jersey City, New Jersey, the Company engages in product development, production, marketing and distribution of emerging beverage
brands that are natural, USDA Organic and non-genetically modified.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported revenue of $510,658, an increase of $467,183 over revenue of $43,475
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, revenue was comprised of sales of coconut water.  In
2015, revenue was comprised of sales from juice products.     

Cost
of Revenue   

Cost
of Revenue includes production costs, raw material costs and freight in costs.  Also included in Cost of Revenue is adjustments
made to inventory carrying amounts, including markdowns to market and write offs of expiring inventory.    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenue was $298,606 or 58% of revenue, compared to $81,835 or 188% of revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $311,609. For the three months ended
September 30, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses were $351,629. The decrease of $40,020 is attributable to a decrease
in stock-based compensation costs, offset by an increase in selling expenses as a result of the increased revenue.  

Stock-based
compensation costs to directors and employees consist of charges to income for vesting in connection with restricted stock issuances,
stock options and warrants. Although stock-based compensation costs reduce the Company s earnings, they do not reduce
cash and have no effect on working capital.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $60,000 in license fees.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported revenue of $1,173,173, an increase of $983,092 or 517% over revenue
of $190,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, revenue was comprised of sales of coconut water.  In
2015, revenue was comprised of sales from juice products.     

Cost
of Revenue

made to inventory carrying amounts, including markdowns to market and write offs of expiring inventory.   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenue was $682,232 or 58% of revenue, compared to $320,568 or 169% of revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cost of revenue included $228,074
related to the discontinuance of its juice products as well as an inventory adjustment of $31,976 to adjust the value of inventory
to the lower of cost or market.  

Operating
Expenses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,319,874, a decrease of $312,318
over selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,632,192 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is
attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation costs of $404,887, offset by increases in selling expenses as a result
of the increased revenue.  

Stock-based
compensation costs to directors and employees consist of charges to income for vesting in connection with restricted stock issuances,
stock options and warrants. Although stock-based compensation costs reduce the Company s earnings, they do not reduce
cash and have no effect on working capital.  

The
termination of the License Agreement resulted in a gain of $417,223 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $326,038. Net cash used in operating activities was $336,260 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Included in this amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is an increase in accounts
receivable of $234,982 and an increase in inventory of $182,441. Net cash provided by financing activities was $337,500 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Working
Capital Needs   

Our
working capital requirements increase when we experience a demand for our products. Due to an increased demand, the Company raised
$337,500 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 through the issuance of Common Stock. If during the next twelve months
the Company requires additional working capital, it may seek to raise additional   funds.  Financing transactions
may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Further, if
the Company issues additional equity or convertible debt securities, stockholders may experience dilution and the new equity securities
could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of the Company s Common Stock.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS    

The
Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.

4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be
noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions,
regardless of how remote.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s senior management, consisting of the Company s principal
executive and financial officer and the Company s principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation,
the Company s principal executive and financial officer concluded, as of the Evaluation Date, that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.  

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

The
management of MOJO Organics, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  

Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In
evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this
evaluation, our officers concluded that, during the period covered by this annual report, our internal controls over financial
reporting were operating effectively.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
