     Table of Contents           PART I         ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.        This Report contains summaries of the material terms of various agreements executed in connection with the transactions described herein. The summaries of these agreements are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, these agreements, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.        Business Development       SMACK Sportswear ( SMACK or the Company ) was originally incorporated in Nevada in October 2007. Through June 30, 2016, we were a manufacturer and seller of performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. As of July 31, 2015 we completed the disposition of certain assets of the Company to William Sigler, a former director of the Company; in connection with said transactions Mr. Sigler resigned and agreed to sell all his shares of common stock in the Company. As a result of the sale of certain inventory from the Company to Mr. Sigler, the Company is now considered a  shell company  (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).      The Company is now focusing its efforts on seeking a business opportunity. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the merger of that target company into the Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute assets to the Company rather than merge. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company will provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting ( public ) company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary market. We are now considered a  blank check  company.      The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and extremely risky and will be made by management in the exercise of its business judgment. There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to our company and shareholders.      On January 15, 2016, pursuant to the share exchange agreement, among Almost Never Films Inc. f/k/a Smack Sportswear (the  Company ,  we,   our  or  us ), Almost Never Films Inc. ( ANF ), an Indiana corporation, and the two shareholders of ANF (the  ANF Shareholders ), we issued to the ANF Shareholders, 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred Stock ), par value $0.001 per share in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of the issued and outstanding common stock of ANF (the  Share Exchange ). As a result of the Share Exchange, ANF became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and our business has become the business of ANF, effective January 15, 2016.      The share exchange was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition," and resulted in a recapitalization. Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $6,566 and $598,869, respectively. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the share exchange will be those of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and the combined financial statements after completion of the share exchange include the assets and liabilities of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), historical operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  from the closing date of the share exchange. As a result of the issuance of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the share exchange, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the share exchange. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. The Company has not yet generated any revenue since the reverse acquisition.      On February 29, 2016, the stockholders of Smack voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the authorized capital of the Company to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) to change the name of the Company to  Almost Never Films Inc.  which took effect on March 2, 2016.                  4       
     Table of Contents          The Company has 5,000,000 authorized preferred shares with no par value.     Smack issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to the Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), with a value of $10,000.     On March 4, 2016, all 1,000,000 preferred shares were converted into 100,000,000 common shares.     There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016.     On March 8, 2016, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with a shareholder. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and said shareholder purchased, an aggregate of 49,720,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at a price of $0.005 per share in exchange for the cancellation of and discharge of certain promissory notes issued by the Company and payable to said shareholder. The foregoing issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving any public offering and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws.     In March 2016, the Company entered into three share purchase agreements with three investors for 10,000,000 common shares at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $200,000. As of June 30, 2016, $135,000 was received by the Company and $65,000 was recorded as stock subscription receivable.      Criteria       We are a film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range.      The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada in October 2007 as Smack Sportswear ( Smack ), which originally manufactured and sold performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. The Company is now an independent film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range.       Share Exchange and Recapitalization       On January 15, 2016, Smack entered into a share exchange agreement with Almost Never Films Inc., a private company incorporated in Indiana on July 8, 2015, and its two shareholders, Danny Chan and Derek Williams.      Pursuant to the agreement, Smack issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana). As a result of the share exchange, Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) became Smack s wholly-owned subsidiary, and Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams acquired a controlling interest in the Company.      The share exchange was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition," and resulted in a recapitalization. Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $6,566 and $598,869, respectively. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the share exchange will be those of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and the combined financial statements after completion of the share exchange include the assets and liabilities of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), historical operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  from the closing date of the share exchange. As a result of the issuance of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the share exchange, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the share exchange. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. The Company has not yet generated any revenue since the reverse acquisition.                 5       
     Table of Contents          On February 29, 2016, the stockholders of Smack voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the authorized capital of the Company to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) to change the name of the Company to  Almost Never Films Inc.  which took effect on March 2, 2016.      We continue to be a "smaller reporting company," as defined under the Exchange Act, following the Share Exchange. We continue to be a  shell company , as defined under the Exchange Act, following the Share Exchange.       History        As described above, we were incorporated in Nevada in October 2007 under the name SMACK Sportswear under which we manufactured and sold performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. As a result of the sale of certain inventory from the Company to Mr. Sigler in July 2015, the Company became a  shell company  (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Share Exchange, we acquired the proposed business of Almost Never.      Almost Never, our wholly-owned subsidiary upon the closing of Share Exchange, was incorporated in the State of Indiana on July 8, 2015. As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from  Smack Sportswear  to  Almost Never Films Inc.  to more accurately reflect its new business. We also changed the Company s OTCQB trading symbol to "HLWD".      We currently have authorized 205,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares designated as preferred stock containing such rights, privileges and designations as our Board of directors may, from time to time, determine. As of the date of this Report, an aggregate of 177,707,623 shares of our Common Stock are issued and outstanding and 10,000,000 common stocks subscribed.      On March 4, 2016, all 1,000,000 preferred shares were converted into 100,000,000 common shares. In March 2016, the Company entered into three share purchase agreements with three investors for 10,000,000 common shares at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $200,000 As of June 31, 2016, $135,000 was received by the Company and $65,000 was recorded as stock subscription receivable.      On March 8, 2016, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with a shareholder. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and said shareholder purchased, an aggregate of 49,720,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at a price of $0.005 per share in exchange for the cancellation of and discharge of certain promissory notes issued by the Company and payable to said shareholder. The foregoing issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving any public offering and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws.      After the Share Exchange, our principal executive office is now located at 13636 Ventura Blvd #475, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.       Our Business      We are an independent film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range.     Our proposed business is to facilitate relationships (and as such, provide production related services) between creative talent (including writers, actors and directors) and companies who produce, finance and distribute motion pictures. We intend to acquire or license rights to materials upon which we believe motion pictures can be based (screenplays, books, short stories etcetera, which are referred to within the entertainment industry as the  underlying property ). We may further develop an underlying property by contracting for additional writing services and/or by bringing in new writers to perform  polishes  or  rewrites  on a particular underlying property.                  6       
     Table of Contents          If we are satisfied with the creative state of the underlying property, we then intend to make offers to directors and/or actors, to perform services in connection with a particular motion picture based on that underlying property. These offers are very often contingent and subject to the satisfaction of certain production elements, such as financier approval of the screenplay and the financier s selection of a start date for principal photography.      If a director or actors accepts one of our offers, the director or actors are said to be  attached  to the motion picture project. Armed with the underlying property and the attached creative element(s) (these elements are often called the  package  in Hollywood), we may then approach third party financiers seeking financing as well as distribution for the potential motion picture.  Another approach that we may take is to contact the financiers first, seeking first to produce the film, and then with a finished (or nearly finished) motion picture product, obtain distribution for the picture.      Motion Picture Property Acquisition Process       Our acquisition process is the process by which we intend to acquire or license  underlying properties . In turn, we expect to use those properties to attract creative talent (including writers, actors and directors) to the potential motion picture project. If successful, we will then grant or license out those rights to third party financiers of motion pictures, who will then contract with the creative talent we have attracted to the property as well as finance, produce and distribute/exploit the motion picture.      Almost Never Feature Film Production       Our initial primary involvement with feature film production is in the area of the development of  underlying properties .  We intend to engage third parties to produce, finance and exploit/distribute the motion picture  packages  we put together. We may also provide production expertise (i.e.  production services ) to the third party producer and/or financier of the motion picture in question. If we do provide production expertise, we, or members of our executive team, Danny Chan and Derek Williams, may be credited as  producers  or  executive producers  of the particular film in question. We expect to primarily derive our income from producer fees, consulting and service fees as well as our participation in the profits of the various pictures produced by third parties, that were developed and/or  packaged  by us.     Our feature film strategy generally is to perform production services, develop and/or produce feature films when the production budgets for the films are expected to be entirely or substantially covered by a third party. In this way, we believe our risk is, by in large, only the capital required, if any, to develop and package the motion picture project. The entirety of the production budget, as well as any costs associated with distributing and/or exploiting the motion pictures in question, will be expected to be borne by a third party or parties who have the resources and expertise to produce and/or distribute motion pictures.       Distributing Almost Never Motion Pictures      Currently, we do not intend to directly distribute motion pictures. Instead, when we seek financing for our motion picture  packages,  the distribution rights are often obtained by the financier as collateral for their investment; in other words, third parties purchase the world-wide exploitation and distribution rights to a motion picture for the cost it takes to produce the motion picture.       Foreign Markets      In general, a very important portion of the financing for  independent  (i.e., not produced by a major studio or one of their subsidiaries) motion pictures comes from the  foreign markets  (i.e., those markets outside of the United States and English-speaking Canada). With respect to productions we are associated with, the third party financier owns and/or controls the production rights and uses these rights as collateral or purchases the rights outright in connection with the funding of the pictures we develop.                  7       
     Table of Contents           Profit Participation      Our profit participation in motion picture projects will be determined by a calculation that assumes that all  negative costs  (production costs) of the picture (including, but not limited to, costs for development, principal photography and post-production) and  distribution expenses  (including, but not limited to, costs for marketing the film at various international film markets as well as costs associated with the delivery of the film and the physical elements to the various licensees of the film) are recovered by the financier plus interest thereon. After repayment of all negative costs, distribution expenses and interest thereon, the financier/distributor will charge a  distribution fee  (often a percentage of the gross income) for performing any sales or distribution services in connection with the picture.  Following the payment of distribution fees and other costs, any amounts payable to creative elements that are contingent compensation (including, but not limited to, deferred compensation and bonuses) are paid to those third parties. Any money remaining is considered net profits from which profit participation is derived.       Competition      The motion picture industry is intensely competitive.  In addition to competing with the major film studios that dominate the motion picture industry, we will also compete with numerous independent motion picture production companies, television networks, pay television systems, and online streaming media companies such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.  Virtually all of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have been in business much longer than we have, and have significantly more resources at their disposal. Our competitors range from small independent producers to well financed established film studios, particularly, major U.S. film studios.       Intellectual Property      We believe that intellectual property will be material to our business and we will expend cost and effort in an attempt to develop and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis- -vis other parties' intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.      From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot offer any assurances that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.       Industry Background       The Feature Film Industry . The feature film industry encompasses the development, production and exhibition of feature-length motion pictures and their subsequent distribution in the online, DVD, television, video on demand and other ancillary markets.  The major studios dominate the industry, some of which have divisions that are promoted as "independent" distributors of motion pictures, including Universal Pictures, Warner Bros Entertainment (also known as Warner Bros. Studios, Inc., Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. commonly called Warner Bros., or simply WB) including subsidiaries New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment   DC Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox, Sony Pictures Entertainment (including Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures), Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, MGM Holdings and Lions Gate Entertainment.  In recent years, however, true "independent" motion picture production and distribution companies have played an important role   in the production of motion pictures for the worldwide feature film market.       Independent Feature Film Production and Financing . Generally, independent production companies do not have access to the extensive capital required to make big budget motion pictures, such as the "blockbuster" product produced by the major studios.  They also do not have the capital necessary to maintain the substantial overhead that is typical of such studios' operations.  Independent producers target their product at specialized markets and usually produce motion pictures with budgets of less than $25 million.  Generally, independent producers do not maintain significant infrastructure.  They instead hire only creative and other production personnel and retain the other elements required for development, pre-production, principal photography and post-production activities on a project-by-project basis.  Also, independent production companies typically finance their production activities from bank loans, pre-sales, equity offerings, co-productions and joint ventures rather than out of operating cash flow.  They generally complete financing of an independent motion picture prior to commencement of principal photography to minimize risk of loss.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Independent Feature Film Distribution .  Motion picture distribution encompasses the exploitation of motion pictures in theatres and in markets, such as the DVD, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and ancillary markets, such as hotels, airlines and streaming films on the Internet. Independent producers do not typically have distribution capabilities and rely instead on pre-sales to North American and international distributors.  Generally, the local distributor will acquire distribution rights for a motion picture in one or more of the aforementioned distribution channels from an independent producer.  The local distributor will agree to advance the producer a non-refundable minimum guarantee.  The local distributor will then generally receive a distribution fee of between 20% and 35% of receipts, while the producer will receive a portion of gross receipts in excess of the distribution fees, distribution expenses and monies retained by exhibitors. The local distributor and theatrical exhibitor generally will enter into an arrangement providing for the exhibitor's payment to the distributor of a percentage (generally 40% to 50%) of the box-office receipts for the exhibition period, depending upon the success of the motion picture.       Government Regulation      The Company is not currently subject to any direct government regulations, other than the securities laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to all publicly owned companies and laws and regulations applicable to general businesses.  It is possible that certain laws and regulations may be adopted at the local, state, national and international level that could affect the Company's operations.  Changes to such laws could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for the Company's products or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or a variety of other such costs, or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  If any such law or regulation is adopted it could limit the Company's ability to operate and could force the business operations to cease, which would have a significantly negative effect on the Company.       Employees      The Company currently has no employees. Danny Chan, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Derek Williams, our Chief Operating Officer, will operate the Company.        ITEM 1A.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.        ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in the exhibits to this Report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "target," "estimate," "expect" and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ("will," "may," "could," "should," etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under "Risk Factors" commencing on page 17 above, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and plans could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, some of which cannot be anticipated or predicted. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Report.      As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the past financial results of the Company is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of Almost Never, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered the historical financial results of the Company.      Upon the completion of the Share Exchange, Almost Never became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. All references to "Almost Never" shall mean and refer to Almost Never prior to the Share Exchange and to the Company as well as to the business of Almost Never (constituting our only business) after the Share Exchange as required by the context.      The following discussion highlights Almost Never's results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on Almost Never's audited and unaudited financial statements supplied as exhibits to this Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.       Basis of Presentation       The audited financial statements of Almost Never from July 8, 2015 to June 30, 2016, including a summary of our significant accounting policies and notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.  In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.              Overview       Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, on January 15, 2016, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to the Almost Never Shareholders in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never. As a result of the Exchange Agreement, Almost Never became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the two Almost Never Shareholders have voting power equal to approximately 80% of the voting power of the Company.     Almost Never Films Inc. was founded as an Indiana corporation in July 2015. Activities since inception, through June 30, 2016, were devoted primarily to business development that included meetings with producers, actors, directors and screenwriters in the film industry to explore various partnerships and other collaborations.  Development consists of meeting with screenwriters, producers, directors, talent agencies, and other motion picture industry executives.      As part of Share Exchange, Doug Samuelson, our sole officer, resigned from all his positions with the Company and Danny Chan was elected as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director on our Board, and Derek Williams was elected as our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams held the same executive office positions at Almost Never prior to the Share Exchange. Effectively ten (10) days after the filing and distribution of an Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1, Mr. Williams became a director on our Board and Doug Samuelson, a former director, resigned.        Results of Operations from Inception (July 8, 2016) to June 30, 2016        Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold       From inception (July 8, 2015) to June 30, 2016, the Company generated no revenues or cost of goods sold       General and Administrative Expenses and Professional Fees       General and administrative expenses for the period ended June 30, 2016, was $15,161. Professional fees for the period ended June 30, 2016 was $58,393.       Other Expense       During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company had interest expense of $6,650 relating to its notes payable. The Company also incurred a loss on debt settlement of $745,800.       Net Loss       Our net loss for the period ended June 30, 2016 was $826,004.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       For the period ended June 30, 2016      As of June 30, 2016, we had cash of $84,967, negative working capital of $278,906 and an accumulated deficit of $826,004.       Cash flows used in operating activities      During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company used cash flows in operating activities of $60,033. A net loss of $826,004 was offset by a loss on debt settlement of $745,800, a decrease in prepaid expenses that generated $3,440 of cash, and an increase in accounts payable that generated $16,731.             Cash flows provided by financing activities       During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company was provided $145,000 of cash flows from financing activities. Proceeds from common share issuance was $135,000, and proceeds from preferred share issuance was $10,000.       Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activity      During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company assumed net liabilities through a recapitalization of $592,302 and issued common stock to settle a note payable for $248,600. In addition, non-cash transactions involved a stock subscription receivable of $65,000 and there was non-cash preferred stock converted to common stock of $100,000.       Going Concern      The accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $826,004 and cash used in operating activities was $60,033, and as of that date, is delinquent in payments of $271,398 for payroll and sales taxes. The Company is also delinquent on a note payable $66,613 as of August 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $278,906 and an accumulated deficit of $826,004. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.      The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, an additional cash infusion and an identification of new business opportunities. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company raised $135,000 from investors to pay past obligations and to allow the Company to continue operating in its shell status. Management believes this funding and future funding will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, and will allow it to continue looking for opportunities to acquire operating companies or merge with other operational entities. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in case of equity financing.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K).       Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments      Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, our commitments to strategic alliance partners and the timing of the achievement of collaboration milestones. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      Not applicable.        ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.             ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA         PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION                                             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm      To the Board of Directors and Stockholders  Almost Never Films Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Almost Never Films Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively the  Company ) as of June 30, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the period from July 8, 2015 (Date of inception) to June 30, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at June 30, 2016 and the results of its consolidated operations and its cash flows for the period from July 8, 2015 (Date of inception) to June 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had no operating income over the period from July 8, 2015 (Date of inception) to June 30, 2016, and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     /s/ Simon   Edward, LLP     Los Angeles, California  October 7, 2016                       F-1

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     June 30, 2016       NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING       Nature of the Business      The Company ( Almost Never Films Inc. ) was originally incorporated in Nevada in October 2007 as Smack Sportswear ( Smack ), which originally manufactured and sold performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. The Company is now an independent film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range.      Share Exchange and Recapitalization      On January 15, 2016, Smack entered into a share exchange agreement with Almost Never Films Inc., a private company incorporated in Indiana on July 8, 2015, and its two shareholders, Danny Chan and Derek Williams.     Pursuant to the agreement, Smack issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana). As a result of the share exchange, Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) became Smack s wholly-owned subsidiary, and Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams acquired a controlling interest in the Company.     The share exchange was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition," and resulted in a recapitalization. Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $6,566 and $598,869, respectively. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the share exchange will be those of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and the combined financial statements after completion of the share exchange include the assets and liabilities of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), historical operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana)  from the closing date of the share exchange. As a result of the issuance of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the share exchange, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the share exchange. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception.     On February 29, 2016, the stockholders of Smack voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the authorized capital of the Company to 200,000,00 shares of common stock and (ii) to change the name of the Company to  Almost Never Films Inc.  which took effect on March 2, 2016.     The new symbol of the Company is HLWD.      Going Concern      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the period from July 8, 2015 to June 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $826,004 and cash used in operating activities was $60,033. As of June 30, 2016, the Company is delinquent in payments of $271,398 for payroll and sales taxes. The Company is also delinquent on a note payable $66,613 as of August 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $278,906 and an accumulated deficit of $826,004. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.                  F-6

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.      Basis of Consolidation      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Team Sports Superstore (Inactive) and Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used in valuing the fair value of common stock issued for services, among others. Actual results could differ from these estimates.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.     In addition to defining fair value, the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:                  F-7       
     Table of Contents         Level 1   inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.     Level 2   inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     Level 3   inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.     As of June 30, 2016, the balances reported for cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of their short maturities. Notes payable are recorded at agreed values. Debt balances are stated at historical amounts less principal payments, which approximate fair market value. The Company believes interest rates in its debt agreements are commensurate with lender risk profiles for similar companies.      Stock Subscription Receivable      The stock subscription receivable reflects the sales of common stock in March 2016 for which the Company had not received payment as of June 30, 2016. The Company is continuing communicate with this investor and anticipates that it will receive payment in 2016.      Loss per Share Calculations      Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the period ended June 30, 2016, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   The amendments in the ASU provide guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Earlier adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations.     In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The amendments in the ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year.  Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations.                  F-8       
     Table of Contents         Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.      NOTE 3   NOTE PAYABLE      In August 2015, Smack entered into an unsecured promissory note agreement with an individual. The agreement allowed for Smack to borrow up to $66,613 at an interest rate of 10 percent per year. This $66,613 note was assumed by the Company during the recapitalization. The outstanding balance under the agreement at June 30, 2016 was $66,613. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $5,510 of interest expense relating to the unsecured promissory note. The outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest is due by August 2016.        NOTE 4   DUE TO FORMER SHAREHOLDER AND OFFICER      On January 15, 2016, $240,000 short-term loans due to two former shareholders and officers of Smack were assumed by the Company during the recapitalization. On March 8, 2016, the Company issued 49,720,000 shares of the Company s common stock, with a fair value of $0.02 per share, in exchange for the cancellation of the above loans and accrued interest of $8,600, which resulted in a loss on loan settlement of $745,800.      NOTE 5   SHARE CAPITAL       Preferred Stock      The Company has 5,000,000 authorized preferred shares with no par value.     Smack issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to the Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), with a value of $10,000.     On March 4, 2016, all 1,000,000 preferred shares were converted into 100,000,000 common shares.     There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016.      Common Stock      Prior to January 15, 2016, there were 27,987,623 common shares issued to shareholders of Smack. These 27,987,623 common shares were considered new issuance as part of the reverse acquisition.     During the period from July 8, 2015 to June 30, 2016, the Company issued 6,750,000 common shares for cash in the amount of $135,000 and 49,720,000 common shares to settle notes payable and accrued interest of $248,600.     In March 2016, the Company entered into three share purchase agreements with three investors for 10,000,000 common shares at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $200,000, of which $135,000 was received by the Company prior to June 30, 2016 and $65,000 was recorded as stock subscription receivable.

     Table of Contents          NOTE 6   INCOME TAX      The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.     The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:            Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of:           The following table reconciles the US statutory rates to the Company s effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2016:                        Year Ended                       June 30, 2016            Effective tax rate attributable to:                  US statuary rate         34%           Less: change in unrecognized tax benefit from uncertain tax provision         (34%)            Tax per Financial Statement              -              Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Income Tax laws of United States of America, net operating loss carry forwards of $826,004 which expire commencing in fiscal 2035, for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. When a change in ownership occurs, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.            NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. The Company's officers have provided office services without charge. There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future.      NOTE 8   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued. Based on our evaluation no additional events have occurred that require disclosure.              ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE        The Company has had no disagreements with its certified public accountants with respect to accounting practices or procedures or financial disclosure.        ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.     Management, with the participation of the Interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the  material weaknesses  described below under  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,  which are in the process of being remediated as described below under  Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses.       Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting      Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:                   pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;                           provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and                           provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.          Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate this risk. Further, over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.            Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016. In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016.     A  material weakness  is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls. As a result of management's review of the investigation issues and results, and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of quarter related to the preparation of management's report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this annual report on Form 10-K, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following:     1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and     2) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.     We do not believe the material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
