1.    Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Additionally, the condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Item 2 of
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this Form 10-Q. Operating results
for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 24, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The condensed consolidated
balance sheet at December 26, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all
of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. For further
information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015. 

The Company s
fiscal year is based on a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Therefore the financial results
of certain 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week quarters, will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent
52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters. The quarters ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 both contain
operating results for 13 weeks. The Company s fiscal quarter and year ending December 31, 2016 will contain operating results
for 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively. 

At the Company s
Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved the cancellation of 10,000 registered shares
of the Company held by the Company (the  Formation Shares ) and the reduction in par value of each share of the Company
from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company s Articles of Association to effect a corresponding share capital
reduction. The Company completed the cancellation of the Formation Shares and the reduction in par value of each share and the
corresponding reduction of the Company s issued share capital during the quarter ended September 24, 2016. The related reduction
of share capital and corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital is reflected within the condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of September 24, 2016. 

2.    Inventories    

The components of
inventories consist of the following: 

3.    Earnings Per Share    

The following table
sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share: 

There were 3,170 and
4,075 anti-dilutive stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units (collectively  equity awards )
outstanding during the 13-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively. 

There were 3,696 and
4,108 anti-dilutive equity awards outstanding during the 39-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively. 

There were 26 and
5 shares issued as a result of exercises and releases of equity awards for the 13-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September
26, 2015, respectively. 

There were 39 and
133 shares issued as a result of exercises and releases of equity awards for the 39-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015, respectively. 

There were 285 employee
stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares issued from outstanding Treasury stock during the 39-week period ended September 24, 2016. 

There were 214 ESPP
shares issued from outstanding Treasury stock during the 39-week period ended September 26, 2015. 

4.    Segment Information    

The Company has identified
five reportable segments   Auto, Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness. The Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker
(CODM) assesses segment performance and allocates resources to each segment individually. 

Net sales, gross profit,
and operating income for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below. In 2016 the Company moved action
camera related revenue and expenses from the Outdoor segment to the Auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other
camera-based efforts occurring within the Auto segment. The overall impact of the move was immaterial. However, action camera
related operating results for the 13-weeks and 39-weeks ended September 26, 2015 have been recast to conform to the current year
presentation. 

Allocation of certain
research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses are made to each segment on a percent of
revenue basis. 

Net sales and property
and equipment, net by geographic area are as follows as of and for the 39-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26,
2015. Note that APAC includes Asia Pacific and Australian Continent and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa: 

5.    Warranty Reserves    

The Company s
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years. The Company s estimate of costs
to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions and are recorded as
a liability on the balance sheet. The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve. 

6.    Commitments and Contingencies    

The Company is party
to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income
housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. The aggregate amount of
purchase orders and other commitments open as of September 24, 2016 was approximately $277,041. We cannot determine the aggregate
amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within
short periods of time. 

In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters
alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments
in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual or disclosure. The assessment regarding
whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a
series of complex judgments about future events. 

Management of the
Company currently does not believe there is at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or
a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies individually and in the aggregate, for the
fiscal quarter ended September 24, 2016. The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted
with certainty. Although management considers the likelihood to be remote, an adverse resolution of one or more of such matters
in excess of management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations
in a particular quarter or fiscal year. 

The Company settled
or resolved certain matters during the fiscal quarter ended September 24, 2016 that did not individually or in the aggregate have
a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 

7.    Income Taxes    

The Company s
income tax expense decreased from $45,592 to $24,711 for the 13-week period ended September 24, 2016, compared to the 13-week
period ended September 26, 2015.  The effective tax rate decreased to 16.5% in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 27.6%
in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to shifts in the projected income mix by jurisdiction during the third quarter of 2016
compared to the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also a result of the permanent extension of
the U.S. research and development tax credit legislation, which had not yet been extended in the third quarter of 2015. 

The Company s
income tax expense decreased from $90,800 to $86,904 for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to the first three quarters
of 2015.  The effective tax rate decreased to 18.8% for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to 21.9% in the first three
quarters of 2015 primarily due to shifts in the projected income mix by jurisdiction for 2016 compared to the projection at third
quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also a result of the permanent extension of the U.S. research and development
tax credit legislation, which had not yet been extended in the third quarter of 2015. 

8.    Marketable Securities    

The Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC topic entitled  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date (exit price). The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following
hierarchy: 

Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active
                                         markets for the identical asset or liability   

Level 2  Observable inputs for the asset or
                                         liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
                                         liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
                                         in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
                                         for the asset or liability     

Level 3  Unobservable inputs for the asset
                                         or liability  

The Company endeavors
to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation is based on prices obtained from
an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices
for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual
cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads. 

The method described
above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different
fair value measurement at the reporting date. 

Available-for-sale
securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

Marketable securities
classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below: 

(1)  Represents impairment not related
                                         to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily
                                         impaired.   

(2)  Represents unrealized losses
                                         on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.   

The Company s
investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. The fair value of the securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the
underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. The Company does not intend
to sell the securities that have a material unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the
Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. 

The Company recognizes
the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in  Other Income  and the noncredit component
in  Other comprehensive income (loss)  for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more
likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery. During 2015 and the 39-week period ending September 24, 2016,
the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. 

The amortized cost
and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at September 24, 2016 were $692,047 and $685,131 respectively.
Approximately 34.7% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at September 24, 2016. We have the ability
to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered. We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than
temporary credit losses because there has been no material deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of
the underlying securities. We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required
to sell the securities; therefore, no material impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement
of income. 

The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method. 

The following tables
display additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale
securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 24, 2016 and December 26, 2015: 

The amortized cost
and estimated fair value of marketable securities at September 24, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities
will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without
prepayment penalties. 

9.    Share Repurchase
                                         Plan  

On February 13, 2015,
the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $300,000 of the common
shares of Garmin Ltd. The repurchases may be made from time to time as market and business conditions warrant on the open market
or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC s Rule 10b-18. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will be
determined by the Company s management depending on market conditions and other factors including price, regulatory requirements
and capital availability. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued
at any time. The share repurchase authorization expires on December 31, 2016. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had repurchased
4,729 shares using cash of $196,633. There remains approximately $103,367 available to repurchase additional shares under this
authorization.

The following provides

11.    Recently
                                         Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU
2014-09 ), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or
services to a customer. The new standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or in a modified retrospective
approach in which the cumulative effect will be recognized as of the date of adoption. Additional updates to Topic 606 issued
by the FASB in 2015 and 2016 include the following: 

ASU
                                         No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
                                         Date ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of the new guidance
                                         such that the new provisions will now be required for fiscal years, and interim periods
                                         within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017     

ASU
                                         No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
                                         Considerations ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance
                                         on principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net).    

ASU
                                         No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
                                         Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ), which clarifies the implementation
                                         guidance on identifying performance obligations and classifying licensing arrangements    

ASU
                                         No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
                                         and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12 ), which clarifies the implementation
                                         guidance in a number of other areas.    

The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting the new revenue standards on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which sets out the principles
for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees
to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged
compared to the current accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment
awards. The standard includes provisions addressing income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not intend to early adopt ASU 2016-09, rather, adoption will occur
in the fiscal year ending December 30, 2017. ASU 2016-09 requires that tax effects from stock-based compensation be recognized
in the income tax provision, as these amounts are currently recognized in additional paid-in capital. The Company believes this
aspect of the standard may have a material effect on the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income in
future periods. Furthermore, under ASU 2016-09, excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified
as a cash flow from operations, rather than as a cash flow from financing activities. The Company will apply both changes prospectively.
The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of these changes due to the dependency of these items on the
underlying share price of the Company. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with
the objective of reducing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

On September 30, 2016,
the Company acquired the shares of Iiyonet, Inc., a key distributor of Garmin s consumer products in Japan. This acquisition
was not material. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The discussion set
forth below, as well as other portions of this Quarterly Report, contains statements concerning potential future events. Such
forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions by management, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, including assumptions
about risks and uncertainties faced by the Company. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such
verbs as expects, anticipates, believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of the Company s assumptions
prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by
such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but
not limited to, those factors identified in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015.
This report has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC  or the  Commission ) in
Washington, D.C. and can be obtained by contacting the SEC's public reference operations or obtaining it through the SEC's website
at http://www.sec.gov. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement
concerning the Company. The Company will not update any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report to reflect future
events or developments. 

The information contained
in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction
with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements
and notes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015. 

The Company is a leading
worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System,
or GPS, technology. We operate in five business segments, the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto and aviation markets. The Company s
segments offer products through its network of independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of products and types
of customers for the five segments may vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. 

Results of Operations  

The following table
sets forth the Company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not
foot due to rounding): 

The Company manages
its operations in five segments: outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation, and each of its segments employs the same accounting
policies. Allocation of certain research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses are made
to each segment on a percent of revenue basis. The segment table located in Note 4 sets forth the Company s results of operations
(in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company s five segments during the
periods shown. For each line item in the table, the total of the outdoor, fitness, marine, auto, and aviation segments' amounts
equals the amount in the condensed consolidated statements of income included in Item 1. 

In 2016 the Company
moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the Outdoor segment to the Auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies
with other camera-based efforts occurring within the Auto segment. The overall impact of the move was immaterial. However, action
camera related operating results for the 13-weeks and 39-weeks ended September 26, 2015 have been recast to conform to the current
year presentation. 

Comparison of 13-weeks ended September
24, 2016 and September 26, 2015   

  (Amounts included in the following
discussion are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated)  

Net Sales   

Net sales increased
6% for the 13-week period ended September 24, 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. All segments, excluding Auto grew in
the quarter. Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 30% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 40% in
the third quarter of 2015. 

Total unit sales decreased
slightly to 3,848 in the third quarter of 2016 from 3,861 in the same period of 2015.  

Auto segment revenue decreased 21% from
the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and additional revenue deferrals with certain OEM products
when compared to third quarter 2015. Revenues in our fitness segment increased 32% from the year-ago quarter on the strength of
activity trackers, running, and cycling products. Revenues in our outdoor segment increased 28% from the year-ago quarter primarily
driven by growth in our wearable category and the newly acquired DeLorme product lines. Revenues in our marine segment increased
12% from the year-ago quarter primarily due to increases in chartplotters, fish finders, and entertainment systems. Aviation revenues
increased 14% from the year-ago quarter due to growth in both OEM and Aftermarket sales. 

Cost of Goods Sold    

Cost of goods sold
decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter with decreases across all segments. In absolute
dollars third quarter 2016 cost of goods sold was $1.2 million lower than the prior year quarter, or relatively flat on a percentage
change basis. 

In the auto
segment, the decrease of 22% in cost of goods sold reflects lower PND shipments.  In the outdoor and fitness segments,
the increases of 21% and 30% in cost of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth.  In the marine
and aviation segments, the increases of 7% and 11% in cost of goods sold, respectively, reflect volume growth. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit dollars
in the third quarter of 2016 increased 12% while gross profit margin increased 290 basis points compared to the third quarter
of 2015. All segments had increases in gross margin rate. 

Advertising Expense   

Advertising expense
decreased 11% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues. The decrease in absolute dollars was primarily
in auto. 

Selling, General and Administrative
Expense   

Selling, general and
administrative expense increased 3% in absolute dollars and decreased 40 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the
year-ago quarter. The absolute dollar increase is primarily due to increased bad debt expense and IT related costs. Variances
by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of
total revenues. 

Research and Development Expense   

Research and development
expense increased 10% due to ongoing development activities for new products. In absolute dollars, research and development costs
increased $10.7 million when compared with the year-ago quarter and were stable as a percent of revenue. Our research and development
spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories. 

Operating Income   

Operating income increased
27% in absolute dollars and 360 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase
in operating income is due to revenue growth and an improved gross margin percentage partially offset by an increase in operating
expense. 

Other Income (Expense)    

The average return
on cash and investments during the third quarter of 2016 was 1.5% compared to 1.1% during the same quarter of 2015. Higher interest
income in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, is attributable to an increased rate of return on
investments. 

Foreign
currency gains and losses of the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar and the Euro in relation to
the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation. The U.S. Dollar is the functional
currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd. The Euro is the functional currency of most other European subsidiaries. The majority of the
Company s consolidated foreign currency gains or losses results from the exchange rate impact on the significant cash,
receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the Company s subsidiaries.
Currency fluctuations related to currencies other than the Taiwan Dollar and the Euro are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements.  

The $19.4 million
currency loss in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar. During
the third quarter of 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $20.9 million, while
the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.0% against the Euro, resulting in a gain of $2.6 million. The remaining net currency loss of $1.1 million
is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 

The $30.6 million
currency gain in the third quarter 2015 was due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar while the U.S. Dollar
weakened slightly against the Euro. During the third quarter of 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 6.5% compared to the Taiwan
Dollar resulting in a gain of $41.1 million while the U.S. Dollar weakened 0.1% against the Euro resulting in a gain of $0.3 million.
The remaining net currency loss of $10.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 

Income Tax Provision

The Company s
income tax expense decreased from $45.6 million to $24.7 million for the 13-week period ended September 24, 2016, compared to
the 13-week period ended September 26, 2015. The effective tax rate decreased to 16.5% in the third quarter of 2016, compared
to 27.6% in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to shifts in the projected income mix by jurisdiction during the third quarter
of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also a result of the permanent extension
of the U.S. research and development tax credit legislation, which had not yet been extended in the third quarter of 2015. 

Net Income    

As a result of the
above, net income for the 13-weeks ended September 24, 2016 was $125.1 million compared to $119.3 million for the 13-week period
ended September 26, 2015, an increase of $5.8 million. 

Comparison of 39-Weeks Ended September
24, 2016 and September 26, 2015  

  (Amounts included in the following
discussion are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated)  

Net Sales   

Net sales increased
6% for the 39-week period ended September 24, 2016 when compared to the prior year period. All segments had an increase in revenue
except for auto. Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 30% in the first three quarters of 2016 compared
to 39% in the first three quarters of 2015. 

Total unit sales increased
3% to 11,374 in the first three quarters of 2016 from 11,055 in the same period of 2015. 

Auto segment revenue decreased 17% from
the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and additional revenue deferrals with certain OEM products
when compared to first three quarters of 2015. Outdoor revenue increased 27% primarily driven by growth in our wearables and the
newly acquired DeLorme product lines. Fitness revenues increased 26% due to growth of our activity tracker, running, and cycling
categories. Revenues in our marine segment increased 15% primarily due to increases in chartplotters, fish finders, and entertainment
systems compared to the first three quarters of 2015. Aviation revenues increased 9% from the year-ago period due to growth in
both OEM and Aftermarket sales. 

Cost of Goods
Sold   

Cost of goods sold
increased 4% in absolute dollars for the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the year ago period. 

In the auto segment,
the cost of goods decline reflects lower PND shipments. In the outdoor and fitness segments, the increases of 26% and 35% in cost
of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth. In the marine and aviation segments, the increases of 14%
and 5% in cost of goods sold, respectively, reflect volume growth. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit dollars
in the first three quarters of 2016 increased 7% while gross profit margin increased 80 basis points compared to the first three
quarters of 2015. Fitness margin declined to 54% due to product mix. All other segment gross margin rates are relatively consistent
between the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the first three quarters of 2015. 

Advertising Expense   

Advertising expense
decreased 1% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago period. The decrease
in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to auto partially offset by fitness and outdoor. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses   

Selling, general and
administrative expense increased 2% in absolute dollars and decreased 50 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the
year-ago period. The absolute dollar increase is primarily due to increased bad debt expense and IT related costs. Variances by
segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total
revenues. 

Research and Development Expense   

Research and development
expense increased 6% due to ongoing development activities for new products. In absolute dollars, research and development costs
increased $18.0 million when compared with the year-ago period and remained relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared
to the year-ago period. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities,
and exploring new categories. 

Operating Income   

Operating income increased
15% in absolute dollars and 170 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago period. Revenue growth with
a relatively flat gross margin percentage contributed to the growth, slightly offset by increased operating expenses, as discussed
above. 

Other Income (Expense)   

The average return
on cash and investments during the first three quarters of 2016 was 1.4% compared to 1.2% during the same period of 2015. The
increase in interest income is attributable to an increased rate of return on investments. 

The $30.0 million
currency loss in the first three quarters of 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar.
During the first three quarters of 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 5.0% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $32.1
million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.3% against the Euro, resulting in a gain of $3.3 million. The remaining net currency
loss of $1.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 

The majority of the
$14.2 million currency loss in the first three quarters of 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against both the
Euro and the Taiwan Dollar. During the first three quarters of 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.2% compared to the Euro resulting
in a loss of $24.7 million while strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar by 4.1% resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. The remaining
net currency loss of $10.1 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. 

Income Tax Provision

The Company s
income tax expense decreased from $90.8 million to $86.9 million for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to the first three
quarters of 2015.  The effective tax rate decreased to 18.8% for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to 21.9% in the
first three quarters of 2015 primarily due to shifts in the projected income mix by jurisdiction for 2016 compared to the
projection at third quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also a result of the permanent extension of the
U.S. research and development tax credit legislation, which had not yet been extended in the third quarter of 2015. 

Net Income    

Net income for the
39-week period ended September 24, 2016 was $374.2 million compared to $323.8 million for the 39-week period ended September 26,
2015, an increase of $50.4 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Operating Activities   

The $370.2 million
increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the first three quarters of 2015
was primarily due to the following: 

the
                                         impact of income taxes payable providing $170.2 million more cash, primarily related
                                         to the timing of 2015 income tax payments associated with the inter-company restructuring
                                         that was announced in the third quarter of 2014     

other
                                         current and noncurrent assets providing $114.1 million more cash primarily related to
                                         the timing of payments for royalties     

inventories
                                         providing $70.0 million more cash primarily due to reduced purchases of raw materials

net
                                         income increasing $50.4 million as discussed in the Results of Operations section above    

other
                                         current and noncurrent liabilities providing $46.6 million more cash primarily due to
                                         timing of payments for royalties and    

deferred revenue providing $36.1 million more working capital benefit due to the net decrease in amortization
of previously deferred revenue and additional revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM products    

Partially offset
by: 

accounts
                                         payable providing $57.6 million less cash primarily due to the timing of purchases    

accounts
                                         receivable providing $47.5 million less working capital benefit primarily due to the
                                         net decrease in utilization of rebates receivable associated with royalties, partially
                                         offset by increased collections of trade receivables and    

Investing Activities   

The $78.7 million
decrease in cash provided by investing activities in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to first three quarters of 2015
was primarily due to the following: 

decreased
                                         net redemptions of marketable securities of $37.8 million and    

increased
                                         cash payments for acquisitions of $49.5 million    

Partially offset
by: 

decreased
                                         purchases of property and equipment of $11.1 million    

It is management s
goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of
each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash. The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain
an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin s average returns
on cash and investments during first three quarters of 2016 and 2015 were approximately 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively. 

Financing Activities   

The $35.6 million
decrease in cash used in financing activities in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to first three quarters of 2015 was
primarily due to the following: 

decreased
                                         purchases of treasury stock of $42.8 million under our share repurchase authorization    

Partially offset
by: 

increased
                                         dividend payments of $8.1 million due to the year-over-year increase of our dividend
                                         rate    

We currently use cash
flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, to pay dividends, and to fund
share repurchases. We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment
of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances
and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other
cash requirements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  

There are numerous market risks that can

About Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015. There have been no material
changes during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 24, 2016 in the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
related to market sensitivity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)  Evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures.  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to
management in a timely fashion.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. As of September 24, 2016, the Company
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
as of September 24, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to the
Company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)  Changes in internal control over
financial reporting . There has been no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred
during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 24, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters
involving patent infringement, other intellectual property, product liability, customer claims and various other risks. It is
not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of
these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company s management does not expect that the results
in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There
are many risks and uncertainties that can affect our future business, financial performance or share price. In addition to the
other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26,      2015,
as amended and supplemented by the risk factor set forth below. These risks, however, are not the only risks facing our Company.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.   

The following is an
amended and restated version of a Risk Factor included in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 26, 2015: 

Economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty
could adversely affect our revenue and margins.  

Our revenue and margins
depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness
or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in
decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial
difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad
debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The United Kingdom
(UK) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (EU). Due to the unprecedented
nature of the proposed withdrawal, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the timing and terms of the proposed exit. We have
operations in the UK and several EU member states whose currencies, namely British Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro, economies, taxation,
and trade regulation, among other factors, could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the UK s leaving
the EU, which is likely to be a lengthy and complicated process. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business
operations, results of operations and financial condition.

423 and for purposes of the Code shall be treated as separate and apart from the balance of the Plan.

of the Company, the Board shall make such adjustment, if any, as it deems appropriate in the number, kind and purchase price of
the Shares available for purchase under the Plan. In the event that, at a time when options are outstanding hereunder, there occurs
a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, except pursuant to a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, each
option to purchase Shares shall terminate, but the Participant holding such option shall have the right to exercise his or her
option prior to such termination of the option upon the dissolution or liquidation. The Company reserves the right to reduce the
number of Shares which Employees may purchase pursuant to their enrollment in the Plan. 

V.           Eligibility Requirements  

5.1           Except
as provided in Section 5.2, each individual who is an Eligible Employee of the Company or a Participating Subsidiary on the applicable
Cut-Off Date shall become eligible to participate in the Plan in accordance with Article VI as of the first Enrollment Date following
the date the individual becomes an Employee of the Company or a Participating Subsidiary, provided that the individual remains
an Eligible Employee on the first day of the Accumulation Period associated with such Enrollment Date. Participation in the Plan
is entirely voluntary. 

5.2           Employees
meeting any of the following restrictions are not eligible to participate in the Plan:

upon enrollment in the Plan or upon grant of an Option would own directly or indirectly, or hold options or rights to acquire,
an aggregate of 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary (and for purposes of this paragraph, the rules of Code Section 424(d) shall apply, and stock which the
Employee may purchase under outstanding options shall be treated as stock owned by the Employee); 

(b)          Employees
(other than individuals on Authorized Leave of Absence (as defined in Section 10.3)) who are customarily employed by the Company
or a Participating Subsidiary for not more than 20 hours per week; or 

(c)          Employees (other than
individuals on Authorized Leave of Absence (as defined in Section 10.3)) who are customarily employed by the Company or a Participating
Subsidiary for not more than five (5) months in any calendar year. 

5.3           The
Plan is intended to conform to the extent necessary with all provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any and
all regulations and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Plan shall be administered, and the options shall be granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to
conform to such laws, rules and regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and the options granted hereunder
shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations. 

VI.           Enrollment  

6.1           Eligible
Employees will be automatically enrolled in the Plan on the first day of each Accumulation Period. Any Eligible Employee may consent
to enrollment in the Plan for an Accumulation Period by completing and signing an enrollment form (which authorizes payroll deductions
during such Accumulation Period in accordance with Section 8.1) and submitting such enrollment form to the Company or the Participating
Subsidiary on or before the Cut-Off Date specified by the Administrator. Payroll deductions pursuant to the enrollment form shall
be effective as of the first payroll period with a pay day after the Enrollment Date for the Accumulation Period to which the enrollment
form relates, and shall continue in effect until the earliest of: 

(a)          the end of the last payroll
period with a payday in the Accumulation Period; 

(b)          the
date during the Accumulation Period as of which the Employee elects to cease his or her enrollment in accordance with Section 8.3;
and 

(c)          the
date during the Accumulation Period as of which the Employee withdraws from the Plan or has a termination of employment in accordance
with Article X. 

VII.          Grant
of Options on Enrollment  

7.1           The
automatic enrollment by an Eligible Employee in the Plan as of an Enrollment Date will constitute the grant as of such Enrollment
Date by the Company to such Participant of an option to purchase Shares from the Company pursuant to the Plan. 

7.2           An
option granted to a Participant pursuant to this Plan shall expire, if not terminated earlier for any reason, on the earliest to
occur of: (a) the end of the Purchase Date with respect to the Accumulation Period in which such option was granted; (b) the
completion of the purchase of Shares under the option under Article IX; or (c) the date on which participation of such Participant
in the Plan terminates for any reason. 

7.3           As
of each Enrollment Date, each Participant shall automatically be granted an option to purchase a maximum number of Shares, subject
to the terms of the Plan, equal to the quotient of $ 25,000  divided by the Fair Market Value
of a Share on the Enrollment Date. 

7.4           Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan, no Employee may be granted an option which permits his or her rights to purchase Shares under
the Plan and any other Code Section 423 employee stock purchase plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or parent companies
to accrue (when the option first becomes exercisable) at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair Market Value of such Shares (determined
at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time. For purposes of administering
this accrual limitation, the Administrator shall limit purchases under the Plan as follows: 

(a)          The
number of Shares that may be purchasable by an Employee during his or her first Accumulation Period during a calendar year may
not exceed a number of Shares determined by dividing $25,000 by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Enrollment Date for that
Accumulation Period. 

(b)          The
number of Shares that may be purchasable by an Employee during any subsequent Accumulation Period during the same calendar year
(if any) shall not exceed the number of Shares determined by performing the calculation below: 

(i)          First,
the number of Shares purchased by the Employee during any previous Accumulation Period during the same calendar year shall be multiplied
by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Enrollment Date of such previous Accumulation Period. 

(ii)         Second,
the amount determined under (i) above shall be subtracted from $25,000. 

(iii)        Third,
the amount determined under (ii) above shall be divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Enrollment Date for such subsequent
Accumulation Period (for which the maximum number of Shares purchasable is being determined by this calculation) occurs. The quotient
thus obtained shall be the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased by any Employee for such subsequent Accumulation Period.

VIII.          Payroll
Deductions  

8.1           An
Employee who files an enrollment form pursuant to Article VI shall elect and authorize in such form to have deductions made from
his or her pay on each payday he or she receives a paycheck during the Accumulation Period to which the enrollment form relates,
and he or she shall designate in such form the percentage (in whole percentages) of Base Earnings to be deducted each payday during
such Accumulation Period. The minimum an Employee may elect and authorize to have deducted is 1% of his or her Base Earnings paid
per pay period in such Accumulation Period, and the maximum is 10% of his or her Base Earnings paid per pay period in such Accumulation
Period (or such larger or smaller percentage as the Administrator may designate from time to time). 

8.2           Except
as provided in the last paragraph of Section 6.1, deductions from a Participant s Base Earnings shall commence upon the first
payday on or after the commencement of the Accumulation Period, and shall continue until the date on which such authorization ceases
to be effective in accordance with Article VI. The amount of each deduction made for a Participant shall be credited to the Participant s
Account. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company or a Participating Subsidiary may be, but are not required to be,
used by the Company or Participating Subsidiary for any corporate purpose, and the Company or Participating Subsidiary shall not
be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions, but may do so at the discretion of the Board. 

8.3           As
of the last day of any month during an Accumulation Period, a Participant may elect to cease (but not to increase or decrease)
payroll deductions made on his or her behalf for the remainder of such Accumulation Period by filing the applicable election with
the Company or Participating Subsidiary in such form and manner and at such time as may be permitted by the Administrator. A Participant
who has ceased payroll deductions may have the amount which was credited to his or her Account prior to such cessation applied
to the purchase of Shares as of the Purchase Date, in accordance with Section 9.1, and receive the balance of the Account with
respect to which the enrollment is ceased, if any, in cash. A Participant who has ceased payroll deductions may also voluntarily
withdraw from the Plan pursuant to Section 10.1. Any Participant who ceases payroll deductions for an Accumulation Period may re-enroll
in the Plan on the next subsequent Enrollment Date following the cessation in accordance with the provisions of Article VI. A Participant
who ceases to be employed by the Company or any Participating Subsidiary will cease to be a Participant in accordance with Section
10.2. 

8.4           A
Participant may not make any separate or additional contributions to his Account under the Plan. Neither the Company nor any Participating
Subsidiary shall make separate or additional contributions to any Participant s Account under the Plan. 

IX.           Purchase
of Shares  

9.1           Subject
to Section 9.2, any option held by the Participant which was granted under this Plan and which remains outstanding as of a Purchase
Date shall be deemed to have been exercised on such Purchase Date for the purchase of the number of whole Shares which the funds
accumulated in his or her Account as of the Purchase Date will purchase at the applicable purchase price (but not in excess of
the number of Shares for which options have been granted to the Participant pursuant to Section 7.3). No Shares will be purchased
on behalf of any Participant who fails to file an enrollment form authorizing payroll deductions for an Accumulation Period. 

9.2           A
Participant who holds an outstanding option as of a Purchase Date shall not be deemed to have exercised such option if the Participant
elected not to exercise the option by withdrawing from the Plan in accordance with Section 10.1. 

9.3           If,
after a Participant s exercise of an option under Section 9.1, an amount remains credited to the Participant s Account
as of a Purchase Date, then the remaining amount shall be distributed to the Participant in cash as soon as administratively practical
after such Purchase Date. 

9.4           Except
as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.4, the purchase price for each Share purchased under any option shall be 85% of the lower
of: 

(a)          the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the Enrollment Date on which such option is granted; or 

(b)          the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the Purchase Date, but - in the case of newly issued Shares - not lower than the par value of a
Share. 

Notwithstanding the above, the Board may establish a different
purchase price for each Share purchased under any option provided that such purchase price is determined at least thirty (30) days
prior to the Accumulation Period for which it is applicable and provided that such purchase price may not be less than (i) the
purchase price set forth above and (ii)   in the case of newly issued Shares - than the par value per Share. 

9.5           If
Shares are purchased by a Participant pursuant to Section 9.1, then such Shares shall be held in non-certificated form at a bank
or other appropriate institution selected by the Administrator until the earlier of the Participant s termination of employment
or the time a Participant requests delivery of certificates representing such shares, which would only be possible if the Board
resolved that share certificates shall be issued. If any law governing corporate or securities matters, or any applicable regulation
of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other body having jurisdiction with respect to such matters, shall require that the
Company or the Participant take any action in connection with the Shares being purchased under the option, delivery of such Shares
shall be postponed until the necessary action shall have been completed, which action shall be taken by the Company at its own
expense, without unreasonable delay. 

Shares transferred pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be registered
in the name of the Participant or, if the Participant so elects, in the names of the Participant and one or more such other persons
as may be designated by the Participant in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship or in tenancy by the entireties or as spousal
community property, or in such forms of trust as may be approved by the Administrator, to the extent permitted by law. 

9.6           In
the case of Participants employed by a Participating Subsidiary, the Board may provide for Shares to be sold through the Subsidiary
to such Participants, to the extent consistent with and governed by Section 423 of the Code. 

9.7           If
the total number of Shares for which an option is exercised on any Purchase Date in accordance with this Article IX, when aggregated
with all Shares previously granted under this Plan, exceeds the maximum number of Shares reserved in Section 4.1, the Administrator
shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares available for delivery and distribution in as nearly a uniform manner as shall be
practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable, and the balance of the cash amount credited to the Account of each Participant
under the Plan shall be returned to him or her as promptly as administratively practical. 

9.8           If
a Participant or former Participant sells, transfers, or otherwise makes a disposition of Shares purchased pursuant to an option
granted under the Plan within two years after the date such option is granted or within one year after the Purchase Date to which
such option relates, or if the Participant or former Participant otherwise has a taxable event relating to Shares purchased under
the Plan, and if such Participant or former Participant is subject to U.S. federal income tax, then such Participant or former
Participant shall notify the Company or Participating Subsidiary in writing of any such sale, transfer or other disposition within
10 days of the consummation of such sale, transfer or other disposition, and shall remit to the Company or Participating Subsidiary
or authorize the Company or Participating Subsidiary to withhold from other sources such amount as the Company may determine to
be necessary to satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligations of the Company or Participating Subsidiary. A Participant
must reply to a written request, within 10 days of the receipt of such written request, from the Company, Participating Subsidiary,
or Administrator regarding whether such a sale, transfer or other disposition has occurred. 

The Administrator may from time to time
establish rules and procedures (including but not limited to postponing delivery of Shares until the earlier of the expiration
of the two-year or one-year period or the disposition of such Shares by the Participant) to cause the withholding requirements
to be satisfied. 

X.             Withdrawal From the Plan; Termination
of Employment; Leave of Absence; Death  

10.1          Withdrawal
from the Plan . Effective as of the last day of any calendar quarter during an Accumulation Period, a Participant may withdraw
from the Plan in full (but not in part) by delivering a notice of withdrawal to the Company (in a manner prescribed by the Administrator)
at least ten business days prior to the end of such calendar quarter (but in no event later than the June 1 or December 1 immediately
preceding the Purchase Date for the Plan's two Accumulation Periods, respectively). Upon such withdrawal from participation in
the Plan, all funds then accumulated in the Participant s Account shall not be used to purchase Shares, but shall instead
be distributed to the Participant as soon as administratively practical after the end of such calendar quarter, and the Participant s
payroll deductions shall cease as of the end of such calendar quarter. An Employee who has withdrawn during an Accumulation Period
may not return funds to the Company or a Participating Subsidiary during the same Accumulation Period and require the Company or
Participating Subsidiary to apply those funds to the purchase of Shares, nor may such Participant s payroll deductions continue,
in accordance with Article VI. Any Eligible Employee who has withdrawn from the Plan may, however, re-enroll in the Plan on the
next subsequent Enrollment Date following withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of Article VI. 

10.2          Termination
of Employment . Participation in the Plan terminates immediately when a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or
any Participating Subsidiary for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to termination of employment, whether voluntary
or involuntary, or on account of disability, or retirement, but not including death, or if the participating Subsidiary employing
the Participant ceases for any reason to be a Participating Subsidiary. Participation in the Plan also terminates immediately when
a Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee under Article V or withdraws from the Plan. Upon termination of participation such
terminated Participant s outstanding options shall thereupon terminate. As soon as administratively practical after termination
of participation, the Company shall pay to the Participant or legal representative all amounts accumulated in the Participant s
Account and held by the Company at the time of termination of participation, and any Participating Subsidiary shall pay to the
Participant or legal representative all amounts accumulated in the Participant's Account and held by the Participating Subsidiary
at the time of termination of participation. 

10.3          Leaves
of Absence . 

(a)          If a Participant takes a leave of
absence (other than an Authorized Leave of Absence) without terminating employment, such Participant will be deemed to have discontinued
contributions to the Plan in accordance with Section 8.3, but will remain a Participant in the Plan through the balance of the
Accumulation Period in which his or her leave of absence begins, so long as such leave of absence does not exceed 90 days. If a
Participant takes a leave of absence (other than an Authorized Leave of Absence) without terminating employment, such Participant
will be deemed to have withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section 10.1 if such leave of absence exceeds 90 days. 

(b)          An Employee on an Authorized Leave
of Absence shall remain a Participant in the Plan and, in the case of a paid Authorized Leave of Absence, shall have deductions
made under Section 8.1 from payments that would, but for the Authorized Leave of Absence, be Base Earnings. An Employee who does
not return from an Authorized Leave of Absence on the scheduled date (or, in the case of Qualified Military Leave, prior to the
date such individual s reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 have
expired or terminated) shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the last day of such Authorized Leave of Absence (or, in
the case of Qualified Military Leave, the date such reemployment rights expire or are terminated). 

(c)            An  Authorized Leave of Absence 
means (a) a Qualified Military Leave, and (b) an Employee s absence of more than 90 days which has been authorized, either
pursuant to a policy of the Company or the Participating Subsidiary that employs the Employee, or pursuant to a written agreement
between the employer and the Employee, which policy or written agreement guarantees the Employee s rights to return to employment. 

10.4          Death .
Unless mandatory applicable law provides otherwise as soon as administratively feasible after the death of a Participant, amounts
accumulated in his or her Account shall be paid in cash to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant on a
beneficiary designation form approved by the Board, but if the Participant does not make an effective beneficiary designation then
such amounts shall be paid in cash to the Participant s spouse if the Participant has a spouse, or, if the Participant does
not have a spouse, to the executor, administrator or other legal representative of the Participant s estate. Such payment
shall relieve the Company and the Participating Subsidiary of further liability with respect to the Plan on account of the deceased
Participant. If more than one beneficiary is designated, each beneficiary shall receive an equal portion of the Account unless
the Participant has given express contrary instructions. None of the Participant s beneficiary, spouse, executor, administrator
or other legal representative of the Participant s estate shall, prior to the death of the Participant by whom he has been
designated, acquire any interest in the amounts credited to the Participant s Account under the Plan. 

XI.           Miscellaneous  

11.1          Interest .
Interest or earnings will not be paid on any Employee Accounts. 

11.2          Restrictions
on Transfer . The rights of a Participant under the Plan shall not be assignable or transferable by such Participant, and an
option granted under the Plan may not be exercised during a Participant s lifetime other than by the Participant. Any such
attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act
as an election to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section 10.1. 

11.3          Administrative
Assistance . If the Administrator in its discretion so elects, it may retain a brokerage firm, bank, other financial institution
or other appropriate agent to assist in the purchase of Shares, delivery of reports or other administrative aspects of the Plan.
If the Administrator so elects, each Participant shall (unless prohibited by applicable law) be deemed upon enrollment in the Plan
to have authorized the establishment of an account on his or her behalf at such institution. Shares purchased by a Participant
under the Plan shall be held in the account in the Participant s name, or if the Participant so indicates in the enrollment
form, in the Participant s name together with the name of one or more other persons in joint tenancy with right of survivorship
or in tenancy by the entireties or as spousal community property, or in such forms of trust as may be approved by the Administrator,
to the extent permitted by law. 

11.4          Costs .
All costs and expenses incurred in administering the Plan shall be paid by the Company or Participating Subsidiaries, including
any brokerage fees on the purchased Shares; excepting that any stamp duties, transfer taxes, fees to issue stock certificates,
and any brokerage fees on the sale price applicable to participation in the Plan after the initial purchase of the Shares on the
Purchase Date shall be charged to the Account or brokerage account of such Participant. 

11.5          Equal
Rights and Privileges . All Eligible Employees shall have equal rights and privileges with respect to the Plan so that the Plan
qualifies as an  employee stock purchase plan  within the meaning of Section 423 or any successor provision of the
Code and the related regulations. Notwithstanding the express terms of the Plan, any provision of the Plan which is inconsistent
with Section 423 or any successor provision of the Code shall without further act or amendment by the Company or the Board
be reformed to comply with the requirements of Code Section 423. This Section 11.5 shall take precedence over all other
provisions in the Plan. 

11.6          Applicable
Law . The Plan shall be governed by the substantive laws (excluding the conflict of laws rules) of the State of Kansas. 

11.7          Amendment
and Termination . The Board may amend, alter or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no amendment which would
amend or modify the Plan in a manner requiring stockholder approval under Code Section 423 or the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Shares are traded shall be effective unless, within one year after it is adopted by the Board, it is approved
by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company s outstanding shares. In addition, the Committee (if appointed
under Section 3.1) may amend the Plan as provided in Section 3.3, subject to the conditions set forth therein and in this Section
11.7. 

If the Plan is terminated, the Board may
elect to terminate all outstanding options either prior to their expiration or upon completion of the purchase of Shares on the
next Purchase Date, or may elect to permit options to expire in accordance with the terms of this Plan (and participation to continue
through such expiration dates). If the options are terminated prior to expiration, all funds accumulated in Participants 
Accounts as of the date the options are terminated shall be returned to the Participants as soon as administratively feasible. 

11.8          No
Right of Employment . Neither the grant nor the exercise of any rights to purchase Shares under this Plan nor anything in this
Plan shall impose upon the Company or Participating Subsidiary any obligation to employ or continue to employ any employee. The
right of the Company or Participating Subsidiary to terminate any employee shall not be diminished or affected because any rights
to purchase Shares have been granted to such employee. 

11.9          Requirements
of Law . The Company shall not be required to sell, issue, or deliver any Shares under this Plan if such sale, issuance, or
delivery might constitute a violation by the Company or the Participant of any provision of law. Unless a registration statement
under the Securities Act is in effect with respect to the Shares proposed to be delivered under the Plan, the Company shall not
be required to issue such Shares if, in the opinion of the Company or its counsel, such issuance would violate the Securities Act.
Regardless of whether such Shares have been registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under the securities
laws of any state, the Company may impose restrictions upon the hypothecation or further sale or transfer of such shares if, in
the judgment of the Company or its counsel, such restrictions are necessary or desirable to achieve compliance with the provisions
of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law or are otherwise in the best interests of the Company.
Any determination by the Company or its counsel in connection with any of the foregoing shall be final and binding on all parties. 

The Company may, but shall not be obligated
to, register or qualify any securities covered by the Plan. The Company shall not be obligated to take any other affirmative action
in order to cause the grant or exercise of any right or the issuance, sale, or deliver of Shares pursuant to the exercise of any
right to comply with any law. 

11.10          Gender .
When used herein, masculine terms shall be deemed to include the feminine, except when the context indicates to the contrary. 

11.11.         Data Protection . The Board,
the Committee, and any other person or entity empowered by the Board or the Committee to administer the Plan may process, store,
transfer or disclose personal data of the Participants to the extent required for the implementation and administration of the
Plan. The Board, the Committee and any other person or entity empowered by the Board or the Committee to administer the Restated
Plan shall comply with any applicable data protection laws. 

11.12          Withholding
of Taxes . The Company or Participating Subsidiary may withhold from any purchase of Shares under this Plan or any sale, transfer
or other disposition thereof any local, state, federal or foreign taxes, employment taxes, social taxes or other taxes at such
times and from such other amounts as it deems appropriate. The Company or Participating Subsidiary may require the Participant
to remit an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any required withholding amounts to the Company or Participating Subsidiary, as
the case may be.

the shares of Garmin Cayman were exchanged for shares of the Company and the Company became the public holding company of Garmin
Cayman and its subsidiaries. The Plan was amended and restated again on June 7, 2013 and on October 21, 2016.   

1.2.   Objectives of the Plan . The Plan is intended to allow employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to acquire or increase equity ownership in the Company, or to be compensated under the Plan based on growth in the Company's equity
value, thereby strengthening their commitment to the success of the Company and stimulating their efforts on behalf of the Company,
and to assist the Company and its Subsidiaries in attracting new employees and retaining existing employees. The Plan is also intended
to optimize the profitability and growth of the Company through incentives which are consistent with the Company's goals; to provide
incentives for excellence in individual performance; and to promote teamwork.   

1.3.   Duration of the Plan . The Plan shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in

Article
4. Shares Subject to the Plan 

4.1.   Number of Shares Available .   

(a)   Plan Limit . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the number of Shares hereby
reserved for delivery under the Plan is thirteen million (13,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Shares that may be delivered
pursuant to the exercise of Options (including incentive stock options under Code Section 422) or SARs is ten million (10,000,000
Shares. The maximum number of Shares that may be delivered as Restricted Shares or pursuant to Performance Units or Restricted
Stock Units is six million (6,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Bonus Shares that may be awarded is one million (1,000,000)
Shares. If any Shares subject to an Award granted hereunder are forfeited or an Award or any portion thereof otherwise terminates
or is settled without the issuance of Shares, the Shares subject to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture, termination
or settlement, shall again be available for grant under the Plan. The Board may from time to time determine the appropriate methodology
for calculating the number of Shares issued pursuant to the Plan.   

(b)   Individual Limit . No individual Grantee may be granted Options, SARs, Restricted Shares,
Restricted Stock Units, Bonus Shares, Performance Units or Performance Shares in Shares, or in any combination thereof, relating
to an aggregate number of Shares under the Plan that exceeds two million (2,000,000) Shares in any 5-year period. If a previously
granted Option, SAR, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, or Performance Share is forfeited, canceled or repriced, such forfeited,
canceled or repriced Award as the case may be, shall continue to be counted against the maximum number of Shares subject to Awards
that may be delivered to any Grantee under this Section 4.1(b).   

4.2.   Adjustments in Shares .   

(a)   Adjustment Principle . In the event that the Board determines that any dividend or other
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, share split, reverse
share split, subdivision, consolidation or reduction of capital, reorganization, merger, scheme of arrangement, split-up, spin-off
or combination involving the Company or repurchase or exchange of Shares or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities
of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that any adjustment is determined by the
Board to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available
under the Plan, then the Board shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of
Shares (or other securities or property of the Company or any Person that is a party to a Reorganization Transaction with the Company)
with respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property of the Company
or any Person that is a party to a Reorganization Transaction with the Company) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant
or exercise price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding
Award or the substitution of other property for Shares subject to an outstanding Award; provided, that the number of Shares subject
to any Award denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number.   

(b)   Example . By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, the following illustrates
how the foregoing adjustment principles would apply in the context of a stock split: Assume a Grantee holds an Option to purchase
1,000 shares of Company stock at an Option Price of $50 per share. Assume further that the Company completes a two-for-one share
split such that every shareholder on the requisite record date receives two Shares for every one Share held on the record date.
Pursuant to the adjustment principles set forth above in Section 4.2(a), the Grantee's Option would be adjusted such that, after
such adjustment, the Grantee would hold an Option to purchase 2,000 Shares at an Option Price of $25 per Share. All other terms
and conditions of the Option would remain the same. Similar adjustment principles would apply to SARs, Performance Shares, Performance
Units, Bonus Shares and Deferred Shares. This Section 4.2(b) is for illustrative purposes only, assumes hypothetical facts, and
shall not, under any event or circumstance, be interpreted as the adjustment outcome with respect to specific factual situations.

targets, and goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures; 

(xx)
         Achievement of business or operational goals such as market share and/or business development; and/or

provided that
applicable Business Criteria may be applied on a pre- or post-tax basis; and provided further that the Plan Committee may, when
the applicable performance goals are established, provide that the formula for such goals may include or exclude items to measure
specific objectives, such as losses from discontinued operations, extraordinary gains or losses, the cumulative effect of accounting
changes, acquisitions or divestitures, foreign exchange impacts and any unusual, nonrecurring gain or loss. As established by the
Plan Committee, the Business Criteria may include, without limitation, GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the
foregoing performance goals, the performance goals shall also include any performance goals which are set forth in a Company bonus
or incentive plan, if any, which has been approved by the Company's shareholders, which are incorporated herein by reference. Such

in absolute or relative levels and may be based upon a set increase, set positive result, maintenance of the status quo, set decrease
or set negative result. Business Criteria may differ for Awards to different Grantees. The Plan Committee shall specify the weighting
(which may be the same or different for multiple objectives) to be given to each performance objective for purposes of determining
the final amount payable with respect to any such Award. Any one or more of the Business Criteria may apply to a Grantee, to the
Company as a whole, to one or more Subsidiaries or to a department, unit, division or function within the Company, within any one
or more Subsidiaries or any one or more joint ventures of which the Company is a party, and may apply either alone or relative
to the performance of other businesses or individuals (including industry or general market indices).   

(e)   Discretion to Adjust . The Plan Committee shall have the discretion to adjust the determinations
of the degree of attainment of the pre-established performance goals; provided, however, that Awards which are designed to qualify
for the performance-based exception under Code Section 162(m) may not (unless the Plan Committee determines to amend the Award
so that it no longer qualifies for such performance-based exception) be adjusted upward. The Plan Committee shall retain the discretion
to adjust such Awards downward. The Plan Committee may not, unless the Plan Committee determines to amend the Award so that it
no longer qualifies for the performance-based exception, delegate any responsibility with respect to Awards intended to qualify
for such performance-based exception. All determinations by the Plan Committee as to the achievement of the Business Criteria shall
be certified in writing prior to payment of the Award.   

(f)   Alteration of Performance Measures . In the event that applicable laws allow an Award to
qualify for the performance-based exception to Code Section 162(m) even if the Plan Committee alters the governing Business Criteria
without obtaining shareholder approval, the Plan Committee shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining shareholder
approval.

6. Stock Options 

6.1.   Grant of Options . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted
to any Eligible Person in such number, and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the
Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may grant to any Eligible Person, or permit any Eligible Person
to elect to receive, an Option in lieu of or in substitution for any other compensation (whether payable currently or on a deferred
basis, and whether payable under the Plan or otherwise) which such Eligible Person may be eligible to receive from the Company
or a Subsidiary, which Option may have a value (as determined by the Board under Black-Scholes or any other option valuation method)
that is equal to or greater than the amount of such other compensation.   

6.2.   Award Agreement . Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify
the Option Price, the Option Term, the number of shares to which the Option pertains, the time or times at which such Option shall
be exercisable and such other provisions as the Board shall determine.   

6.3.   Option Price . The Option Price of an Option under the Plan shall be determined by the Board,
and shall be the higher of 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date or 100% of the par value of a Share;  provided,
however , that any Option ( Substitute Option ) that is (x) granted to a Grantee in connection with the acquisition
( Acquisition ), however effected, by the Company of another corporation or entity ( Acquired Entity ) or the
assets thereof, (y) associated with an option to purchase shares of stock or other equity interest of the Acquired Entity or an
affiliate thereof ( Acquired Entity Option ) held by such Grantee immediately prior to such Acquisition, and (z) intended
to preserve for the Grantee the economic value of all or a portion of such Acquired Entity Option, shall be granted such that such
option substitution is completed in conformity with the rules set forth in Section 424(a) of the Code.   

6.4.   Grant of Incentive Stock Options .   

(a)  At the time of the grant of any Option to an Eligible Person who is an employee of the Company
or a Subsidiary, the Board may designate that such option shall be made subject to additional restrictions to permit it to qualify
as an  incentive stock option  under the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Any option designated as an incentive
stock option:   

(i)  shall not be granted to a person who owns shares (including shares treated as owned under Section
424(d) of the Code) possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company;   

(ii)  shall be for a term of not more than 10 years from the Grant Date, and shall be subject to earlier
termination as provided herein or in the applicable Award Agreement;   

(iii)  shall not have an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined for each incentive stock option at its
Grant Date) of Shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by such Grantee during any
calendar year (under the Plan and any other employee stock option plan of the Grantee's employer or any parent or Subsidiary thereof
( Other Plans )), determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, which exceeds $100,000 (the
 $100,000 Limit    

(iv)  shall, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of a Share (determined on the Grant Date) with respect
to the portion of such grant which is exercisable for the first time during any calendar year ( Current Grant ) and all
incentive stock options previously granted under the Plan and any Other Plans which are exercisable for the first time during a
calendar year ( Prior Grants ) would exceed the $100,000 Limit, be exercisable as follows:   

(A)          the
portion of the Current Grant which would, when added to any Prior Grants, be exercisable with respect to Shares which would have
an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the respective Grant Date for such options) in excess of the $100,000 Limit shall,
notwithstanding the terms of the Current Grant, be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee in the first subsequent calendar
year or years in which it could be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee when added to all Prior Grants without exceeding
the $100,000 Limit; and 

(B)
          if, viewed as of the date of the Current Grant, any portion of a Current Grant could not be exercised under the preceding
provisions of this Subsection (iv) during any calendar year commencing with the calendar year in which it is first
exercisable through and including the last calendar year in which it may by its terms be exercised, such portion of the
Current Grant shall not be an incentive stock option, but shall be exercisable as a separate Option at such date or dates as
are provided in the Current Grant; 

(v)  shall be granted within 10 years from the earlier of the date the Plan is adopted or the date the
Plan is approved by the shareholders of the Company;   

(vi)  shall require the Grantee to notify the Board of any disposition of any Shares issued pursuant
to the exercise of the incentive stock option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain
disqualifying dispositions), within 10 days of such disposition; and   

(vii)  shall by its terms not be assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of descent
and distribution and may be exercised, during the Grantee's lifetime, only by the Grantee; provided, however, that the Grantee
may, to the extent provided in the Plan in any manner specified by the Board, designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise such
incentive stock option after the Grantee's death.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board
may, without the consent of the Grantee, at any time before the exercise of an option (whether or not an incentive stock option),
take any action necessary to prevent such option from being treated as an incentive stock option. 

6.5.   Exercise of Options . Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise
to the Company or its designee, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied
by full payment for the Shares as instructed by the Board or, subject to the approval of the Board pursuant to procedures approved
by the Board,   

(a)  through the sale of the Shares acquired on exercise of the Option through a broker-dealer to whom
the Grantee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Company the
amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay for such Shares, together with, if requested by the Company, the amount of federal,
state, local or foreign withholding taxes payable by Grantee by reason of such exercise,   

(b)  through simultaneous sale through a broker of Shares acquired on exercise, as permitted under Regulation
T of the Federal Reserve Board,   

(c)  by transfer to the Company of the number of Shares then owned by the Grantee, the Fair Market Value
of which equals the purchase price of the Shares purchased in connection with the Option exercise, properly endorsed for transfer
to the Company; provided however, that Shares used for this purpose must have been held by the Grantee for such minimum period
of time as may be established from time to time by the Board; and provided further that the Fair Market Value of any Shares delivered
in payment of the purchase price upon exercise of the Options shall be the Fair Market Value as of the exercise date, which shall
be the date of delivery of the certificates for the Stock used as payment of the exercise price. For purposes of this Section 6.5(c),
in lieu of actually transferring to the Company the number of Shares then owned by the Grantee, the Board may, in its discretion
permit the Grantee to submit to the Company a statement affirming ownership by the Grantee of such number of Shares and request
that such Shares, although not actually transferred, be deemed to have been transferred by the Grantee as payment of the exercise
price, or   

(d)  by a  net exercise  arrangement pursuant to which the Company will not require a payment
of the Option Price but will reduce the number of Shares upon the exercise by the largest number of whole shares that has a Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise that does not exceed the aggregate Option Price. With respect to any remaining balance of
the aggregate option price, the Company will accept a cash payment from the Grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  net
exercise  arrangement will not be an eligible exercise method for incentive stock options unless and until the Company and
its advisors conclude that such method of exercise may be utilized without resulting in a disqualification of the incentive stock
option.

Award Agreement which shall be entered into by the Company and the Grantee to whom the SAR is granted and which shall specify the

discretion shall determine.   

7.3.   Exercise of SARs . SARs shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise
to the Company or its designee, setting forth the number of Shares over which the SAR is to be exercised. Tandem SARs (a) may be
exercised with respect to all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the
equivalent portion of the related Option; (b) may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is
then exercisable; and (c) may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option exceeds the Option
Price of the Option. The value of the payment with respect to the Tandem SAR may be no more than 100% of the difference between
the Option Price of the underlying Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Option at the time
the Tandem SAR is exercised.   

7.4.   Expiration of SARs . A SAR granted under the Plan shall expire on the date set forth in the
SAR Award Agreement, which date shall be determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Unless otherwise specifically provided

extent that the related Option is exercisable. The Tandem SAR shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination
or exercise of the related Options, except that Tandem SARs granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered
by a related Option shall not be reduced until the exercise or termination of the related Option exceeds the number of Shares not
covered by the SARs.   

7.5.   Payment of SAR Amount . Upon exercise of a SAR, a Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment
from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the positive difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on
the date of exercise over the exercise price per Share by (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
The payment upon a SAR exercise shall be solely in whole Shares of equivalent value. Fractional Shares shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole Share with no cash consideration being paid upon exercise.

event no later than 10 business days after the Grant Date for such shares.   

8.5.   Effect of Forfeiture . If Restricted Shares are forfeited, and if the Grantee was required
to pay for such shares or acquired such Restricted Shares upon the exercise of an Option, the Grantee shall resell such Restricted
Shares to the Company at a price equal to the lesser of (x) the amount paid by the Grantee for such Restricted Shares, or (y) the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of such forfeiture. The Company shall pay to the Grantee the required amount as soon as

determines.   

10.2.   Value/Performance Goals . Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established

Business Criteria which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units
or Performance Shares that will be paid to the Grantee. For purposes of this Article 10, the time period during which the performance
goals must be met shall be called a  Performance Period.  The Board shall have complete discretion to establish the performance
goals.   

10.3.   Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares . Subject to the terms of the Plan, after
the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be entitled to receive
a payment based on the number and value of Performance Units or Performance Shares earned by the Grantee over the Performance Period,
determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.   

If a Grantee is promoted,
demoted or transferred to a different business unit of the Company during a Performance Period, then, to the extent the Board determines
appropriate, the Board may adjust, change or eliminate the performance goals or the applicable Performance Period as it deems appropriate
in order to make them appropriate and comparable to the initial performance goals or Performance Period. 

10.4.   Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares . Payment of earned
Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be made in a lump sum following the close of the applicable Performance Period. The

applicable Performance Period. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Board. The form
of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.

Board, a Grantee may be entitled to receive any dividends declared with respect to Shares which have been earned in connection

by the Board, be entitled to exercise his or her voting rights with respect to such Shares.

the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom
any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of the Grantee's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each
such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Grantee, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will
be effective only when filed by the Grantee in writing with the Company during the Grantee's lifetime. In the absence of any such
designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Grantee's death shall be paid to the Grantee's estate.

Directors of the Company may at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part
without the approval of the Company's shareholders, except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company determines it is
desirable to obtain approval of the Company's shareholders, to retain eligibility for exemption from the limitations of Code Section
162(m), to have available the ability for Options to qualify as ISOs, to comply with the requirements for listing on any exchange
where the Company's Shares are listed, or for any other purpose the Board of Directors of the Company deems appropriate.   

13.2.   Adjustments Upon Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events . The Board may make adjustments
in the terms and conditions of Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including the events described in Section
4.2) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting
principles, whenever the Board determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of
the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.   

13.3.   Awards Previously Granted . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary
(but subject to Section 2.8 and Section 13.2), no termination, amendment or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in
any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Grantee of such Award. Any adjustment,
modification, extension or renewal of an Option shall be effected such that the Option is either exempt from, or is compliant with,
Code section 409A.   

13.4.   Adjustments in Connection with Change of Control . In the event the Company undergoes a Change
of Control or in the event of a separation, spin-off, sale of a material portion of the Company's assets or any  going private 
transaction under Rule 13e-3 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act and in which a Change of Control does not occur, the Board,
or the board of directors of any corporation assuming the obligations of the Company, shall have the full power and discretion
to prescribe and amend the terms and conditions for the exercise, or modification, of any outstanding Awards granted hereunder
in the manner as agreed to by the Board as set forth in the definitive agreement relating to the transaction. Without limitation,
the Board or Plan Committee may:   

(a)  remove restrictions on Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units;   

(b)  modify the performance requirements for any other Awards;

(a)  Whenever under the Plan, Shares are to be delivered upon exercise or payment of an Award, or upon
the lapse of Restrictions on an Award, or any other event with respect to rights and benefits hereunder (the exercise date, date
such Restrictions lapse or such payment of any other benefit or right occurs hereinafter referred to as the   Tax Date  ),
the Company shall be entitled to require and may accommodate the Grantee's request if so requested, to satisfy all federal, state,
local and foreign tax withholding requirements, including Social Security and Medicare (  FICA  ) taxes related
thereto (  Tax Withholding  ), by one or a combination of the following methods:   

(i)          Payment
of an amount in cash equal to the amount to be withheld; 

(ii)          Requesting
the Company to withhold from those Shares that would otherwise be received upon exercise of the Option or the SAR payable in Shares,
upon the lapse of Restrictions on an Award, a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the Tax Date equal to the amount to
be withheld; or 

(iii)          withholding
from compensation otherwise due to the Grantee. 

The Board in
its sole discretion may provide that the maximum amount of tax withholding to be satisfied by withholding Shares pursuant to clause
(ii) above shall not exceed the minimum amount of taxes, including FICA taxes, required to be withheld under federal, state and
local law. An election by Grantee under this subsection is irrevocable. Any fractional share amount and any additional withholding
not paid by the withholding or surrender of Shares must be paid in cash. If no timely election is made, the Grantee must deliver
cash to satisfy all tax withholding requirements. 

(b)  Any Grantee who makes a disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option granted under the
Plan or who makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code shall remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy all resulting
Tax Withholding;  provided  that, in lieu of or in addition to the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to withhold
such Tax Withholding from compensation otherwise due to the Grantee or from any Shares or other payment due to the Grantee under
the Plan.   

14.2.   Notification under Code Section 83(b) . If the Grantee, in connection with the exercise of
any Option, or the grant of Restricted Shares, makes the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code to include in such
Grantee's gross income in the year of transfer the amounts specified in Section 83(b) of the Code, then such Grantee shall notify
the Company of such election within 10 days of filing the notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service, in addition
to any filing and notification required pursuant to regulations issued under Section 83(b) of the Code. The Board may, in connection
with the grant of an Award or at any time thereafter prior to such an election being made, prohibit a Grantee from making the election
described above.   

Article
15. Equity Incentive Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries 

The Board may authorize
any foreign Subsidiary to adopt a plan for granting Awards ( Foreign Equity Incentive Plan ). All awards granted under
such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall be treated as grants under the Plan. Such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall have such
terms and provisions as the Board permits not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan and which may be more restrictive than
those contained in the Plan. Awards granted under such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall be governed by the terms of the Plan
except to the extent that the provisions of the Foreign Equity Incentive Plans are more restrictive than the terms of the Plan,
in which case such terms of the Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall control. 

Article
16. Additional Provisions 

16.1.   Successors . All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted
hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or
indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company.   

16.2.   Gender and Number . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used
herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.   

16.3.   Severability . If any part of the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority
to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any other part of the Plan. Any Section or part
of a Section so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms
of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.   

16.4.   Requirements of Law . The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall
be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or stock exchanges
as may be required. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award, Grantees shall not be entitled to exercise, or receive
benefits under, any Award, and the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares or other benefits to a Grantee, if such
exercise or delivery would constitute a violation by the Grantee or the Company of any applicable law or regulation.   

(a)  If the Board deems it necessary to comply with any applicable securities law, or the requirements
of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed, the Board may impose any restriction on Shares acquired pursuant to Awards
under the Plan as it may deem advisable. All Shares transferred under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall
be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and
other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which Shares are then listed, any applicable securities law,. If so requested
by the Company, the Grantee shall represent to the Company in writing that he or she will not sell or offer to sell any Shares
unless a registration statement shall be in effect with respect to such Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 or unless he or
she shall have furnished to the Company evidence satisfactory to the Company that such registration is not required.   

(b)  If the Board determines that the exercise of, or delivery of benefits pursuant to, any Award would
violate any applicable provision of securities laws or the listing requirements of any stock exchange upon which any of the Company's
equity securities are then listed, then the Board may postpone any such exercise or delivery, as applicable, but the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause such exercise or delivery to comply with all such provisions at the earliest practicable date.   

16.6.   No Rights as a Shareholder . A Grantee shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect
to the Shares (other than Restricted Shares) which may be deliverable upon exercise or payment of such Award until such shares
have been delivered to him or her. Restricted Shares, whether held by a Grantee or in escrow by the escrow agent, shall confer
on the Grantee all rights of a shareholder of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or Award Agreement. Unless
otherwise determined by the Board at the time of a grant of Restricted Shares, any cash dividends that become payable on Restricted
Shares shall be deferred and, if the Board so determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Shares. Except as otherwise provided
in an Award Agreement, any share dividends and deferred cash dividends issued with respect to Restricted Shares shall be subject
to the same restrictions and other terms as apply to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such dividends are issued. The
Board may provide for payment of interest on deferred cash dividends.   

16.7.   Nature of Payments . Awards shall be special incentive payments to the Grantee and shall
not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Grantee for purposes of determining any pension,
retirement, death or other benefit under (a) any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, insurance or other employee benefit
plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or (b) any agreement between (i) the Company or any Subsidiary and (ii) the Grantee, except
as such plan or agreement shall otherwise expressly provide.   

16.8.   Military Service . Awards shall be administered in accordance with Section 414(u) of the
Code and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.   

16.9.   Data Protection . The Board, the Plan Committee and any other person or entity empowered
by the Board or the Plan Committee to administer the Plan may process, store, transfer or disclose personal data of the Grantees
to the extent required for the implementation and administration of the Plan. The Board, the Plan Committee and any other person
or entity empowered by the Board or the Plan Committee to administer the Plan shall comply with any applicable data protection
laws.   

16.10.   Governing Law . The Plan and the rights of any Grantee receiving an Award thereunder shall
be construed and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Kansas without giving effect to the principles
of the conflict of laws to the contrary.

to elect to receive, an Option in lieu of or in substitution for any other compensation (whether payable currently or on a deferred
basis, and whether payable under the Plan or otherwise) which such Eligible Director may be eligible to receive from the Company,

(  Acquisition  ), however effected, by the Company of another corporation or entity (  Acquired Entity  )
or the assets thereof, (y) associated with an option to purchase shares of stock or other equity interest of the Acquired Entity

the Grantee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Company the
amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay for such Shares, together with, if requested by the Company, the amount of federal,
state, local or foreign withholding taxes payable by Grantee by reason of such exercise,   

(b)  through simultaneous sale through a broker of Shares acquired on exercise, as permitted under Regulation
T of the Federal Reserve Board,

to the Company;  provided however , that Shares used for this purpose must have been held by the Grantee for such minimum
period of time as may be established from time to time by the Board; and provided further that the Fair Market Value of any Shares

its discretion permit the Grantee to submit to the Company a statement affirming ownership by the Grantee of such number of Shares
and request that such Shares, although not actually transferred, be deemed to have been transferred by the Grantee as payment of
the exercise price, or   

(d)  by a  net exercise  arrangement pursuant to which the Company will not require a payment
of the Option Price but will reduce the number of Shares upon the exercise by the largest number of whole shares that has a Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise that does not exceed the aggregate Option Price. With respect to any remaining balance of
the aggregate option price, the Company will accept a cash payment from the Grantee.

or exercise of the related Options, except that Tandem SARs granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered
by a related Option shall not be reduced until the exercise or termination of the related Option exceeds the number of Shares not
covered by the SARs.   

7.5.   Payment of SAR Amount . Upon exercise of a SAR, a Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment
from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the positive difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on

the nearest whole Share with no cash consideration being paid upon exercise.

disability, retirement or Mandatory Retirement, or Termination of Affiliation by the Company other than for Cause.   

9.3.   Crediting Restricted Stock Units . The Company shall establish an account (  RSU Account  )

to the Grantee's RSU Account as of the Grant Date of such Restricted Stock Units. RSU Accounts shall be maintained for recordkeeping
purposes only and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate or set aside assets representing securities or other amounts
credited to RSU Accounts. The obligation to make distributions of securities or other amounts credited to RSU Accounts shall be
an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the Company.

Article
10. Performance Units and Performance Shares 

10.1.   Grant of Performance Units and Performance Shares . Subject to the terms of the Plan, Performance
Units or Performance Shares may be granted to any Eligible Director in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from
time to time, as the Board shall determine. Each grant of Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be evidenced by an Award
Agreement which shall specify the terms and conditions applicable to the Performance Units or Performance Shares, as the Board
determines.   

10.2.   Value/Performance Goals . Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established
by the Board at the time of grant, that is equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. The Board shall set the
Business Criteria which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units
or Performance Shares that will be paid to the Grantee. For purposes of this Article 10, the time period during which the performance
goals must be met shall be called a  Performance Period.  The Board shall have complete discretion to establish the performance
goals.   

10.3.   Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares . Subject to the terms of the Plan, after
the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be entitled to receive
a payment based on the number and value of Performance Units or Performance Shares earned by the Grantee over the Performance Period,
determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.   

10.4.   Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units and Performance Shares . Payment of earned
Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be made in a lump sum following the close of the applicable Performance Period. The
Board may cause earned Performance Units or Performance Shares to be paid in cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) which
have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units or Performance Shares at the close of the
applicable Performance Period. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Board. The form
of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.   

As determined by the
Board, a Grantee may be entitled to receive any dividends declared with respect to Shares which have been earned in connection
with grants of Performance Units or Performance Shares but not yet distributed to the Grantee. In addition, a Grantee may, as determined
by the Board, be entitled to exercise his or her voting rights with respect to such Shares. 

Article
11. Beneficiary Designation 

Each Grantee under
the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom
any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of the Grantee's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each
such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Grantee, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will
be effective only when filed by the Grantee in writing with the Company during the Grantee's lifetime. In the absence of any such
designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Grantee's death shall be paid to the Grantee's estate. 

Article
12. Amendment, Modification, and Termination 

12.1.   Amendment, Modification, and Termination . Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Board may
at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part without the approval of the
Company's shareholders, except to the extent the Board determines it is desirable to obtain approval of the Company's shareholders,
to comply with the requirements for listing on any exchange where the Company's Shares are listed, or for any other purpose the
Board deems appropriate.   

12.2.   Adjustments Upon Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events . The Board may make adjustments
in the terms and conditions of Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including the events described in Section
4.2) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting
principles, whenever the Board determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of
the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.   

12.3.   Awards Previously Granted . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary
(but subject to Section 2.8 (amendments in connection with a Change of Control) and Section 12.2), no termination, amendment or
modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written
consent of the Grantee of such Award. Any adjustment, modification, extension or renewal of an Award shall be effected such that
the Award, at all times, is either exempt from, or is compliant with, Code section 409A.   

12.4.   Adjustments in Connection with Change of Control . In the event the Company undergoes a Change
of Control or in the event of a separation, spin-off, sale of a material portion of the Company's assets or any  going private 
transaction under Rule 13e-3 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act and in which a Change of Control does not occur, the Board,
or the board of directors of any corporation assuming the obligations of the Company, shall have the full power and discretion
to prescribe and amend the terms and conditions for the exercise, or modification, of any outstanding Awards granted hereunder
in the manner as agreed to by the Board as set forth in the definitive agreement relating to the transaction. Without limitation,
the Board may:   

(a)  remove restrictions on Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units;   

(b)  modify the performance requirements for any other Awards;   

(c)  provide that Options or other Awards granted hereunder must be exercised in connection with the
closing of such transactions, and that if not so exercised such Awards will expire;   

(d)  provide for the purchase by the Company of any such Award, upon the Grantee's request, for an amount
of cash equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Grantee's rights
had such Award been currently exercisable or payable;   

(e)  make such adjustment to any such Award then outstanding as the Board deems appropriate to reflect
such Change of Control;   

(f)  cause any such Award then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the
acquiring or surviving corporation after such Change of Control. Any such determinations by the Board may be made generally with
respect to all Grantees, or may be made on a case-by-case basis with respect to particular Grantees.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any transaction undertaken for the purpose of reincorporating the Company under the laws of another jurisdiction, if such transaction
does not materially affect the beneficial ownership of the Company's Shares, such transaction shall not constitute a merger, consolidation,
major acquisition of property for stock, separation, reorganization, liquidation, or Change of Control. 

12.5.   Prohibition on Repricings . Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the
Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,
merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended
to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or SARs or cancel outstanding Options or SARs in exchange for cash, other Awards
or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs without stockholder
approval.   

Article
13. Withholding Tax 

To the extent applicable
under applicable tax laws, whenever under the Plan, Shares are to be delivered upon exercise or payment of an Award, or upon the
lapse of Restrictions on an Award, or any other event with respect to rights and benefits hereunder (the exercise date, date such
Restrictions lapse or such payment of any other benefit or right occurs hereinafter referred to as the  Tax Date ), the
Company shall be entitled to require and may accommodate the Eligible Director 's request if so requested, to satisfy all Federal
and Cantonal withholding taxes, including Social Security taxes related thereto ( Tax Withholding ), by one or a combination
of the following methods: 

(i)  Payment of an amount in cash equal to the amount to be withheld;   

(ii)  Requesting the Company to withhold from those Shares that would otherwise be received upon exercise
of the Option or the SAR payable in Shares, upon the lapse of Restrictions on an Award, a number of Shares having a Fair Market
Value on the Tax Date equal to the amount to be withheld; or   

(iii)  Withholding from compensation otherwise due to the Eligible Director.   

Any fractional share
amount and any additional withholding not paid by the withholding or surrender of Shares must be paid in cash. If no timely election
is made, the Grantee must deliver cash to satisfy all tax withholding requirements. 

Article
14. Additional Provisions 

14.1.   Successors . All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted
hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or
indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company.   

14.2.   Gender and Number . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used
herein also shall include the feminine and vice-versa; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the
plural.   

14.3.   Severability . If any part of the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority
to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any other part of the Plan. Any Section or part
of a Section so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms
of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.   

14.4.   Requirements of Law . The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall
be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or stock exchanges
as may be required. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award, Grantees shall not be entitled to exercise, or receive
benefits under, any Award, and the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares or other benefits to a Grantee, if such
exercise or delivery would constitute a violation by the Grantee or the Company of any applicable law or regulation.   

(a)  If the Board deems it necessary to comply with any applicable securities law, or the requirements
of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed, the Board may impose any restriction on Shares acquired pursuant to Awards
under the Plan as it may deem advisable. All Shares transferred under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall
be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and
other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which Shares are then listed, and any applicable securities law. If so requested
by the Company, the Grantee shall represent to the Company in writing that he or she will not sell or offer to sell any Shares
unless a registration statement shall be in effect with respect to such Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 or unless he or
she shall have furnished to the Company evidence satisfactory to the Company that such registration is not required.   

(b)  If the Board determines that the exercise of, or delivery of benefits pursuant to, any Award would
violate any applicable provision of securities laws or the listing requirements of any stock exchange upon which any of the Company's
equity securities are then listed, then the Board may postpone any such exercise or delivery, as applicable, but the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause such exercise or delivery to comply with all such provisions at the earliest practicable date.   

14.6.   No Rights as a Shareholder . A Grantee shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect
to the Shares (other than Restricted Shares) which may be deliverable upon exercise or payment of such Award until such shares
have been delivered to him or her. Restricted Shares, whether held by a Grantee or in escrow by the escrow agent, shall confer
on the Grantee all rights of a shareholder of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or Award Agreement. Unless
otherwise determined by the Board at the time of a grant of Restricted Shares, any cash dividends that become payable on Restricted
Shares shall be deferred and, if the Board so determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Shares. Except as otherwise provided
in an Award Agreement, any share dividends and deferred cash dividends issued with respect to Restricted Shares shall be subject
to the same restrictions and other terms as apply to the Restricted Shares with respect to which such dividends are issued. The
Board may provide for payment of interest on deferred cash dividends.   

(a)  All Awards granted under the Plan are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury regulations and guidance issued thereunder ( Section 409A ) and that the Plan be interpreted and operated consistent
with such requirements of Section 409A in order to avoid the application of additive income taxes under Section 409A ( 409A
Penalties ). To the extent that an Award is subject to Section 409A, except as the Grantee and Company may otherwise determine
in writing, all Awards shall be created in a manner that will meet the requirements of Section 409A, such that the Grantees of
such Awards are not subject to the 409A Penalties.   

(b)  To extent that a Grantee would otherwise be entitled to any payment under the Plan that (i) constitutes
 deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A, (ii) is payable on account of the Grantee's  separation from service 
(within the meaning of Section 409A), and (iii) that if paid during the six months beginning on the date of the Grantee's termination
of employment would be subject the 409A Penalties because the Grantee is a  specified employee  of the Company (within
the meaning of Section 409A and as determined from time to time by the Plan Committee), the payment will be paid to the Grantee
on the earliest of the six-month anniversary of the termination of employment, a change in ownership or effective control of the
Company (within the meaning of Section 409A) or the Grantee's death.   

(c)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall not be amended in any
manner that would cause (i) the Plan or any amounts or benefits payable hereunder to fail to comply with the requirements of Section
409A, to the extent applicable, or (ii) any amounts or benefits payable hereunder that are not subject to Section 409A to become
subject thereto (unless they also are in compliance therewith), and the provisions of any purported amendment that may reasonably
be expected to result in such non-compliance shall be of no force or effect with respect to the Plan.   

(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Board, to the extent it deems necessary or
advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan or any
Award granted thereunder to reflect the intention that the Plan (and any Award) qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section
409A in a manner that as closely as practicable achieves the original intent of the Plan and with the least reduction, if any,
in overall benefit to the Grantee to comply with Section 409A on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance
with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A; provided, however, that neither the Company, the Board, nor any
of their officers or individual directors make any representation that the Plan or any Award shall be exempt from or comply with
Section 409A and make no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Plan or any Award.   

14.8.   Nature of Payments . Awards shall be special incentive payments to the Grantee and shall
not be taken into account for any other Company compensatory plan, arrangement or contract relating to the Grantee except as such
plan, arrangement or agreement shall otherwise expressly provide.   

14.9.   Military Service . Awards shall be administered in accordance with Section 414(u) of the
Code and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.   

14.10.   Data Protection . The Board and any other person or entity empowered by the Board to administer
the Plan may process, store, transfer or disclose personal data of the Grantees to the extent required for the implementation and
administration of the Plan. The Board and any other person or entity empowered by the Board to administer the Plan shall comply
with any applicable data protection laws.   

14.11.   Governing Law . The Plan and the rights of any Grantee receiving an Award thereunder shall
be construed and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Kansas without giving effect to the principles
of the conflict of laws to the contrary.   

Annex to the Plan for Swiss based Grantees
and Grantees subject to Swiss inheritance law 

1.  Article 11. shall be replaced with the following: 

Each Grantee under the Plan may, from time
to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan
is to be paid in case of the Grantee's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall
revoke all prior designations by the same Grantee, shall be in a form and procedure prescribed by the applicable Swiss inheritance
law. Irrespective of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Grantee's death shall be paid to the Grantee's estate.

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section
1.            Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section
2.            Grant of RSUs   

As of the Date of Grant
identified above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity
to receive that number of unrestricted Shares identified below the heading  Number of RSUs Granted  on the Notice of
Grant (the  RSUs ). Provided you are a member of the Company s Board of Directors (and at all times since the Date
of Grant have been a member of the Company s Board of Directors) and unless your right to receive the RSUs has been forfeited
pursuant to Section 3 below, then (subject to Section 11 below) you will be paid a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate
number of your remaining RSUs on the dates above identified below the heading  Dates Payable  on the Notice of Grant.
If a date under  Dates Payable  is a Saturday or Sunday or any other non-business day, then you will be paid the Shares
payable on that date on the next business day. 

Section
3.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation    

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation for any reason, the effect of such Termination of Affiliation on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death, Disability,
retirement on or after attaining Mandatory Retirement Age, a  Retirement  as defined below, or your removal by the
Company other than for Cause (including without limitation the Company s decision not to slate you for reelection), your
RSUs that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation, if any, shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and
the Company shall, promptly settle all RSUs by delivery to you (or, after your death, to your personal representative or designated
beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining RSUs. A  Retirement  for
purposes of this Award Agreement means the Grantee s ceasing to be a member of the Company s Board of Directors other
than for Cause after 5 years of service on the Board    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than under the circumstances described immediately above in Section 3(a) (including without limitation your failure to be
reelected to the Company s Board of Directors, your voluntary resignation or your failure to run for reelection to the Company s
Board of Directors), your RSUs, to the extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation, shall thereupon automatically
be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.     

Section
4.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of RSUs shall be acquired for his/her own account for
investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but in no
event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
5.            Nontransferability of RSUs   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including,
unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal
separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her
lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
6.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (a) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the

therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

Section
9.            Amendments    

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award

amount and any additional withholding not paid by the withholding or surrender of Shares must be paid in cash. If no timely election

Section
13.         Severability

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section
1.            Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section
2.            Grant of RSUs   

As of the Date of Grant
identified above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity
to receive that number of unrestricted Shares identified below the heading  Number of RSUs Granted  on the Notice of
Grant (the  RSUs ). Provided you are employed (and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company
on a Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week)
and unless your right to receive the RSUs has been forfeited pursuant to Section 3 below, then (subject to Section 12 below) you
will be paid a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining RSUs on the dates above identified
below the heading  Dates Payable  on the Notice of Grant. If a date under  Dates Payable  is a Saturday or
Sunday or any other non-business day, then you will be paid the Shares payable on that date on the next business day. For purposes
of this Agreement, except where the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking a Company-approved leave
of absence, was employed on a Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during the period of such Company-approved
leave. 

Section
3.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation
or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without
Cause, voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death, or Disability, the effect of such
Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation on account of death or Disability, your RSUs that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation,
if any, shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all RSUs by delivery to you (or, after your
death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining RSUs;  

(b)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation during the period ( Change of Control Period ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first
anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than
for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then your RSUs that were forfeitable shall thereupon become nonforfeitable
and the Company shall immediately settle all RSUs by delivery to you a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining RSUs;  

(c)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason other than for, death or Disability, or under the circumstances described in immediately
above in Section 3(b), your RSUs, to the extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation and to the extent
permitted by the applicable Swiss law, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this
Award Agreement;  

(d)   If you cease to be employed
on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other than for death or Disability, your RSUs, to the extent forfeitable immediately before
such cessation of employment on a Full-Time Basis and to the extent permitted by applicable Swiss law, shall thereupon automatically
be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.  

Section
4.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of RSUs shall be acquired for his/her own account for
investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but in no
event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
5.            Nontransferability of RSUs   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including,
unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal
separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her
lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
6.            Restrictive Covenants   

As a condition of this
Award Agreement, the Grantee's right to the RSUs, and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into
with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Nondisclosure of Award
Agreement Terms .  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose
any information concerning this Award Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee's legal and financial advisors
who agree to be bound by this Paragraph 6(a).  

(b)     Noncompetition.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant,
independent contractor or advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest
in any company, entity or person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other
location outside the United States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee's
knowledge) plans to conduct business. Nothing in this Section 6(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment
in and owning up to one-percent (1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange
or actively traded in an over-the-counter market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability
to control or influence the policy decisions of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.  

(c)     Noninterference.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
solicit, entice away, or otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier
or other similar business relation or (to the Grantee's knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(d)     Nonsolicitation.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
hire, recruit, employ, or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(e)     Confidentiality.  
The Grantee acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all
valuable and unique information and techniques acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their
businesses, operations, employees and customers ( Confidential Information ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential
Information is the sole and exclusive property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information
would cause damage to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to
disclose any Confidential Information or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result
or as a consequence of or through the Grantee's performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly
or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates in any manner to the Company's business. This obligation will continue
even though the Grantee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 6(e) shall apply in
addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee
and the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.
  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments
or information about the Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
about prospects for the future of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(g)     Remedy.   The
Grantee acknowledges the consideration provided herein (absent the Grantee's agreement to this Section 6) is more than the Company
is obligated to pay, and the Grantee further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and
monetary damages would not provide adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee
breaches any of the Grantee's obligations under this Section 6, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive
relief therefor, and in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall
be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition,
this Award Agreement and all of Grantee's right hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages
in such activity and the Board shall be entitled on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require
the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by the Grantee's upon vesting of any RSUs to the Company and to require the Grantee
to repay any proceeds received at any time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any RSUs
(plus interest on such amount from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time
in  The Wall Street Journal ) and to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award
Agreement and recovering such Shares and proceeds.  

Section
7.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the
RSUs and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights with respect to any of the RSUs, in both cases (i) and
(ii) above, unless and until the actual Shares underlying the RSUs have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section
8.            No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section
9.            Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

Section
10.           Amendments    

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee's rights under this Award Agreement
without the Grantee's consent. 

Section
11.           Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 9 or 10 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section
12.           Withholding   

At the time the RSUs
are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding and social taxes on your
behalf. Accordingly, the Company shall have the power to withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient
to satisfy any such federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax or social tax requirements. At the Company's discretion, withholding
may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of RSUs deliverable to you. If the
Company elects to reduce the number of RSUs deliverable to you and less than the full value of an RSU is needed to satisfy any
applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional share in cash in an amount
equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional RSU. 

Section
13.           Notice   

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing by (a) personal delivery, or (b) expedited, recognized
delivery service with proof of delivery, or (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested,
or (d) telecopy or email (provided that the telecopy or email is confirmed). Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder
shall be deemed to be delivered on the date which it was personally delivered, sent to the intended addressee, or, whether actually
received or not, on the third business day after it is deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid,
addressed to the person who is to receive it at the address which such person has theretofore specified by written notice delivered
in accordance herewith. The Company or the Grantee may change, at any time and from time to time, by written notice to the other,
the address specified for receiving notices. Until changed in accordance herewith, the Company's address for receiving notices
shall be Garmin Ltd., Attention: General Counsel, M hlentalstrasse 2, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Unless changed, the
Grantee's address for receiving notices shall be the last known address of the Grantee on the Company's records. It shall be the
Grantee's sole responsibility to notify the Company as to any change in his or her address. Such notification shall be made in
accordance with this Section 13. 

Section
14.           Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 6 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section
15.           Binding Effect   

This Award Agreement
shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

Section
16.           Governing Law and Jurisdiction   

This Award Agreement
and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of
Kansas without giving effect to the principles of the Conflict of Laws to the contrary. Except as otherwise provided by mandatory
forum requirements of the applicable law, the courts of the State of Kansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction with regard to any
disputes under the Plan.  The Company shall retain, however, in addition
the right to bring any claim in any other appropriate forum.

Cause (as defined below in this Section 3) voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death,
or Disability, the effect of such Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion
of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability,
your RSUs that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation, if any, shall thereupon become nonforfeitable
and the Company shall, promptly settle all RSUs by delivery to you (or, after your death, to your personal representative or designated
beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining RSUs;    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation during the period ( Change
of Control Period ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first anniversary of the Change of Control, which
Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good
Reason, then your RSUs that were forfeitable shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall immediately settle all
RSUs by delivery to you a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining RSUs;    

(c)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than for, death or Disability, or under the circumstances described in immediately above in Section 3(b), your RSUs, to the
extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall
have no further rights under this Award Agreement;     

(d)   If you cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other
than for death or Disability, your RSUs, to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on a Full-Time
Basis, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement;    

(e)   Notwithstanding the definition of  Cause  set forth in
the Plan, for purposes of this Award Agreement, the term  Cause  means, without in any way limiting its definition
under common law (which is expressly included in this definition), any improper conduct by you which is materially detrimental
to the Company or any Subsidiary including, but not limited to:    

1.   Your conviction of, or a plea of guilty to, any indictable offence
or other crime that involves fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude;    

2.   Any willful action or omission by you which would constitute grounds
for immediate dismissal under the employment policies of the Company or the Subsidiary by which you are employed, including but
not limited to intoxication with alcohol or illegal drugs while on the premises on the Company or any Subsidiary, or any violation
of applicable sexual harassment laws or the internal sexual harassment policy of the Company or the Subsidiary by which you are
employed;    

3.   Your habitual neglect of duties, including but not limited to, repeated
unauthorized absences from work without reasonable excuse; or    

4.   Your willful or intentional material misconduct in the performance
of your duties that results in financial detriment to the Company or any Subsidiary.    

Section
4.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of RSUs shall be acquired for his/her own account for
investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. If the Board so determines,
any share certificates issued pursuant to this Award Agreement shall bear a legend to the effect that the Shares have been so acquired.
The Company may, but in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities
laws or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration,
qualification, or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions
on the transfer of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel,
satisfactory to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities
laws or (b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the common
shares of the Company are then listed. 

The Grantee also acknowledges
and agrees that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of RSUs will not be able to be transferred
or resold in Canada pursuant to the securities legislation of the Provinces and Territories of Canada except in accordance with
limited exemptions under applicable securities legislation and regulatory policy and compliance with the other requirements of
applicable law. 

Section
5.            Nontransferability of RSUs   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including,
unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal
separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her
lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
6.            Restrictive Covenants   

As a condition of this
Award Agreement, the Grantee s right to the RSUs, and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into
with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Nondisclosure of Award Agreement Terms .  The Grantee
agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose any information concerning this Award
Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee s legal and financial advisors who agree to be bound by this Paragraph
6(a).    

(b)     Noncompetition.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in (whether as a shareholder, partner, member, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant, or in any other capacity) any company or organization with activities, products or services
involving:    

1.   Personal and team activity monitoring systems, including speed, distance
and cadence monitoring systems, motion analysis systems and associated watch displays and other displays and heart rate monitoring
systems and associated watch displays and other displays and prosthetics monitoring and control systems; or    

2.   Wireless communications systems and protocols designed for low power
applications;    

in any province,
state or country in which the Company or any Subsidiary conducts business (or, to the knowledge of the Grantee any additional location
in which the Company or any Subsidiary intends to conduct business). 

Nothing in this
Section 6(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment in and owning up to one-percent (1%) of the common
stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded in an over-the-counter market;
provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability to control or influence the policy decisions of any
direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary. 

(c)     Noninterference.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, solicit, entice away, or
otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier or other similar business
relation or (to the Grantee s knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(d)     Nonsolicitation.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, hire, recruit, employ,
or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary.    

(e)     Confidentiality.   The Grantee acknowledges that it is
the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all valuable and unique information and techniques
acquired, developed or used by the Company and its subsidiaries relating to their businesses, operations, employees and customers
( Confidential Information ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive property
of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to disclose any Confidential Information or proprietary
information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee s performance
of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates in any
manner to the Company s business. This obligation will continue even though the Grantee s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary
may have terminated. This paragraph 6(e) shall apply in addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality agreements
that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee and the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.   The Grantee agrees not
to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments or information about the
Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or about prospects for the future
of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(g)     Remedy.   The Grantee acknowledges the consideration
provided herein (absent the Grantee s agreement to this Section 6) is more than the Company is obligated to pay, and the Grantee
further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and monetary damages would not provide
adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee breaches any of the Grantee s obligations
under this Section 6, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive relief therefor, and in particular, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies
they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition, this Award Agreement and all of Grantee s right
hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity and the Board shall be entitled
on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by
the Grantee s upon vesting of any RSUs to the Company and to require the Grantee to repay any proceeds received at any time from
the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any RSUs (plus interest on such amount from the date received
at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal ) and to recover all
reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award Agreement and recovering such Shares and proceeds.    

Section
7.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates
for Shares pursuant to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall
have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive
any dividends or dividend equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions
made with respect to the RSUs and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights with respect to any of the RSUs,
in both cases (i) and (ii) above, unless and until the actual Shares underlying the RSUs have been delivered pursuant to this Award
Agreement. 

Section
8.            No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section
9.            Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

Section
10.         Amendments    

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee s rights under this Award Agreement
without the Grantee s consent. 

Section
11.         Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 9 or 10 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section
12.         Withholding   

Notwithstanding Article 14
of the Plan, this Section 12 will apply to the Company s withholding obligations related to this Award Agreement. At the time the
RSUs are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding taxes on your behalf.
Accordingly, and at the Company s discretion, such Federal, Provincial, local or foreign withholding tax requirements may be satisfied
by you providing specific written authorization to deduct, from any earnings owed or accruing to you, the appropriate sum of money
required for such withholding or remittance or, at the Company s discretion, such withholdings may be satisfied by reducing the
number of RSUs delivered to you. In the event of your neglect or refusal to provide the Company with your personal authorization
in writing to deduct the appropriate withholdings from your earnings, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver the relevant
RSUs to you. If the Company reduces the number of RSUs deliverable to you and less than the full value of an RSU is needed to satisfy
any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional share in cash in an
amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional RSU. 

Section
13.         Notice   

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing by (a) personal delivery, or (b) expedited, recognized
delivery service with proof of delivery, or (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested,
or (d) telecopy or email (provided that the telecopy or email is confirmed). Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder
shall be deemed to be delivered on the date which it was personally delivered, sent to the intended addressee, or, whether actually
received or not, on the third business day after it is deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid,
addressed to the person who is to receive it at the address which such person has theretofore specified by written notice delivered
in accordance herewith. The Company or the Grantee may change, at any time and from time to time, by written notice to the other,
the address specified for receiving notices. Until changed in accordance herewith, the Company s address for receiving notices
shall be Garmin Ltd., Attention: General Counsel, M hlentalstrasse 2, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Unless changed, the
Grantee s address for receiving notices shall be the last known address of the Grantee on the Company s records. It shall be the
Grantee s sole responsibility to notify the Company as to any change in his or her address. Such notification shall be made in
accordance with this Section 13. 

Section
14.          Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 6 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant s duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section
15.        Binding Effect   

This Award Agreement
shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

Section
16.         Governing Law   

This Award Agreement
and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of
Kansas without giving effect to the principles of the Conflict of Laws to the contrary.

leave. 

Section
3.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation
or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without

Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation on account of death or Disability, your RSUs that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation,

death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining RSUs;  

(b)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation during the period ( Change of Control Period ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first
anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than

Section
4.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees

investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but in no
event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
5.            Nontransferability of RSUs   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including,
unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal
separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her
lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
6.            Restrictive Covenants   

As a condition of this
Award Agreement, the Grantee's right to the RSUs, and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into
with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Nondisclosure of Award
Agreement Terms .  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose
any information concerning this Award Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee's legal and financial advisors
who agree to be bound by this Paragraph 6(a).  

(b)     Noncompetition.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant,
independent contractor or advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest
in any company, entity or person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other
location outside the United States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee's
knowledge) plans to conduct business. Nothing in this Section 6(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment
in and owning up to one-percent (1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange
or actively traded in an over-the-counter market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability
to control or influence the policy decisions of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.  

(c)     Noninterference.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
solicit, entice away, or otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier
or other similar business relation or (to the Grantee's knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(d)     Nonsolicitation.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
hire, recruit, employ, or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(e)     Confidentiality.  
The Grantee acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all
valuable and unique information and techniques acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their
businesses, operations, employees and customers ( Confidential Information ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential
Information is the sole and exclusive property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information
would cause damage to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to
disclose any Confidential Information or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result
or as a consequence of or through the Grantee's performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly
or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates in any manner to the Company's business. This obligation will continue
even though the Grantee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 6(e) shall apply in
addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee
and the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.
  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments
or information about the Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
about prospects for the future of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(g)     Remedy.   The
Grantee acknowledges the consideration provided herein (absent the Grantee's agreement to this Section 6) is more than the Company
is obligated to pay, and the Grantee further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and
monetary damages would not provide adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee
breaches any of the Grantee's obligations under this Section 6, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive
relief therefor, and in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall
be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition,

dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive.

may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of RSUs deliverable to you. If the
Company elects to reduce the number of RSUs deliverable to you and less than the full value of an RSU is needed to satisfy any

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful

Grantee:  

Date:  

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section
1.            Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section
2.            Grant of RSUs   

(a)    Calculation of Earned
Shares . As of the Date of Grant identified above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein and in the Plan, the opportunity to receive the product of (i) the Eligible Shares and (ii) the  Aggregate Vesting
Percentage  as calculated under Section 3, such product the   Earned Shares  . If the application of this
Section 2(a) results in a fractional Earned Share, the number of Earned Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.  

(b)    Vesting and Delivery of
Earned Shares . Provided you are employed (and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company on a
Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week) and
unless your right to receive the Earned Shares has been forfeited pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 below, then (subject to Section
13 below) you will be paid one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares within 30 days of the Certification Date (as defined on the Notice
of Grant), one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares on the first anniversary of the Certification Date and one-third of the Earned
Shares on the second anniversary of the Certification Date. If any of the first or second anniversaries of the Certification Date
is a Saturday or Sunday or any other non-business day, then you will be paid the Earned Shares payable on that date on the next
business day. For purposes of this Agreement, except where the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking
a Company-approved leave of absence, was employed on a Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during
the period of such Company-approved leave.  

Section
3.            Calculation of Aggregate Vesting
Percentage; Forfeiture of Unearned Shares   

The   Aggregate
Vesting Percentage   is the total of the individual vesting percentages for each of the achieved Performance Goals for
the Performance Year as set forth on Exhibit B. All Eligible Shares, if any, which, due to the Aggregate Vesting Percentage being
less than 100% do not become Earned Shares, shall be immediately forfeited as of the Certification Date. 

Section
4.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation
or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without
Cause, voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death, or Disability, the effect of such
Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation on account of death or Disability after the Certification Date, any Earned Shares that were forfeitable immediately
before such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all such Earned
Shares by delivery to you (or, after your death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted
Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining Earned Shares;  

(b)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation on account of death or Disability before the Certification Date, within 30 days following the Certification Date
the Company shall settle that number of your Eligible Shares which would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date
but for your death or Disability;  

(c)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation after the Certification Date and during the period (  Change of Control Period  ) commencing on
a Change of Control and ending on the first anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated
by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then any Earned Shares that
were forfeitable at the time of such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall immediately
settle all Earned Shares by delivery to you of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining
Earned Shares;  

(d)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation before the Certification Date and during the Change of Control Period, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated
by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then all of your Eligible Shares
that would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date but for such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become
Earned Shares and nonforfeitable and the Company shall within 30 days of the Certification Date settle all such Earned Shares
by delivery to you a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your Earned Shares;  

(e)   If you have a Termination
of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason other than for (i) death or Disability or (ii) under the circumstances described above
in Section 4(c) or (d), then your Eligible Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before the Certification
Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date), to the extent
forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation and to the extent permitted by the applicable Swiss law, shall
thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement;  

(f)   If you cease to be employed
on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other than as provided above in Sections 4(c) or (d), your Eligible Shares (to the extent
such Termination of Affiliation occurs before the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent such Termination of
Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date), to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on
a Full-Time Basis and to the extent permitted by applicable Swiss law, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall
have no further rights under this Award Agreement.  

Section
5.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares shall be acquired for his/her own account
for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but
in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
6.            Nontransferability of RSUs, Eligible
Shares and Earned Shares   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current
spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs or any
undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
7.            Restrictive Covenants   

To the extent permitted
by applicable law, as a condition of this Award Agreement, the Grantee's right to the RSUs or any Eligible Shares or Earned Shares,
and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees
to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Nondisclosure of Award
Agreement Terms .  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose
any information concerning this Award Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee's legal and financial advisors
who agree to be bound by this Paragraph 7(a).  

(b)     Noncompetition.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant,
independent contractor or advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest
in any company, entity or person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other
location outside the United States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee's
knowledge) plans to conduct business. Nothing in this Section 7(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment
in and owning up to one-percent (1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange
or actively traded in an over-the-counter market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability
to control or influence the policy decisions of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.  

(c)     Noninterference.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
solicit, entice away, or otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier
or other similar business relation or (to the Grantee's knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(d)     Nonsolicitation.  
During the Grantee's employment and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person,
hire, recruit, employ, or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(e)     Confidentiality.  
The Grantee acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all
valuable and unique information and techniques acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their
businesses, operations, employees and customers (  Confidential Information  ). The Grantee recognizes that the
Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential
Information would cause damage to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone
else to disclose any Confidential Information or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a
result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee's performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly
or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates in any manner to the Company's business. This obligation will continue
even though the Grantee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 7(e) shall apply in
addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee
and the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.
  The Grantee agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments
or information about the Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
about prospects for the future of the Company or any Subsidiary.  

(g)     Remedy.   The
Grantee acknowledges the consideration provided herein (absent the Grantee's agreement to this Section 7) is more than the Company
is obligated to pay, and the Grantee further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and
monetary damages would not provide adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee
breaches any of the Grantee's obligations under this Section 7, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive
relief therefor, and in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall
be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition,
this Award Agreement and all of Grantee's right hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages
in such activity and the Board shall be entitled on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require
the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by the Grantee's upon vesting of any Earned Shares to the Company and to require the
Grantee to repay any proceeds received at any time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of
any Earned Shares (plus interest on such amount from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced
from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal ) and to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in terminating
this Award Agreement and recovering such Shares and proceeds.  

Section
8.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the
RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares , and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights
with respect to any of the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, in both cases (i) and (ii) above, unless and
until the actual Shares underlying any Earned Shares have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize.

therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.

taxes on your behalf. Accordingly, the Company shall have the power to withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy any such federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax or social tax requirements. At the Company's discretion,
withholding may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of Shares deliverable
to you. If the Company elects to reduce the number of Shares deliverable to you and less than the full value of a Share is needed
to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional share in

while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 7 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable.

You have been granted
restricted stock units (  RSUs  ) relating to the shares, CHF 0.10 par value per share, of Garmin Ltd. (  Shares  ),
subject to the terms and conditions of the Garmin Ltd. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on June 5, 2009, on

Ltd. (the   Company  ), attached as Exhibit A. Accordingly, based on the satisfaction of the applicable performance-based
and time-based vesting conditions set forth in this Notice of Grant, Exhibit A and Exhibit B, the Company agrees to pay you Shares

The number of Shares that may be issued under this Agreement is a percentage (ranging from 0% to

in Exhibit B to this Agreement.   

At a meeting of the Company s Compensation Committee following the end of the Performance Year
(the   Certification Date  ), the Company s Compensation Committee will assess the achieved level of performance
and certify the goal(s) achievement.   

Any Earned Shares will be issued in three equal installments commencing within 30 days of the Certification
Date and each anniversary thereof, provided you are employed with the Company on each such date.   

In order to fully understand your rights
under the Plan (a copy of which is attached) and the Award Agreement (the   Award Agreement  ), attached as Exhibit
A, you are encouraged to read the Plan and this document carefully. Please refer to the Plan document for the definition of otherwise

Grantee: 

Date:  

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section
1.            Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section
2.            Grant of RSUs   

(a)    Calculation of Earned Shares . As of the Date of Grant identified
above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity to receive
the product of (i) the Eligible Shares and (ii) the  Aggregate Vesting Percentage  as calculated under Section 3, such
product the   Earned Shares  . If the application of this Section 2(a) results in a fractional Earned Share, the
number of Earned Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.     

(b)    Vesting and Delivery of Earned Shares . Provided you are employed
(and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company on a Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this
Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week) and unless your right to receive the Earned Shares
has been forfeited pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 below, then (subject to Section 13 below) you will be paid one-third (1/3) of the
Earned Shares within 30 days of the Certification Date (as defined on the Notice of Grant), one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares
on the first anniversary of the Certification Date and one-third of the Earned Shares on the second anniversary of the Certification
Date. If any of the first or second anniversaries of the Certification Date is a Saturday or Sunday or any other non-business day,
then you will be paid the Earned Shares payable on that date on the next business day. For purposes of this Agreement, except where
the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking a Company-approved leave of absence, was employed on a
Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during the period of such Company-approved leave.     

Section
3.            Calculation of Aggregate Vesting Percentage; Forfeiture of Unearned Shares   

The   Aggregate
Vesting Percentage   is the total of the individual vesting percentages for each of the achieved Performance Goals for
the Performance Year as set forth on Exhibit B. All Eligible Shares, if any, which, due to the Aggregate Vesting Percentage being
less than 100% do not become Earned Shares, shall be immediately forfeited as of the Certification Date. 

Section
4.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without
Cause, voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death, or Disability, the effect of such
Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
after the Certification Date, any Earned Shares that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation shall
thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you (or, after your
death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining Earned Shares;    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
before the Certification Date, within 30 days following the Certification Date the Company shall settle that number of your Eligible
Shares which would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date but for your death or Disability;    

(c)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation after the Certification
Date and during the period (  Change of Control Period  ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first
anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for
Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then any Earned Shares that were forfeitable at the time of such Termination
of Affiliation shall thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall immediately settle all Earned Shares by delivery to
you of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining Earned Shares;     

(d)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation before the Certification
Date and during the Change of Control Period, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other
than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then all of your Eligible Shares that would have become Earned Shares
as of the Certification Date but for such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become Earned Shares and non-forfeitable and
the Company shall within 30 days of the Certification Date settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you a number of unrestricted
Shares equal to the aggregate number of your Earned Shares;    

(e)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than for (i) death or Disability or (ii) under the circumstances described above in Section 4(c) or (d), then your Eligible
Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent
such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date), to the extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination
of Affiliation and to the extent permitted by the applicable Swiss law, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall
have no further rights under this Award Agreement;     

(f)   If you cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other
than as provided above in Sections 4(c) or (d), your Eligible Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before
the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date),
to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on a Full-Time Basis and to the extent permitted by applicable
Swiss law, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.    

Section
5.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares shall be acquired for his/her own account
for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but
in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
6.            Non-transferability of RSUs, Eligible Shares and Earned Shares   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current
spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs or any
undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
7.            Restrictive Covenants   

To the extent permitted
by applicable law, as a condition of this Award Agreement, the Grantee s right to the RSUs or any Eligible Shares or Earned Shares,
and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees
to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Non-disclosure of Award Agreement Terms .  The Grantee
agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose any information concerning this Award
Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee s legal and financial advisors who agree to be bound by this Paragraph
7(a).    

(b)     Non-competition.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractor or
advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest in any company, entity or
person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other location outside the United
States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee s knowledge) plans to conduct
business. Nothing in this Section 7(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment in and owning up to one-percent
(1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded in an over-the-counter
market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability to control or influence the policy decisions
of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.    

(c)     Non-interference.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, solicit, entice away, or
otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier or other similar business
relation or (to the Grantee s knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(d)     Non-solicitation.   During the Grantee s employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, hire, recruit, employ,
or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary.    

(e)     Confidentiality.   The Grantee acknowledges that it is
the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all valuable and unique information and techniques
acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their businesses, operations, employees and customers
(  Confidential Information  ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive
property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to disclose any Confidential Information
or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee s
performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates
in any manner to the Company s business. This obligation will continue even though the Grantee s employment with the Company or
a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 7(e) shall apply in addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality
agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee and the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.   The Grantee agrees not
to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments or information about the
Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or about prospects for the future
of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(g)     Remedy.   The Grantee acknowledges the consideration
provided herein (absent the Grantee s agreement to this Section 7) is more than the Company is obligated to pay, and the Grantee
further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and monetary damages would not provide
adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee breaches any of the Grantee s obligations
under this Section 7, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive relief therefor, and in particular, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies
they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition, this Award Agreement and all of Grantee s right
hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity and the Board shall be entitled
on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by
the Grantee s upon vesting of any Earned Shares to the Company and to require the Grantee to repay any proceeds received at any
time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any Earned Shares (plus interest on such amount
from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal )
and to recover all reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award Agreement and recovering such Shares
and proceeds.    

Section
8.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the
RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares , and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights
with respect to any of the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, in both cases (i) and (ii) above, unless and
until the actual Shares underlying any Earned Shares have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section
9.            No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section
10.          Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

Section
11.          Amendments    

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee s rights under this Award Agreement
without the Grantee s consent. 

Section
12.          Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 10 or 11 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section
13.          Withholding   

At the time any of
the Earned Shares are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding and social
taxes on your behalf. Accordingly, the Company shall have the power to withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy any such federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax or social tax requirements. At the Company s discretion,
withholding may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of Shares deliverable
to you. If the Company elects to reduce the number of Shares deliverable to you and less than the full value of a Share is needed
to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional share in
cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional Share. 

Section
14.          Notice   

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder
shall be effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee The Company or the Grantee may change, at any time and from time to time,
by written notice to the other, the address specified for receiving notices. Until changed in accordance herewith, the Company s
address for receiving notices shall be Garmin Ltd., Attention: General Counsel, M hlentalstrasse 2, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
Unless changed, the Grantee s address for receiving notices shall be the last known address of the Grantee on the Company s records.
It shall be the Grantee s sole responsibility to notify the Company as to any change in his or her address. Such notification shall
be made in accordance with this Section 14. 

Section
15.          Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 7 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant s duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section
16.          Binding Effect   

This Award Agreement
shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

Section
17.          Governing Law and Jurisdiction   

This
Award Agreement and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws

by mandatory forum requirements of the applicable law, the courts of the State of Kansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction with
regard to any disputes under the Plan.   The Company shall retain,
however, in addition the right to bring any claim in any other appropriate forum.

awards for the purpose of determining if those goals are achieved.  If the profitability goals are not achieved when factoring
in the expense of these awards, no awards for the profitability goals will be earned. Thus, it is possible for Garmin to report
operating income and operating margin that exceed the objectives, yet not achieve the performance objectives as outlined above.

Grantee:

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section 1.    Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section 2.    Grant of RSUs   

(a)    Calculation of Earned Shares . As of the Date of Grant identified
above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity to receive
the product of (i) the Eligible Shares and (ii) the  Aggregate Vesting Percentage  as calculated under Section 3, such
product the   Earned Shares  . If the application of this Section 2(a) results in a fractional Earned Share, the
number of Earned Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.     

(b)    Vesting and Delivery of Earned Shares . Provided you are employed
(and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company on a Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this
Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week) and unless your right to receive the Earned Shares
has been forfeited pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 below, then (subject to Section 13 below) one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares will
be paid to you within 30 days of the Certification Date (as defined on the Notice of Grant), one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares
will be paid to you on the first anniversary of the Certification Date and one-third of the Earned Shares will be paid to you on
the second anniversary of the Certification Date. If any of the first or second anniversaries of the Certification Date is a Saturday
or Sunday or any other non-business day, then you will be paid the Earned Shares payable on that date on the next business day.
For purposes of this Agreement, except where the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking a Company-approved
leave of absence, was employed on a Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during the period of such
Company-approved leave.     

Section 3.    Calculation of Aggregate
Vesting Percentage; Forfeiture of Unearned Shares   

The   Aggregate
Vesting Percentage   is the total of the individual vesting percentages for each of the achieved Performance Goals for
the Performance Year as set forth on Exhibit B. All Eligible Shares, if any, which, due to the Aggregate Vesting Percentage being
less than 100% do not become Earned Shares, shall be immediately forfeited as of the Certification Date. 

Section 4.    Effect of Termination
of Affiliation or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without
Cause (as defined in this Section 4), voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death, or
Disability, the effect of such Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion
of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
after the Certification Date, any Earned Shares that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation shall
thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you (or, after your
death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining Earned Shares;    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
before the Certification Date, within 30 days following the Certification Date the Company shall settle that number of your Eligible
Shares which would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date but for your death or Disability;    

(c)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation after the Certification
Date and during the period (  Change of Control Period  ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first
anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for
Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then any Earned Shares that were forfeitable at the time of such Termination
of Affiliation shall thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall immediately settle all Earned Shares by delivery to
you of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining Earned Shares;     

(d)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation before the Certification
Date and during the Change of Control Period, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other
than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then all of your Eligible Shares that would have become Earned Shares
as of the Certification Date but for such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become Earned Shares and non-forfeitable and
the Company shall within 30 days of the Certification Date settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you a number of unrestricted
Shares equal to the aggregate number of your Earned Shares;    

(e)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than for (i) death or Disability or (ii) under the circumstances described above in Section 4(c) or (d), then your Eligible
Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent
such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date), to the extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination
of Affiliation, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement;     

(f)   If you cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other
than as provided above in Sections 4(c) or (d), your Eligible Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before
the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date),
to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on a Full-Time Basis, shall thereupon automatically be
forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.    

(g)   Notwithstanding the definition of  Cause  set forth in
the Plan, for purposes of this Award Agreement, the term  Cause  means, without in any way limiting its definition
under common law (which is expressly included in this definition), any improper conduct by you which is materially detrimental
to the Company or any Subsidiary including, but not limited to:    

1.   Your conviction of, or a plea of guilty to, any indictable offence
or other crime that involves fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude;    

2.   Any willful action or omission by you which would constitute grounds
for immediate dismissal under the employment policies of the Company or the Subsidiary by which you are employed, including but
not limited to intoxication with alcohol or illegal drugs while on the premises on the Company or any Subsidiary, or any violation
of applicable sexual harassment laws or the internal sexual harassment policy of the Company or the Subsidiary by which you are
employed;    

3.   Your habitual neglect of duties, including but not limited to, repeated
unauthorized absences from work without reasonable excuse; or    

4.   Your willful or intentional material misconduct in the performance
of your duties that results in financial detriment to the Company or any Subsidiary.    

Section 5.    Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares shall be acquired for his/her own account
for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. If the Board so determines,
any share certificates issued pursuant to this Award Agreement shall bear a legend to the effect that the Shares have been so acquired.
The Company may, but in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities
laws or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration,
qualification, or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions
on the transfer of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel,
satisfactory to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities
laws or (b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

The Grantee also acknowledges
and agrees that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares will not be able to be transferred
or resold in Canada pursuant to the securities legislation of the Provinces and Territories of Canada except in accordance with
limited exemptions under applicable securities legislation and regulatory policy and compliance with the other requirements of
applicable law. 

Section 6.    Non-transferability of
RSUs, Eligible Shares and Earned Shares   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current
spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs or any
undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section 7.    Restrictive Covenants   

To the extent permitted
by applicable law, as a condition of this Award Agreement, the Grantee's right to the RSUs or any Eligible Shares or Earned Shares,
and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees
to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Non-disclosure of Award Agreement Terms .  The Grantee
agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose any information concerning this Award
Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee's legal and financial advisors who agree to be bound by this Paragraph
7(a).    

(b)     Non-competition.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in (whether as a shareholder, partner, member, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant, or in any other capacity) any company or organization with activities, products or services
involving:    

1.   Personal and team activity monitoring systems, including speed, distance
and cadence monitoring systems, motion analysis systems and associated watch displays and other displays and heart rate monitoring
systems and associated watch displays and other displays and prosthetics monitoring and control systems; or    

2.   Wireless communications systems and protocols designed for low power
applications;    

in any province,
state or country in which the Company or any Subsidiary conducts business (or, to the knowledge of the Grantee, any additional
location in which the Company of any Subsidiary intends to conduct business). 

Nothing in this
Section 7(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment in and owning up to one-percent (1%) of the common
stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded in an over-the-counter market;
provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability to control or influence the policy decisions of any
direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary. 

(c)     Non-interference.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, solicit, entice away, or
otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier or other similar business
relation or (to the Grantee's knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(d)     Non-solicitation.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, hire, recruit, employ,
or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary.    

(e)     Confidentiality.   The Grantee acknowledges that it is
the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all valuable and unique information and techniques
acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their businesses, operations, employees and customers
(  Confidential Information  ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive
property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to disclose any Confidential Information
or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee's
performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates
in any manner to the Company's business. This obligation will continue even though the Grantee's employment with the Company or
a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 7(e) shall apply in addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality
agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee and the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.   The Grantee agrees not
to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments or information about the
Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or about prospects for the future
of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(g)     Remedy.   The Grantee acknowledges the consideration
provided herein (absent the Grantee's agreement to this Section 7) is more than the Company is obligated to pay, and the Grantee
further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and monetary damages would not provide
adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee breaches any of the Grantee's obligations
under this Section 7, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive relief therefor, and in particular, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies
they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition, this Award Agreement and all of Grantee's right
hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity and the Board shall be entitled
on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by
the Grantee's upon vesting of any Earned Shares to the Company and to require the Grantee to repay any proceeds received at any
time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any Earned Shares (plus interest on such amount
from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal )
and to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award Agreement and recovering such Shares
and proceeds.    

Section 8.    Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates
for Shares pursuant to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall
have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive
any dividends or dividend equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions
made with respect to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise
any voting rights with respect to any of the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, in both cases (i) and (ii)
above, unless and until the actual Shares underlying any Earned Shares have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section 9.    No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section 10.    Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee's rights under this Award Agreement
without the Grantee's consent. 

Section 12.    Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 10 or 11 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section 13.    Withholding   

Notwithstanding Article 14
of the Plan, this Section 12 will apply to the Company's withholding obligations related to this Award Agreement. At the time any
of the Earned Shares are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding on
your behalf. Accordingly, and at the Company s discretion, such Federal, Provincial, local or foreign withholding tax requirements
may be satisfied by you providing specific written authorization to deduct from any earnings owed or accruing to you, the appropriate
sum of money required for such withholding or remittance or, at the Company s discretion, such withholdings may be satisfied
by reducing the number of Shares delivered to you. In the event of your neglect or refusal to provide the Company with your personal
authorization in writing to deduct the appropriate withholdings from your earnings, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver
the relevant Shares to you. If the Company reduces the number of Shares deliverable to you and less than the full value of a Share
is needed to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional
share in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional
Share. 

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder
shall be effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee The Company or the Grantee may change, at any time and from time to time,
by written notice to the other, the address specified for receiving notices. Until changed in accordance herewith, the Company's
address for receiving notices shall be Garmin Ltd., Attention: General Counsel, M hlentalstrasse 2, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
Unless changed, the Grantee's address for receiving notices shall be the last known address of the Grantee on the Company's records.
It shall be the Grantee's sole responsibility to notify the Company as to any change in his or her address. Such notification shall
be made in accordance with this Section 14. 

Section 15.    Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 7 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section 16.    Binding Effect   

This Award Agreement
shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

Section 17.    Governing Law   

This Award Agreement
and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of
Kansas without giving effect to the principles of the Conflict of Laws to the contrary.

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section
1.            Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section
2.            Grant of RSUs   

(a)    Calculation of Earned Shares . As of the Date of Grant identified
above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity to receive
the product of (i) the Eligible Shares and (ii) the  Aggregate Vesting Percentage  as calculated under Section 3, such
product the   Earned Shares  . If the application of this Section 2(a) results in a fractional Earned Share, the
number of Earned Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.     

(b)    Vesting and Delivery of Earned Shares . Provided you are employed
(and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company on a Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this
Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week) and unless your right to receive the Earned Shares
has been forfeited pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 below, then (subject to Section 13 below) you will be paid one-third (1/3) of the
Earned Shares within 30 days of the Certification Date (as defined on the Notice of Grant), one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares
on the first anniversary of the Certification Date and one-third of the Earned Shares on the second anniversary of the Certification
Date. If any of the first or second anniversaries of the Certification Date is a Saturday or Sunday or any other non-business day,
then you will be paid the Earned Shares payable on that date on the next business day. For purposes of this Agreement, except where
the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking a Company-approved leave of absence, was employed on a
Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during the period of such Company-approved leave.     

Section
3.            Calculation of Aggregate Vesting Percentage; Forfeiture of Unearned Shares   

The   Aggregate
Vesting Percentage   is the total of the individual vesting percentages for each of the achieved Performance Goals for
the Performance Year as set forth on Exhibit B. All Eligible Shares, if any, which, due to the Aggregate Vesting Percentage being
less than 100% do not become Earned Shares, shall be immediately forfeited as of the Certification Date. 

Section
4.            Effect of Termination of Affiliation or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without
Cause, voluntary resignation, change in employment status from full-time to part-time, death, or Disability, the effect of such
Termination of Affiliation or ceasing to be employed on a Full-Time Basis on all or any portion of the RSUs is as provided below. 

(a)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
after the Certification Date, any Earned Shares that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation shall
thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you (or, after your
death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining Earned Shares;    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
before the Certification Date, within 30 days following the Certification Date the Company shall settle that number of your Eligible
Shares which would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date but for your death or Disability;    

(c)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation after the Certification
Date and during the period (  Change of Control Period  ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the
first anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other
than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then any Earned Shares that were forfeitable at the time of such Termination
of Affiliation shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the Company shall immediately settle all Earned Shares by delivery to
you of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining Earned Shares;     

(d)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation before the Certification
Date and during the Change of Control Period, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other
than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then all of your Eligible Shares that would have become Earned Shares
as of the Certification Date but for such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become Earned Shares and nonforfeitable and
the Company shall within 30 days of the Certification Date settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you a number of unrestricted
Shares equal to the aggregate number of your Earned Shares;    

(e)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than for (i) death or Disability or (ii) under the circumstances described above in Section 4(c) or (d), then your Eligible
Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent
such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date), to the extent forfeitable immediately before such Termination
of Affiliation, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement;     

(f)   If you cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other
than as provided above in Sections 4(c) or (d), your Eligible Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before
the Certification Date) or your Earned Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs after the Certification Date),
to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on a Full-Time Basis, shall thereupon automatically be
forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.    

Section
5.            Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares shall be acquired for his/her own account
for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but
in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section
6.            Nontransferability of RSUs, Eligible Shares and Earned Shares   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current
spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs or any
undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section
7.            Restrictive Covenants   

To the extent permitted
by applicable law, as a condition of this Award Agreement, the Grantee s right to the RSUs or any Eligible Shares or Earned
Shares, and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into with the Company, the Grantee accepts and
agrees to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Nondisclosure of Award Agreement Terms .  The Grantee
agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose any information concerning this Award
Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee s legal and financial advisors who agree to be bound by this
Paragraph 7(a).    

(b)     Noncompetition.   During the Grantee s employment
and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company
or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractor
or advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest in any company, entity
or person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other location outside the
United States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee s knowledge) plans
to conduct business. Nothing in this Section 7(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment in and owning
up to one-percent (1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded
in an over-the-counter market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability to control or influence
the policy decisions of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.    

(c)     Noninterference.   During the Grantee s employment
and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company
or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, solicit, entice away,
or otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier or other similar
business relation or (to the Grantee s knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(d)     Nonsolicitation.   During the Grantee s employment
and until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company
or any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, hire, recruit, employ,
or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary.    

(e)     Confidentiality.   The Grantee acknowledges that it is
the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all valuable and unique information and techniques
acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their businesses, operations, employees and customers
(  Confidential Information  ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive
property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to disclose any Confidential Information
or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee s
performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates
in any manner to the Company s business. This obligation will continue even though the Grantee s employment with the
Company or a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 7(e) shall apply in addition to, and not in derogation of any other
confidentiality agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee and the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.   The Grantee agrees not
to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments or information about the
Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or about prospects for the future
of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(g)     Remedy.   The Grantee acknowledges the consideration
provided herein (absent the Grantee s agreement to this Section 7) is more than the Company is obligated to pay, and the
Grantee further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and monetary damages would not
provide adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee breaches any of the Grantee s
obligations under this Section 7, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive relief therefor, and in particular,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be precluded from pursuing any and
all remedies they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition, this Award Agreement and all of Grantee s
right hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity and the Board shall be
entitled on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require the Grantee to return any Shares obtained
by the Grantee s upon vesting of any Earned Shares to the Company and to require the Grantee to repay any proceeds received
at any time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any Earned Shares (plus interest on such
amount from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal )
and to recover all reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award Agreement and recovering such
Shares and proceeds.    

Section
8.            Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the
RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares , and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights
with respect to any of the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, in both cases (i) and (ii) above, unless and
until the actual Shares underlying any Earned Shares have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section
9.            No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section
10.         Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

Section
11.         Amendments    

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee s rights under this Award
Agreement without the Grantee s consent. 

Section
12.         Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 10 or 11 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section
13.         Withholding

the Earned Shares are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding and social
taxes on your behalf. Accordingly, the Company shall have the power to withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy any such federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax or social tax requirements. At the Company s
discretion, withholding may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of Shares
deliverable to you. If the Company elects to reduce the number of Shares deliverable to you and less than the full value of a Share
is needed to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional
share in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional
Share. 

Section

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder

Section
15.         Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 7 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant s duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to
modify the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section
16.         Binding Effect

shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

disputes under the Plan. The Company shall retain, however, in addition the right to bring any claim in any other appropriate forum. 

Section 18.       Shareholder Approval
and Company Clawback or Recoupment Policies

certain executive officers if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance
of the Company with any financial reporting requirements under any applicable securities laws. By accepting this grant,
whether or not any compensation is ultimately paid hereunder, you agree and consent to any forfeiture or required recovery or
reimbursement obligations of the Company with respect to any compensation paid to you that is forfeitable or recoverable by
the Company pursuant to Dodd-Frank and in accordance with any Company policies and procedures adopted by the Compensation
Committee in order to comply with Dodd Frank, as the same may be amended from time to time.

EXHIBIT A   

AGREEMENT:  

In consideration of
the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration paid by the Grantee to the Company,
the Grantee and the Company agree as follows: 

Section 1.    Incorporation of Plan   

All provisions of this
Award Agreement and the rights of the Grantee hereunder are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Plan and the powers
of the Board therein provided. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement but not defined shall have the meaning set forth
in the Plan. 

Section 2.    Grant of RSUs   

(a)    Calculation of Earned Shares . As of the Date of Grant identified
above, the Company grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the opportunity to receive
the product of (i) the Eligible Shares and (ii) the  Aggregate Vesting Percentage  as calculated under Section 3, such
product the   Earned Shares  . If the application of this Section 2(a) results in a fractional Earned Share, the
number of Earned Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.     

(b)    Vesting and Delivery of Earned Shares . Provided you are employed
(and at all times since the Date of Grant have been employed) by the Company on a Full-Time Basis (which, for purposes of this
Award Agreement, means regularly scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week) and unless your right to receive the Earned Shares
has been forfeited pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 below, then (subject to Section 13 below) you will be paid one-third (1/3) of the
Earned Shares within 30 days of the Certification Date (as defined on the Notice of Grant), one-third (1/3) of the Earned Shares
on the first anniversary of the Certification Date and one-third of the Earned Shares on the second anniversary of the Certification
Date. If any of the first or second anniversaries of the Certification Date is a Saturday or Sunday or any other non-business day,
then you will be paid the Earned Shares payable on that date on the next business day. For purposes of this Agreement, except where
the Board otherwise determines, a Grantee who, immediately before taking a Company-approved leave of absence, was employed on a
Full-Time Basis will be considered employed on a Full-Time Basis during the period of such Company-approved leave.     

Section 3.    Calculation of Aggregate
Vesting Percentage; Forfeiture of Unearned Shares   

The   Aggregate
Vesting Percentage   is the total of the individual vesting percentages for each of the achieved Performance Goals for
the Performance Year as set forth on Exhibit B. All Eligible Shares, if any, which, due to the Aggregate Vesting Percentage being
less than 100% do not become Earned Shares, shall be immediately forfeited as of the Certification Date. 

Section 4.    Effect of Termination
of Affiliation or Cessation as Full-Time Employee   

If you have a Termination
of Affiliation or cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason, including termination by the Company with or without

after the Certification Date, any Earned Shares that were forfeitable immediately before such Termination of Affiliation shall
thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall, promptly settle all such Earned Shares by delivery to you (or, after your
death, to your personal representative or designated beneficiary) a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number
of your remaining Earned Shares;    

(b)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation on account of death or Disability
before the Certification Date, within 30 days following the Certification Date the Company shall settle that number of your Eligible
Shares which would have become Earned Shares as of the Certification Date but for your death or Disability;    

(c)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation after the Certification
Date and during the period (  Change of Control Period  ) commencing on a Change of Control and ending on the first
anniversary of the Change of Control, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for
Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then any Earned Shares that were forfeitable at the time of such Termination
of Affiliation shall thereupon become non-forfeitable and the Company shall immediately settle all Earned Shares by delivery to
you of a number of unrestricted Shares equal to the aggregate number of your remaining Earned Shares;     

(d)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation before the Certification
Date and during the Change of Control Period, which Termination of Affiliation is initiated by the Company or a Subsidiary other
than for Cause, or initiated by the Grantee for Good Reason, then all of your Eligible Shares that would have become Earned Shares
as of the Certification Date but for such Termination of Affiliation shall thereupon become Earned Shares and non-forfeitable and

Shares equal to the aggregate number of your Earned Shares;    

(e)   If you have a Termination of Affiliation for Cause or for any reason
other than for (i) death or Disability or (ii) under the circumstances described above in Section 4(c) or (d), then your Eligible

of Affiliation, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement;     

(f)   If you cease to be employed on a Full-Time Basis for any reason other
than as provided above in Sections 4(c) or (d), your Eligible Shares (to the extent such Termination of Affiliation occurs before

to the extent forfeitable immediately before such cessation of employment on a Full-Time Basis, shall thereupon automatically be
forfeited and you shall have no further rights under this Award Agreement.    

Section 5.    Investment Intent   

The Grantee agrees
that the Shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of one or more tranches of Earned Shares shall be acquired for his/her own account
for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ) or other applicable securities laws. The Company may, but
in no event shall be required to, bear any expenses of complying with the 1933 Act, other applicable securities laws or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange or other regulatory authority in connection with the registration, qualification,
or transfer, as the case may be, of this Award Agreement or any Shares acquired hereunder. The foregoing restrictions on the transfer
of the Shares shall be inoperative if (a) the Company previously shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory
to it, to the effect that such transfer will not involve any violation of the 1933 Act and other applicable securities laws or
(b) the Shares shall have been duly registered in compliance with the 1933 Act and other applicable state or federal securities
laws. If this Award Agreement, or the Shares subject to this Award Agreement, are so registered under the 1933 Act, the Grantee
agrees that he will not make a public offering of the said Shares except on a national securities exchange on which the shares
of the Company are then listed. 

Section 6.    Non-transferability of
RSUs, Eligible Shares and Earned Shares   

No rights under this
Award Agreement relating to the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned,
or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, unless specifically approved by the Company, any purported transfer to a current
spouse or former spouse in connection with a legal separation or divorce proceeding. All rights with respect to the RSUs or any
undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares granted to the Grantee shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the Grantee. 

Section 7.    Restrictive Covenants   

To the extent permitted
by applicable law, as a condition of this Award Agreement, the Grantee's right to the RSUs or any Eligible Shares or Earned Shares,
and in addition to any restrictive agreements the Grantee may have entered into with the Company, the Grantee accepts and agrees
to be bound as follows: 

(a)     Non-disclosure of Award Agreement Terms .  The Grantee
agrees not to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time, nor authorize anyone to disclose any information concerning this Award
Agreement except (i) as required by law, or (ii) to the Grantee's legal and financial advisors who agree to be bound by this Paragraph
7(a).    

(b)     Non-competition.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not perform services as an employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractor or
advisor, or invest in, whether in the form of equity or debt, or otherwise have an ownership interest in any company, entity or
person that directly competes anywhere in the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, or in any other location outside the United
States, the United Kingdom or Taiwan where the Company or a Subsidiary conducts or (to the Grantee's knowledge) plans to conduct
business. Nothing in this Section 7(b) shall, however, restrict the Grantee from making an investment in and owning up to one-percent
(1%) of the common stock of any company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded in an over-the-counter
market; provided that such investment does not give the Grantee the right or ability to control or influence the policy decisions
of any direct competitor of the Company or a Subsidiary.    

(c)     Non-interference.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, solicit, entice away, or
otherwise interfere with any employee, customer, prospective customer, vendor, prospective vendor, supplier or other similar business
relation or (to the Grantee's knowledge) prospective business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(d)     Non-solicitation.   During the Grantee's employment and
until one year after the Grantee ceases being employed by or acting as a consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
any Subsidiary, the Grantee will not, either directly or indirectly through another business or person, hire, recruit, employ,
or attempt to hire, recruit or employ, or facilitate any such acts by others, any person then currently employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary.    

(e)     Confidentiality.   The Grantee acknowledges that it is
the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain as secret and confidential all valuable and unique information and techniques
acquired, developed or used by the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to their businesses, operations, employees and customers
(  Confidential Information  ). The Grantee recognizes that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive
property of the Company and its subsidiaries, and that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Grantee shall not at any time disclose or authorize anyone else to disclose any Confidential Information
or proprietary information that (A) is disclosed to or known by the Grantee as a result or as a consequence of or through the Grantee's
performance of services for the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) is not publicly or generally known outside the Company and (C) relates
in any manner to the Company's business. This obligation will continue even though the Grantee's employment with the Company or
a Subsidiary may have terminated. This paragraph 7(e) shall apply in addition to, and not in derogation of any other confidentiality
agreements that may exist, now or in the future, between the Grantee and the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(f)     No Detrimental Communications.   The Grantee agrees not
to disclose or cause to be disclosed at any time any untrue, negative, adverse or derogatory comments or information about the
Company or any Subsidiary, about any product or service provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, or about prospects for the future
of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

(g)     Remedy.   The Grantee acknowledges the consideration
provided herein (absent the Grantee's agreement to this Section 7) is more than the Company is obligated to pay, and the Grantee
further acknowledges that irreparable harm would result from any breach of this Section and monetary damages would not provide
adequate relief or remedy. Accordingly, the Grantee specifically agrees that, if the Grantee breaches any of the Grantee's obligations
under this Section 7, the Company and any Subsidiary shall be entitled to injunctive relief therefor, and in particular, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be precluded from pursuing any and all remedies
they may have at law or in equity for breach of such obligations. In addition, this Award Agreement and all of Grantee's right
hereunder shall terminate immediately the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity and the Board shall be entitled
on or after the first date on which the Grantee engages in such activity to require the Grantee to return any Shares obtained by
the Grantee's upon vesting of any Earned Shares to the Company and to require the Grantee to repay any proceeds received at any
time from the sale of Shares obtained by the Grantee pursuant to the vesting of any Earned Shares (plus interest on such amount
from the date received at a rate equal to the prime lending rate as announced from time to time in  The Wall Street Journal )
and to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in terminating this Award Agreement and recovering such Shares
and proceeds.    

Section 8.    Status of the Grantee   

The Grantee shall not
be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the Shares subject to this Award Agreement until such time as the
underlying Shares shall have been issued to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any Shares pursuant
to this Award Agreement until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such Shares shall have been duly listed
on any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. Grantee (i) is not entitled to receive any dividends or dividend
equivalents, whether such dividends would be paid in cash or in kind, or receive any other distributions made with respect to the
RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares , and (ii) does not have nor may he or she exercise any voting rights
with respect to any of the RSUs or any undelivered Eligible Shares or Earned Shares, in both cases (i) and (ii) above, unless and
until the actual Shares underlying any Earned Shares have been delivered pursuant to this Award Agreement. 

Section 9.    No Effect on Capital Structure   

This Award Agreement
shall not affect the right of the Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge,
consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. 

Section 10.    Adjustments   

Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any change in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration
therefor by the Company, by reason of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend, stock split, share combination or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the aggregate
number and class of Shares subject to this Award Agreement shall be automatically adjusted to accurately and equitably reflect
the effect thereon of such change; provided, however, that any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.
In the event of a dispute concerning such adjustment, the decision of the Board shall be conclusive. 

This Award Agreement
may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Grantee which specifically states that it is amending this Award
Agreement; provided that this Award Agreement is subject to the power of the Board to amend the Plan as provided therein. Except
as otherwise provided in the Plan, no such amendment shall materially adversely affect the Grantee's rights under this Award Agreement
without the Grantee's consent. 

Section 12.    Board Authority   

Any questions concerning
the interpretation of this Award Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under Sections 10 or 11 of this Award Agreement,
and any controversy which arises under this Award Agreement shall be settled by the Board in its sole discretion. 

Section 13.    Withholding   

At the time any of
the Earned Shares are delivered to you pursuant to this Award Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay withholding and social
taxes on your behalf. Accordingly, the Company shall have the power to withhold, or require you to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy any such federal, state, local or foreign withholding tax or social tax requirements. At the Company's discretion,
withholding may be taken from other compensation payable to you or may be satisfied by reducing the number of Shares deliverable
to you. If the Company elects to reduce the number of Shares deliverable to you and less than the full value of a Share is needed
to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, the Company will distribute to you the value of the remaining fractional share in
cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional Share. 

Whenever any notice
is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be given in writing Any notice required or permitted to be delivered hereunder
shall be effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee The Company or the Grantee may change, at any time and from time to time,
by written notice to the other, the address specified for receiving notices. Until changed in accordance herewith, the Company's
address for receiving notices shall be Garmin Ltd., Attention: General Counsel, M hlentalstrasse 2, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
Unless changed, the Grantee's address for receiving notices shall be the last known address of the Grantee on the Company's records.
It shall be the Grantee's sole responsibility to notify the Company as to any change in his or her address. Such notification shall
be made in accordance with this Section 14. 

Section 15.    Severability   

If any part of this
Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall
not serve to invalidate any part of this Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any part so declared unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which gives effect to the terms of such part to the fullest extent possible
while remaining lawful and valid. Additionally, if any of the covenants in Section 7 are determined by a court to be unenforceable
in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify
the duration or scope of such provision as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant, as so modified, to be enforceable. 

Section 16.    Binding Effect   

This Award Agreement
shall bind, and, except as specifically provided herein, shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 

Section 17.    Governing Law and Jurisdiction   

This
Award Agreement and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws
of the State of Kansas without giving effect to the principles of the Conflict of Laws to the contrary. Except as otherwise provided
by mandatory forum requirements of the applicable law, the courts of the State of Kansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction with
regard to any disputes under the Plan.   The Company shall retain,
however, in addition the right to bring any claim in any other appropriate forum.
