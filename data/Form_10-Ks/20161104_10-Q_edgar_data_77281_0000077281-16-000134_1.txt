PENNSYLVANIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016    

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Nature of Operations 
    
  Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust ( PREIT  or the  Company ) prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the included disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in PREIT s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of our operations, consolidated statements of other comprehensive income (loss), consolidated statements of equity and our consolidated statements of cash flows are included. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 
    
  PREIT, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. Our portfolio currently consists of a total of   31   properties in   11   states, including   23   operating shopping malls,   four   other operating retail properties and   four   development or redevelopment properties.   Two   of the development and redevelopment properties are classified as  mixed use  (a combination of retail and other uses),   one   is classified as  retail  (redevelopment of The Gallery at Market East into the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia ( Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia )), and   one   is classified as  other.  The above property counts do not include Beaver Valley Mall in Monaca, Pennsylvania because that property has been classified as  held for sale  as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  We hold our interest in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. ( PREIT Associates  or the  Operating Partnership ). We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of   September 30, 2016  , we held an   89.3%   controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, and consolidated it for reporting purposes. The presentation of consolidated financial statements does not itself imply that the assets of any consolidated entity (including any special-purpose entity formed for a particular project) are available to pay the liabilities of any other consolidated entity, or that the liabilities of any consolidated entity (including any special-purpose entity formed for a particular project) are obligations of any other consolidated entity. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, each of the limited partners has the right to redeem such partner s units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ) for cash or, at our election, we may acquire such OP Units in exchange for our common shares on a one-for-one basis, in some cases beginning one year following the respective issue dates of the OP Units and in other cases immediately. If all of the outstanding OP Units held by limited partners had been redeemed for cash as of   September 30, 2016  , the total amount that would have been distributed would have been   $191.4 million  , which is calculated using our   September 30, 2016   closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of   $23.03   per share multiplied by the number of outstanding OP Units held by limited partners, which was   8,312,676   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through two of our subsidiaries: PREIT Services, LLC ( PREIT Services ), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. ( PRI ), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties owned by partnerships in which we own an interest and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PREIT Services and PRI are consolidated. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer an expanded menu of services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law. 
    
  We evaluate operating results and allocate resources on a property-by-property basis, and do not distinguish or evaluate our consolidated operations on a geographic basis. Due to the nature of our operating properties, which involve retail shopping, we have concluded that our individual properties have similar economic characteristics and meet all other aggregation criteria.  Accordingly, we have aggregated our individual properties into   one   reportable segment. In addition, no single tenant accounts for   10%   or more of consolidated revenue, and none of our properties are located outside the United States.

Fair Value 
    
  Fair value accounting applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements. Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, these accounting requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 
    
  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
    
  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs might include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
    
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. 
    
  In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. We utilize the fair value hierarchy in our accounting for derivatives (Level 2) and financial instruments (Level 2) and in our reviews for impairment of real estate assets (Level 3) and goodwill (Level 3). 
    
  New Accounting Developments 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows, including classification guidance for distributions received from equity method investments. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, however early adoption is permitted. The standard requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The new guidance allows for entities to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. In addition, the guidance allows employers to withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate without causing the award to be classified as a liability. The guidance also stipulates that cash paid by an employer to a taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to record operating and financing leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and lessors to expense costs that are not initial direct leasing costs. This standard will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . The Company evaluated the application of ASU No. 2015-02 and concluded that no change was required to its accounting of its interests in less than wholly owned joint ventures, however, the Operating Partnership now meets the criteria as a variable interest entity. The Company s significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership,  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents     

and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. All of the Company s debt is also an obligation of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  In March 2015, the  FASB issued  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which intend to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance provides an amendment to the accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and we have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016.  This guidance is applied retrospectively to all prior periods.  Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs related to a note shall be reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note.  In this regard, debt issuance costs shall not be classified separately from related debt obligations as a deferred charge.  Therefore, as a result of adopting this guidance, the Company reclassified in its Consolidated Balance Sheets   $4.2 million   of debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, at December 31, 2015, from  Deferred costs and other assets, net  to  Mortgage loans payable,  and   $2.0 million   of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015, from  Deferred costs and other assets, net  to  Term loans,  thereby decreasing the carrying value of our recognized debt obligations for presentational purposes.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The objective of this new standard is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of this new standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt this standard. We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard might have on our consolidated financial statements, nor have we decided upon the method of adoption. 

2. REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES 
    
  Investments in real estate as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were comprised of the following:

Dispositions 
    
  The following table presents our dispositions for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

_________________________ 
   (1)    In connection with this transaction, we issued a mortgage loan to the buyer for   $17.0 million  , which is recorded in  Deferred costs and other assets, net  on our consolidated balance sheet.  The mortgage loan is secured by Wiregrass Commons Mall, bears interest at the rate of   6.00%   per annum and has a maturity date of April 2026.  
    
  Other Real Estate Activity 
    
  In September 2016, we sold an office building adjacent to Voorhees Town Center for   $4.0 million  , and recorded a gain of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  In July 2016, we sold a non operating parcel located at Beaver Valley Mall for   $0.8 million  , and recorded   no   gain or loss on the sale of this parcel. 
    
  In June 2016, we sold an operating parcel located at Monroe Retail Center for   $2.1 million  , and recorded a gain of   $0.6 million  . 
    
  In January 2016, we sold a non operating parcel located at Sunrise Plaza for   $2.0 million  , and recorded   no   gain or loss on the sale of this parcel. 
    
  Impairment of Assets 
    
  In September 2016 we recorded a loss on impairment of assets on Beaver Valley Mall, in Monaca, Pennsylvania of   $9.9 million   in connection with negotiations with a prospective buyer of the property.  In connection with these negotiations, we determined that the holding period of the property was less than previously estimated, which we concluded was a triggering event, leading us to conduct an analysis of possible impairment at this property.  Based upon the negotiations, we determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows, net of capital expenditures for the property, were less than the carrying value of the property, and recorded a loss on impairment of assets.  
    
  In June 2016 we recorded a loss on impairment of assets on Washington Crown Center, in Washington, Pennsylvania of   $14.1 million   in connection with negotiations with a prospective buyer of the property.  In connection with these negotiations, we determined that the holding period of the property was less than previously estimated, which we concluded was a triggering event, leading us to conduct an analysis of possible impairment at this property.  Based upon the negotiations, we determined

     Table of Contents     

that the estimated undiscounted cash flows, net of capital expenditures for the property, were less than the carrying value of the property, and recorded a loss on impairment of assets.  The property was sold in August 2016. 
    
  In March 2016 we recorded a loss on impairment of assets on an office building located in Voorhees, New Jersey of   $0.6 million   in connection with negotiations with a prospective buyer of the property.  In connection with these negotiations, we determined that the holding period of the property was less than previously estimated, which we concluded was a triggering event, leading us to conduct an analysis of possible impairment at this property.  Based upon the negotiations, we determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows, net of capital expenditures for the property, were less than the carrying value of the property, and recorded a loss on impairment of assets.  The property was sold in September 2016. 

3. INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS 
    
  The following table presents summarized financial information of the equity investments in our unconsolidated partnerships as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

_________________________ 
            (1)   
    The December 31, 2015 balance has been adjusted in connection with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2015-03  Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  (Note 1). 
               (2)   
    Excess investment represents the unamortized difference between our investment and our share of the equity in the underlying net investment in the unconsolidated partnerships. The excess investment is amortized over the life of the properties, and the amortization is included in  Equity in income of partnerships.  
       
  We record distributions from our equity investments as cash from operating activities up to an amount equal to the equity in income of partnerships. Amounts in excess of our share of the income in the equity investments are treated as a return of partnership capital and recorded as cash from investing activities.

4. FINANCING ACTIVITY 
    
  Credit Agreements 
    
  We have entered into four credit agreements (collectively, as amended, the  Credit Agreements ), as further discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015: (1) the 2013 Revolving Facility, (2) the 2014 7-Year Term Loan, (3) the 2014 5-Year Term Loan, and (4) the 2015 5-Year Term Loan. The 2014 7-Year Term Loan, the 2014 5-Year Term Loan and the 2015 5-Year Term Loan are collectively referred to as the  Term Loans.     
    
  On June 30, 2016, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust ( PREIT ), PREIT Associates, L.P. ( PREIT Associates ) and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. ( PRI  and, collectively with PREIT and PREIT Associates, the  Borrower ) entered into an Amendment (the  Amendment ) to the 2014 7-Year Term Loan. The Amendment increased potential borrowing under the 2014 7-Year Term Loan from $100.0 million to $250.0 million, and expanded the accordion feature of the 2014 7-Year Term Loan from up to $200.0 million to up to $400.0 million. Among other things, the Amendment lowered the interest rates in the applicable pricing grid and extended the termination date from January 7, 2021 to December 29, 2021. Pursuant to the Amendment, amounts borrowed under the 2014 7-Year Term Loan bear interest at a rate between 1.35% and 1.90% per annum, depending on PREIT s leverage, in excess of LIBOR, which is a reduction from the former range of 1.80% to 2.35%.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowed   $400.0 million   under the Term Loans and $  115.0 million   under the 2013 Revolving Facility (with   $7.4 million   pledged as collateral for a letter of credit at   September 30, 2016  ).   
  Interest expense and the deferred financing fee amortization related to the Credit Agreements for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Each of the Credit Agreements contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, which are identical to those contained in the other Credit Agreements, and which are described in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreements. Following recent property sales, the net operating income ( NOI ) from our remaining unencumbered properties is at a level such that pursuant to Unencumbered Debt Yield covenant (as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  ), the maximum unsecured amount that was available for us to borrow under the 2013 Revolving Facility as of   September 30, 2016   was   $201.6 million  .           
  Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreements bear interest at the rate specified below per annum, depending on our leverage, in excess of LIBOR, unless and until we receive an investment grade credit rating and provide notice to the administrative agent (the  Rating Date ), after which alternative rates would apply. In determining our leverage (the ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value), the capitalization rate used to calculate Gross Asset Value is   6.50%   for each property having an average sales per square foot of more than   $500   for the most recent period of 12 consecutive months, and (b)   7.50%   for any other property. The 2013 Revolving Facility is subject to a facility fee, which depends on leverage and is currently   0.25%  , and is recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

  Mortgage Loans 
    
  The aggregate carrying values and estimated fair values of mortgage loans based on interest rates and market conditions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The mortgage loans contain various customary default provisions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not in default on any of the mortgage loans. 
    
  Mortgage Loan Activity 
    
  In April 2016, we entered into a   $130.0 million   mortgage loan secured by Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The new mortgage loan bears interest at the rate of   2.00%   plus LIBOR, and has a maturity date of   April 2021  . The proceeds from the new mortgage loan were used to pay down a portion of the Credit Facility borrowings that were used to repay the previous   $141.2 million   mortgage loan. 
    
  In March 2016, we borrowed an additional   $9.0 million  , lowered the interest rate to   2.35%   plus LIBOR, and extended the maturity date to   March 2021   on the mortgage loan secured by Viewmont Mall in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $79.3 million   mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by Valley Mall in Hagerstown, Maryland using   $50.0 million   from our 2013 Revolving Facility and the balance from available working capital. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $32.8 million    mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by Lycoming Mall in Pennsdale, Pennsylvania in connection with the March 2016 sale of the property using proceeds from the sale and available working capital. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $28.1 million   mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia in connection with the March 2016 sale of the property using proceeds from the sale. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We follow established risk management policies designed to limit our interest rate risk on our interest bearing liabilities, as further discussed in note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

5. CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
    
  Cash paid for interest was   $50.2 million   (net of capitalized interest of   $2.2 million  ) and   $56.2 million   (net of capitalized interest of less than   $1.6 million  ) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In our statement of cash flows, we show cash flows on our revolving facility on a net basis.  Aggregate borrowings on our 2013 Revolving Facility were   $250.0 million   and   $290.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,

respectively.  Aggregate paydowns were   $200.0 million   and   $230.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In connection with the sale of Gadsden Mall, New River Valley Mall and Wiregrass Commons, we issued a mortgage note to the buyer in the amount of   $17.0 million  . The mortgage loan is secured by Wiregrass Commons Mall, bears interest at the rate of   6.00%   per annum and has a maturity date of April 2026. 

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unaccrued contractual and other commitments related to our capital improvement projects and development projects of   $56.5 million  , including commitments related to the redevelopment of the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, in the form of tenant allowances and contracts with general service providers and other professional service providers. In addition, our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, has jointly and severally guaranteed the obligations of the joint venture we formed with Macerich to develop the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia to commence and complete a comprehensive redevelopment of that property costing not less than $300.0 million within 48 months after commencement of construction. 
    
  Provision for Employee Separation Expense 
    
  In 2016 and 2015, we terminated the employment of certain employees. In connection with the departure of those employees, we recorded   $0.2 million   and   $1.4 million   of employee separations expenses, respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other 
    
  In 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Springfield Town Center in Springfield, Virginia, we recorded a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of additional consideration that the seller would potentially be eligible to receive (the  Earnout ).  As of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Earnout was   $8.6 million  . As of September 30, 2016, based on revised leasing assumptions and other factors, we revised our estimate and determined that the entire contingent liability associated with the Earnout should be eliminated.  The change in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability is recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 

7. DERIVATIVES 
    
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on our interest bearing liabilities. We attempt to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies, including the use of financial instruments such as derivatives. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our outstanding derivatives have been designated under applicable accounting authority as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as, and that qualify as, cash flow hedges is recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. To the extent these instruments are ineffective as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in  Interest expense, net.   We recognize all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amount of the derivative assets is reflected in  Deferred costs and other assets, net,  the amount of the associated liabilities is reflected in  Accrued expenses and other liabilities  and the amount of the net unrealized income or loss is reflected in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  in the accompanying balance sheets.  
    
  Amounts reported in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  that are related to derivatives will be reclassified to  Interest expense, net  as interest payments are made on our corresponding debt. During the next 12 months, we estimate that    $4.0 million   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense in connection with derivatives. The amortization of these amounts could be accelerated in the event that we repay amounts outstanding on the debt instruments and do not replace them with new borrowings.

Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  As of September 30, 2016  , we had entered into   26   interest rate swap agreements with a weighted average base interest rate of   1.25%   on a notional amount of   $627.7 million  ,   maturing on various dates through   March 2021  , and   one   forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a base interest rate of   1.42%   on a notional amount of   $48.0 million  , which will be effective starting January 2018 and will mature in   February 2021  .  
    
  We entered into these interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the interest payments associated with our issuances of variable interest rate long term debt. We have assessed the effectiveness of these interest rate swap agreements as hedges at inception and on a quarterly basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , except as set forth below, we considered these interest rate swap agreements to be highly effective as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swap agreements are net settled monthly.    
    
  In March 2016, in connection with the sale of, and repayment of, the mortgage loan secured by Lycoming Mall, we recorded a loss on hedge ineffectiveness of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016   includes a net loss of   $1.7 million   relating to forward starting swaps that we cash settled in prior years that are being amortized over   10   year periods commencing on the closing dates of the debt instruments that are associated with these settled swaps.

The following table summarizes the terms and estimated fair values of our interest rate swap derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The notional values provide an indication of the extent of our involvement in these instruments, but do not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks.  

_________________________ 
            (1)   
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and we did not have any significant recurring fair value measurements related to derivative instruments using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
    
  We have agreements with some of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision pursuant to which, if our entity that originated such derivative instruments defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not in default on any of our derivative obligations. 
    
  We have an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan covenant provisions of our loan agreement with a lender affiliated with the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in our being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which excludes accrued interest but includes any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements, was   $6.4 million  . If we had breached any of the default provisions in these agreements as of   September 30, 2016  , we might have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value (including accrued interest) of   $7.0 million  . We had not breached any of these provisions as of   September 30, 2016  . 

8. HISTORIC TAX CREDITS 
  In the second quarter of 2012, we closed a transaction with a counterparty (the  Counterparty ) related to the historic rehabilitation of an office building located at 801 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the  Project ), which has two stages of development.  The Counterparty contributed equity of   $5.5 million   to the first stage through December 31, 2013 and   $5.8 million   to the second stage through September 30, 2014.  In exchange for its contributions into the Project, the Counterparty received substantially all of the historic rehabilitation tax credits associated with the Project as a distribution. The Counterparty s contributions, other than the amounts allocated to a put option (whereby we might be obligated or entitled to repurchase the Counterparty s ownership interest in the Project), are classified as  Accrued expenses and other liabilities  and recognized as  Other income  in the consolidated financial statements as our obligation to deliver tax credits is relieved.  
  The tax credits are subject to a five year credit recapture period, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning one year after the completion of the Project, of which the first stage was completed in the second quarter of 2012, and the second stage was completed in the second quarter of 2013. Our obligation to the Counterparty with respect to the tax credits is ratably relieved annually in the third quarter of each year, upon the expiration of each portion of the recapture period and the satisfaction of other revenue recognition criteria. We recognized the contribution received of   $0.9 million    from the Counterparty as  Other income  in the consolidated statements of operations related to the fourth recapture period of the first stage and   $1.0 million   related to the third recapture period of the first stage in each of the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We recognized the contribution received of   $0.9 million   related to the third recapture period of the second stage, and   $0.9 million   related to the second recapture period of the second stage in each of the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We also recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, of priority returns earned by the Counterparty in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  
   18 

     Table of Contents     

In the aggregate, we recorded net income of   $1.8 million   to  Other income  in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the Project in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
    
  The following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
    
  We currently own interests in   31   retail properties in   11   states, of which   27   are operating properties, three are development properties, and   one   is under redevelopment. The   27   operating properties include   23   shopping malls and   four   other operating retail properties, have a total of   22.1 million   square feet and are located in   10   states. We and partnerships in which we own an interest own   16.5 million   square feet at these properties (excluding space owned by anchors). The above property counts do not include Beaver Valley Mall in Monaca, Pennsylvania because that property has been classified as  held for sale  as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  There are   21   operating retail properties in our portfolio that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. These consolidated operating properties have a total of   18.0 million   square feet, of which we own   13.7 million   square feet. The   six   operating retail properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties have a total of   4.1 million   square feet, of which   2.8 million   square feet are owned by such partnerships. 
    
  The development and redevelopment portion of our portfolio contains   four   properties in two states, with two classified as  mixed use  (a combination of retail and other uses), one is classified as  retail  (redevelopment of The Gallery at Market East into the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia ( Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia )), and one classified as  other.  
    
  Our primary business is owning and operating retail shopping malls, which we primarily do through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. ( PREIT Associates ). We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through PREIT Services, LLC ( PREIT Services ), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. ( PRI ), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties in which we own interests through partnerships with third parties and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer additional services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law. 
    
  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.9   million, an increase of   $39.2 million   compared to net loss of   $36.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   This increase was primarily due to a decrease of impairment of assets from $51.4 million in three months ended September 30, 2015 to $9.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a $13.6 million decrease in operating expenses (primarily due to property sales) and a decrease of $2.5 million in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of real estate of $12.4 million, and an $8.2 million decrease in base rent as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.     
    
  Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $14.0 million  ,   an increase   of   $98.9 million   compared to net loss of   $84.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   This increase was primarily due to a decrease in impairment of assets from $86.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $24.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $23.0 million of gains on the sales of real estate assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreases of $13.7 million and $7.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and interest expense, respectively, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $3.4 million in acquisition costs primarily related to Springfield Town Center in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, and $1.8 million of shareholder activist defense costs incurred in 2015 that did not recur in 2016.  
    
  We evaluate operating results and allocate resources on a property-by-property basis, and do not distinguish or evaluate our consolidated operations on a geographic basis. Due to the nature of our operating properties, which involve retail shopping, we have concluded that our individual properties have similar economic characteristics and meet all other aggregation criteria.  Accordingly, we have aggregated our individual properties into one reportable segment. In addition, no single tenant accounts for 10% or more of consolidated revenue, and none of our properties are located outside the United States.

Current Economic Conditions and Our Near Term Capital Needs 
    
  The conditions in the economy have caused relatively slow job growth and have caused fluctuations and variations in retail sales, business and consumer confidence, and consumer spending on retail goods. As a result, the sales and profit performance of certain retailers has fluctuated, and in some cases, has led to bankruptcy filings by them. We continue to adjust our plans and actions to take into account the current environment as it evolves. In particular, we continue to contemplate ways to maintain or reduce our leverage through a variety of means available to us, subject to and in accordance with the terms of our Credit Agreements. These steps might include (i) obtaining capital from joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets with institutional investors, private equity investors or other REITs, or through sales of properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans and application of the excess proceeds to debt reduction, and (ii) obtaining equity capital, including through the issuance of common or preferred equity securities if market conditions are favorable, or through other actions. 
    
  Capital Improvements, Redevelopment and Development Projects 
    
  At our operating properties, we might engage in various types of capital improvement projects. Such projects vary in cost and complexity, and can include building out new or existing space for individual tenants, upgrading common areas or exterior areas such as parking lots, or redeveloping the entire property, among other projects. Project costs are accumulated in  Construction in progress  on our consolidated balance sheet until the asset is placed into service, and amounted to   $98.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In 2014, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with The Macerich Company ( Macerich ) to redevelop the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia.  As we redevelop the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, operating results in the short term, as measured by sales, occupancy, real estate revenue, property operating expenses, NOI and depreciation, will likely be negatively affected until the newly constructed space is completed, leased and occupied. 
    
  We are also engaged in several types of development projects. However, we do not expect to make any significant investment in these projects in the short term, other than the redevelopment of the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that might change in subsequent periods. In preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including historical experience, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Management has also considered events and changes in property, market and economic conditions, estimated future cash flows from property operations and the risk of loss on specific accounts or amounts in determining its estimates and judgments. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may affect comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. The estimates and assumptions made by management in applying Critical Accounting Policies have not changed materially during 2016 or 2015 except as otherwise noted, and none of these estimates or assumptions have proven to be materially incorrect or resulted in our recording any significant adjustments relating to prior periods. We will continue to monitor the key factors underlying our estimates and judgments, but no change is currently expected. 
  For additional information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies, see  Critical Accounting Policies  in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Asset Impairment  
    
  Real estate investments and related intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property might not be recoverable. A property to be held and used is considered impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows, less estimated capital expenditures, to be generated by the property, undiscounted and without interest charges, are less than the carrying value of the property. This estimate takes into consideration factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. In addition, these estimates may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents     

when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset are under consideration or when a range of possible values is estimated.  
  The determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by management, including the expected course of action at the balance sheet date that would lead to such cash flows. Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in the anticipated action to be taken with respect to the property could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could materially affect our net income. To the extent estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value of the property.  
  Assessment of our ability to recover certain lease related costs must be made when we have a reason to believe that the tenant might not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected. This requires us to make estimates as to the recoverability of such costs. 
    
  See      Results of Operations  for a description of the losses on impairment of assets recorded during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
    
  New Accounting Developments 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows, including classification guidance for distributions received from equity method investments. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, however early adoption is permitted. The standard requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The new guidance allows for entities to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. In addition, the guidance allows employers to withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate without causing the award to be classified as a liability. The guidance also stipulates that cash paid by an employer to a taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to record operating and financing leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and lessors to expense costs that are not initial direct leasing costs. This standard will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . The Company evaluated the application of ASU No. 2015-02 and concluded that no change was required to its accounting of its interests in less than wholly owned joint ventures, however, the Operating Partnership now meets the criteria as a variable interest entity. The Company s significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. All of the Company s debt is also an obligation of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  In March 2015,  the  FASB issued  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which intend to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance provides an amendment to the accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and we have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016.  This guidance is applied retrospectively to all prior periods.  Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs related to a note shall be reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note.  In this regard, debt issuance costs shall not be classified separately from related debt obligations as a deferred charge.  Therefore, as a result of adopting this guidance, the Company reclassified in its Consolidated Balance Sheets   $4.2 million   of debt issuance costs, net of

     Table of Contents     

accumulated amortization, at December 31, 2015, from  Deferred costs and other assets, net  to  Mortgage loans payable,  and   $2.0 million   of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015, from  Deferred costs and other assets, net  to  Term loans,  thereby decreasing the carrying value of our recognized debt obligations for presentational purposes.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The objective of this new standard is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of this new standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt this standard. We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard might have on our consolidated financial statements, nor have we decided upon the method of adoption.

Overview 
    
  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.9 million  , an increase of   $39.2 million   compared to net loss of   $36.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   This increase was primarily due to a decrease of impairment of assets from $51.4 million in three months ended September 30, 2015 to $9.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a $13.6 million decrease in operating expenses (primarily due to property sales) and a decrease of $2.5 million in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of real estate of $12.4 million, and an $8.2 million decrease in base rent as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.     
    
  Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $14.0 million  ,   an increase   of   $98.9 million   compared to net loss of   $84.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   This increase was primarily due to a decrease in impairment of assets from $86.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $24.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $23.0 million of gains on the sales of real estate assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreases of $13.7 million and $7.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and interest expense, respectively, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $3.4 million in acquisition costs primarily related to Springfield Town Center in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, and $1.8 million of shareholder activist defense costs incurred in 2015 that did not recur in 2016.  

The following table sets forth our results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The amounts in the preceding tables reflect our consolidated properties and our unconsolidated properties. Our unconsolidated properties are presented under the equity method of accounting in the line item  Equity in income of partnerships.  
    
  Real Estate Revenue 
    
  Real estate revenue   decreased   by $  8.6 million  , or   8%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

a decrease of $0.5 million in Same Store (properties owned for the full periods presented) expense reimbursements due to a decrease in real estate tax expense (see     Property Operating Expenses    partially offset by  

an increase of $1.7 million in Same Store lease terminations, including a combined termination fee of $2.8 million recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from one tenant located at two of our properties; 

27 

     Table of Contents     

an increase of $0.8 million in Same Store base rent due to increases from new store openings and lease renewals with higher base rental amounts, with notable increases at Springfield Town Center and Moorestown Mall. 
       
  Real estate revenue   decreased   by   $14.0 million  , or   5%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

a decrease of $2.6 million in Same Store expense reimbursements, due to decreases in utility expense and snow removal expense (see     Property Operating Expenses   ), as well as lower occupancy at some properties, and rental concessions made to some tenants under which the terms of their leases were modified such that they no longer pay expense reimbursements; partially offset by 

an increase of $11.7 million in real estate revenue from the acquisition of Springfield Town Center in March 2015; 

an increase of $1.6 million in Same Store base rent due to increases from new store openings and lease renewals with higher base rental amounts, with notable increases at Moorestown Mall and Cherry Hill Mall; 

an increase of $1.5 million in Same Store lease terminations, including a combined $2.8 million received from one tenant located at two of our properties in the nine months ended September 30, 2016; and 

an increase of $0.4 million in Same Store partnership marketing revenue. 
        
  Property Operating Expenses 
    
  Property operating expenses   decreased   by   $5.5 million   or   13%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

a decrease of $5.2 million in property operating expenses related to properties and real estate interests sold in 2015 and 2016; 

a decrease of $0.7 million in Same Store real estate tax expense due to a real estate tax appeal refund at one property; and 

a decrease of $0.3 million in Same Store bad debt expense primarily due to the collection of previously reserved amounts from a bankrupt tenant; partially offset by 

an increase of $0.7 million in Same Store common area maintenance expense due to $0.2 million of increased personnel costs, a $0.2 million increase in common area utilities expense as a result of warmer temperatures across the Mid-Atlantic States, where many of our properties are located, resulting in higher electricity usage compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increases in janitorial and loss prevention expenses.   
       
  Property operating expenses   decreased   by   $10.0 million   or   8%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

a decrease of $1.0 million in Same Store non-common area utility expense as a result of warmer temperatures across the Mid-Atlantic States during the first quarter of 2016, resulting in lower electricity usage compared to the first quarter of 2015.  In addition, there was a significant increase in electric rates during February 2015 due to extreme cold weather that particularly affected our properties located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland that did not recur in 2016. These effects were partially offset by a warmer summer in the three months ended September 30,  2016;   

a decrease of $0.9 million in Same Store common area maintenance expense, including a decrease of $0.8 million in snow removal expense. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, weather across the Mid-Atlantic States, where many of our properties are located,  was milder and drier compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015; and 

a decrease of $0.4 million in Same Store bad debt expense; partially offset by

an increase of $5.0 million in property operating expenses from the acquisition of Springfield Town Center in March 2015. 
       
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased   by $  9.3 million  , or   26%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

a decrease of $6.7 million due to a change in an estimated contingent liability recorded in connection with a property acquisition; and 

an increase of $2.5 million due to a higher asset base resulting from capital improvements related to new tenants at our Same Store properties, as well as accelerated amortization of capital improvements associated with several store closings in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by   $13.7 million  , or   13%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to: 

a decrease of $8.7 million  due to a change in an estimated contingent liability recorded in connection with a property acquisition; partially offset by 

an increase of $5.5 million related to the March 2015 acquisition of Springfield Town Center; and 

an increase of  $4.6 million due to a higher asset base resulting from capital improvements related to new tenants at our Same Store properties, as well as accelerated amortization of capital improvements associated with store closings in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
       
  Impairment of Assets 
    
  Impairment of assets for the three months ended   September 30,   2016 consisted of   $9.9 million   in connection with sale negotiations with a prospective buyer of Beaver Valley Mall located in Monaca, Pennsylvania. Impairment of assets for the three months ended   September 30,   2015 included $39.1 million recorded on Voorhees Town Center in Voorhees, New Jersey and $12.3 million recorded on Lycoming Mall in Pennsdale, Pennsylvania. 
    
  Impairment of assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016 and 2015 included the items noted above, as well as $14.1 million recorded in June 2016 in connection with sale negotiations with a prospective buyer of the Washington Crown Center in  Washington, Pennsylvania, and $0.6 million recorded in March 2016 in connection with sale negotiations with a prospective buyer of an office building that we owned in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 2015, $7.5 million was recorded in connection with the sale of Uniontown Mall in Uniontown, Pennsylvania and an aggregate of $27.3 million on Gadsden Mall in Gadsden, Alabama, New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia and Wiregrass Commons Mall in Dothan, Alabama. 
    
  Acquisition Costs and Other Expenses 
    
  Acquisition costs and other expenses were $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Included in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.4 million of projects costs and $0.6 million of professional fees related to property dispositions. 
    
  Acquisition costs and other expenses were $1.4 million and $5.7 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were acquisition costs of $3.4 million and shareholder activist defense costs of $1.8 million.

Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense   decreased   by   $2.5 million  , or   13%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates and average debt balances. Our weighted average effective borrowing rate was   4.19%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.40%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our weighted average debt balance was   $1,721.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $135.6 million, compared to   $1,857.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Interest expense decreased by   $7.3 million  , or   12%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower interest payments due to the sales of properties that were mortgaged.  Our weighted average effective borrowing rate was   4.21%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.69%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our weighted average debt balance was   $1,765.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,762.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . We also recorded a loss on hedge ineffectiveness of $0.5 million, a $0.8 million prepayment penalty and $0.2 million of accelerated amortization of financing costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Equity in Income of Partnerships 
    
  Equity in income of partnerships increased by   $2.3 million  , or   95%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in equity in income from the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia due to recovery of previously reserved amounts, and Gloucester Premium Outlets, which opened in 2015, partially offset by decreased income resulting from property sales in 2015. 
    
  Equity in income of partnerships increased by   $6.2 million  , or   96%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in equity in income from the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia due to recovery of previously reserved amounts, Gloucester Premium Outlets, which opened in 2015, a decrease in depreciation and amortization from Metroplex, partially offset by income from properties sold in 2015. 

NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  Overview 
    
  The preceding discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for the periods presented. We also use Net Operating Income (NOI) and Funds from Operations (FFO) which are non-GAAP financial measures, to supplement our analysis and discussion of our operating performance:   

We believe that NOI is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. When we use and present NOI, we also do so on a same store (Same Store NOI) and non-same store (Non Same Store NOI) basis to differentiate between properties that we have owned for the full periods presented and properties acquired, sold or under redevelopment during those periods. Furthermore, our use and presentation of NOI combines NOI from our consolidated properties and NOI attributable to our share of unconsolidated properties in order to arrive at total NOI. We believe that this is also helpful information because it reflects the pro rata contribution from our unconsolidated properties that are owned through investments accounted for under GAAP as equity in income of partnerships. See  Unconsolidated Properties and Proportionate Financial Information  below. 

We believe that FFO is also helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as gains on sales of operating real estate and depreciation and amortization of real estate, among others.  In addition to FFO and FFO per diluted share and OP Unit, we also present FFO, as adjusted  and FFO per diluted share and OP Unit, as adjusted to show the effect of items such as accelerated amortization of financing costs and prepayment penalties, acquisition costs, provision for employee separation expense, and loss on hedge ineffectiveness.   
       
  NOI and FFO are commonly used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance in the real estate industry, and we use them as supplemental non-GAAP measures to compare our performance between different periods and to compare our performance to that of our industry peers.  Our computation of NOI, FFO and other non-GAAP financial measures, such as Same Store NOI, Non Same  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents     

Store NOI, NOI attributable to our share of unconsolidated properties, and FFO, as adjusted, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by our industry peers. None of these measures are measures of performance in accordance with GAAP, and they have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be considered as alternative measures of our net income, operating performance, cash flow or liquidity.  They are not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.  Please see below for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and their respective reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 

Unconsolidated Properties and Proportionate Financial Information 
    
  The non-GAAP financial measures presented below incorporate financial information attributable to our share of unconsolidated properties. This proportionate financial information is non-GAAP financial information, but we believe that it is helpful information because it reflects the pro rata contribution from our unconsolidated properties that are owned through investments accounted for under GAAP using the equity method of accounting.  Under such method, earnings from these unconsolidated partnerships are recorded in our statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP under the caption entitled  Equity in income of partnerships.  
    
  To derive the proportionate financial information reflected in the tables below as  unconsolidated,  we multiplied the percentage of our economic interest in each partnership on a property-by-property basis by each line item.  Under the partnership agreements relating to our current unconsolidated partnerships with third parties, we own a 25% to 50% economic interest in such partnerships, and there are generally no provisions in such partnership agreements relating to special non-pro rata allocations of income or loss, and there are no preferred or priority returns of capital or other similar provisions.  While this method approximates our indirect economic interest in our pro rata share of the revenue and expenses of our unconsolidated partnerships, we do not have a direct legal claim to the assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses of the unconsolidated partnerships beyond our rights as an equity owner in the event of any liquidation of such entity.  Our percentage ownership is not necessarily indicative of the legal and economic implications of our ownership interest. Accordingly, NOI and FFO results based on our share of the results of unconsolidated partnerships do not represent cash generated from our investments in these partnerships. 
    
  We have determined that we hold a noncontrolling interest in each of our unconsolidated partnerships, and account for such partnerships using the equity method of accounting, because: 

Except for two properties that we co-manage with our partner, all of the other entities are managed on a day-to-day basis by one of our other partners as the managing general partner in each of the respective partnerships. In the case of the co-managed properties, all decisions in the ordinary course of business are made jointly. 

The managing general partner is responsible for establishing the operating and capital decisions of the partnership, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. 

All major decisions of each partnership, such as the sale, refinancing, expansion or rehabilitation of the property, require the approval of all partners. 

Voting rights and the sharing of profits and losses are generally in proportion to the ownership percentages of each partner. 
       
  We hold legal title to a property owned by one of our unconsolidated partnerships through a tenancy in common arrangement. For this property, such legal title is held by us and another entity, and each has an undivided interest in title to the property. With respect this property, under the applicable agreements between us and the entity with ownership interests, we and such other entity have joint control because decisions regarding matters such as the sale, refinancing, expansion or rehabilitation of the property require the approval of both us and the other entity owning an interest in the property. Hence, we account for this property like our other unconsolidated partnerships using the equity method of accounting. The balance sheet items arising from this property appear under the caption  Investments in partnerships, at equity.  
    
  For further information regarding our unconsolidated partnerships, see note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Net Operating Income ( NOI )  
    
  NOI (a non-GAAP measure) is derived from real estate revenue (determined in accordance with GAAP, including lease termination revenue), minus property operating expenses (determined in accordance with GAAP), plus our pro rata share of revenue and property operating expenses of our unconsolidated partnership investments. NOI excludes other income, general and administrative expenses, provision for employee separation expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of interest in non operating real estate, gain on sale of interest in real estate, impairment of assets, acquisition costs and other expenses. 
    
  Same Store NOI is calculated using retail properties owned for the full periods presented and excludes properties acquired or disposed of or under redevelopment during the periods presented. Non Same Store NOI is calculated using the retail properties excluded from the calculation of Same Store NOI. Springfield Town Center is included in Same Store NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and excluded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

     Table of Contents     

Total NOI decreased by   $1.4 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a decrease of   $4.6 million   in NOI from Non Same Store properties.  This decrease is primarily due to properties sold in 2015 and 2016 partially offset by recovery of previously reserved amounts. Same Store NOI increased by   $3.3 million   primarily driven by an incremental $1.1 million increase from Springfield Town Center and $2.4 million increase in lease termination revenue, partially offset by $0.7 million of lower revenue from tenants that filed for bankruptcy in 2016. See     Real Estate Revenue    and     Property Operating Expenses    above for further information about the factors affecting NOI from our consolidated properties.  
    
  The table below presents total NOI and total NOI excluding lease terminations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

  Funds From Operations 
    
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) defines Funds From Operations ( FFO ), which is a non-GAAP measure commonly used by REITs, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains and losses on sales of operating properties, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition, or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. NAREIT s established guidance provides that excluding impairment write downs of depreciable real estate is consistent with the NAREIT definition. 
    
  FFO is a commonly used measure of operating performance and profitability among REITs. We use FFO and FFO per diluted share and unit of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership ( OP Unit ) in measuring our performance against our peers and as one of the performance measures for determining incentive compensation amounts earned under certain of our performance-based executive compensation programs. 
    
  FFO does not include gains and losses on sales of operating real estate assets or impairment write downs of depreciable real estate, which are included in the determination of net income in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, FFO is not a comprehensive measure of our operating cash flows. In addition, since FFO does not include depreciation on real estate assets, FFO may not be a useful performance measure when comparing our operating performance to that of other non-real estate commercial enterprises. We compensate for these limitations by using FFO in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures, such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and other non-GAAP financial performance measures, such as NOI. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents     

GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement to FFO. 
    
  We also present Funds From Operations, as adjusted, and Funds From Operations per diluted share and OP Unit, as adjusted, which are non-GAAP measures, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to show the effect of such items as accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties, acquisition costs, provision for employee separation expense, and loss on hedge ineffectiveness, which had a significant effect on our results of operations, but are not, in our opinion, indicative of our operating performance.  
    
  We believe that FFO is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as gains on sales of operating real estate and depreciation and amortization of real estate, among others. We believe that Funds From Operations, as adjusted, is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it adjusts FFO to exclude items that management does not believe are indicative of our operating performance, such as accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties, acquisition costs, provision for employee separation expense, and loss on hedge ineffectiveness. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP to FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders, FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders per diluted share and OP Unit, FFO, as adjusted, attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders and FFO, as adjusted, attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders per diluted share and OP Unit, for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

     Table of Contents     

FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders was   $37.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.1 million  , or   0.3%  , compared to   $37.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is primarily due to the   $2.5 million   decrease in interest expense, a   $3.3 million   increase in Same Store NOI partially offset by a   $4.6 million   decrease in Non Same Store NOI due primarily to property sales in 2015 and 2016 and increases in other expenses including general and administrative, and project and other expenses. 
    
  FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders per diluted share and OP Unit was   $0.49   per share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders was   $102.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $11.1 million  , or   12.1%  , compared to   $91.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is primarily due to a decrease of   $4.4 million   in acquisition costs and other expenses, including $1.8 million of activist defense costs and a decrease of   $7.4 million   of interest expense. 
    
  FFO attributable to common shareholders and OP Unit holders per diluted share and OP Unit   increased   by   $0.11   to   $1.32   per share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.21   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  This  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section contains certain  forward-looking statements  that relate to expectations and projections that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our future liquidity and capital resources, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that might cause our actual liquidity and capital resources to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional factors that might affect our liquidity and capital resources  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents     

include those discussed herein and in the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements about our liquidity and capital resources to reflect new information, future events or otherwise. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions to common and preferred shareholders, recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, but excluding acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects, generally through our available working capital and net cash provided by operations, subject to the terms and conditions of our 2013 Revolving Facility and our 2014 Term Loans and 2015 Term Loan (collectively, the  Credit Agreements ). We believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make any distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The aggregate distributions made to preferred shareholders, common shareholders and OP Unit holders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $60.9 million  , based on distributions of   $1.5498   per Series A Preferred Share,   $1.3827   per Series B Preferred Share and   $0.63   per common share and OP Unit. The following are some of the factors that could affect our cash flows and require the funding of future cash distributions, recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows: 

adverse changes or prolonged downturns in general, local or retail industry economic, financial, credit or capital market or competitive conditions, leading to a reduction in real estate revenue or cash flows or an increase in expenses; 
                
    deterioration in our tenants  business operations and financial stability, including anchor or non anchor tenant bankruptcies, leasing delays or terminations, or lower sales, causing deferrals or declines in rent, percentage rent and cash flows; 
                
    inability to achieve targets for, or decreases in, property occupancy and rental rates, resulting in lower or delayed real estate revenue and operating income; 
                
    increases in operating costs, including increases that cannot be passed on to tenants, resulting in reduced operating income and cash flows; and 
                
    increases in interest rates resulting in higher borrowing costs. 
       
  We expect to meet certain of our longer-term requirements, such as obligations to fund redevelopment and development projects and certain capital requirements (including scheduled debt maturities), future property and portfolio acquisitions, renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through a variety of capital sources, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements. 
  In December 2014, our universal shelf registration statement was filed with the SEC and became effective. We may use the availability under our shelf registration statement to offer and sell common shares of beneficial interest, preferred shares and various types of debt securities, among other types of securities, to the public. 

Credit Agreements 
    
  We have entered into four credit agreements (collectively, as amended, the  Credit Agreements ): (1) the 2013 Revolving Facility, (2) the 2014 7-Year Term Loan, (3) the 2014 5-Year Term Loan, and (4) the 2015 5-Year Term Loan. 
    
  On June 30, 2016, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust ( PREIT ), PREIT Associates, L.P. ( PREIT Associates ) and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. ( PRI  and, collectively with PREIT and PREIT Associates, the  Borrower ) entered into an Amendment (the  Amendment ) to the 2014 7-Year Term Loan. The Amendment increased potential borrowing under the 2014 7-Year Term Loan from $100.0 million to $250.0 million, and expanded the accordion feature of the 2014 7-Year Term Loan from up to $200.0 million to up to $400.0 million. Among other things, the Amendment lowered the interest rates in the applicable pricing grid and extended the termination date from January 7, 2021 to December 29, 2021. Pursuant to the Amendment, amounts borrowed under the 2014 7-Year Term Loan bear interest at a rate between 1.35% and 1.90% per annum, depending on PREIT s leverage, in excess of LIBOR, which is a reduction from the former range of 1.80% to 2.35%. At September 30, 2016, the rate in effect was 1.60% per annum in excess of LIBOR. 
    
  See note 4 in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of the identical covenants and common provisions contained in the Credit Agreements. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents     

As of September 30, 2016  , we had borrowed $400.0 million under the Term Loans, and   $115.0 million   was outstanding under our 2013 Revolving Facility,   $7.4 million   was pledged as collateral for letters of credit, and, pursuant to certain covenants in the 2013 Revolving Facility, the unused portion of the 2013 Revolving Facility that was available to us was   $201.6 million  .  

Interest Rate Derivative Agreements 
    
  As of September 30, 2016  , we had entered into   26   interest rate swap agreements with a weighted average base interest rate of   1.25%   on a notional amount of   $627.7 million  ,   maturing on various dates through   March 2021   and   one   forward starting interest rate swap agreement with an interest rate of   1.42%   on a notional amount of   $48.0 million  , which will be effective starting January 2018 and will mature in February 2021. 
    
  We entered into these interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the interest payments associated with our issuances of variable interest rate long term debt. We have assessed the effectiveness of these interest rate swap agreements as hedges at inception and on a quarterly basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , except as set forth below, we considered these interest rate swap agreements to be highly effective as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swap agreements are net settled monthly.    
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016   includes a net loss of   $1.7 million   relating to forward starting swaps that we cash settled in prior years that are being amortized over   10   year periods commencing on the closing dates of the debt instruments that are associated with these settled swaps. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which excludes accrued interest but includes any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements, was   $6.4 million  . If we had breached any of the default provisions in these agreements as of   September 30, 2016  , we might have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value (including accrued interest) of   $7.0 million  . We had not breached any of these provisions as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Mortgage Loan Activity 
    
  In April 2016, we entered into a   $130.0 million   mortgage loan secured by Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The new mortgage loan bears interest at the rate of   2.00%   plus LIBOR and has a maturity date of April 2021. The proceeds from the new mortgage loan were used to pay down a portion of the Credit Facility borrowings that were used to repay the previous   $141.2 million   mortgage loan. 
    
  In March 2016, we borrowed an additional   $9.0 million  , lowered the interest rate to   2.35%   plus LIBOR and extended the maturity date to March 2021 on the mortgage loan secured by Viewmont Mall in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $79.3 million   mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by Valley Mall in Hagerstown, Maryland using   $50.0 million   from our 2013 Revolving Facility and the balance from available working capital. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $32.8 million   mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by Lycoming Mall in Pennsdale, Pennsylvania in connection with the March 2016 sale of the property using proceeds from the sale and available working capital. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid a   $28.1 million   mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia in connection with the March 2016 sale of the property using proceeds from the sale. 
    
  Mortgage Loans 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our mortgage loans, which are secured by   12   of our consolidated properties, are due in installments over various terms extending to   October 2025  .   Nine   of these mortgage loans bear interest at fixed interest rates that range from   3.88%   to   5.95%   and had a weighted average interest rate of   4.46%   at   September 30, 2016  .   Three   of our mortgage loans bear interest at variable rates and had a weighted average interest rate of   2.76%   at   September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate of all consolidated mortgage loans was   4.11%   at   September 30, 2016  . Mortgage loans for properties owned by unconsolidated partnerships are accounted for in  Investments in partnerships, at equity  and  Distributions in excess of partnership investments  on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the table below.

The following table outlines the timing of principal payments related to our consolidated mortgage loans as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table presents our aggregate contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   for the periods presented: 

_________________________ 
   (1)   Includes payments expected to be made in connection with interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swap agreements. 
   (2)   The timing of the payments of these amounts is uncertain. We expect that the majority of such payments will be made prior to December 31, 2016, but cannot provide any assurance that changed circumstances at these projects will not delay the settlement of these obligations. In addition, our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, has jointly and severally guaranteed 
  the obligations of the joint venture we formed with Macerich to develop the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia to commence and 
  complete a comprehensive redevelopment of that property costing not less than $300.0 million within 48 months after 
  commencement of construction. 
    
  Preferred Share Dividends 
    
  Annual dividends on our 4,600,000 8.25% Series A Preferred Shares ($25.00 liquidation preference) and our 3,450,000 7.375% Series B Preferred Shares ($25.00 liquidation preference) are expected to be $9.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. 

CASH FLOWS 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities totaled   $104.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $91.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in 2016 is primarily due to a decrease of   $7.3 million   in interest expense, a decrease in property operating expenses of   $10.0 million  , an increase in equity in income of partnerships of   $6.2 million  , a decrease in acquisition costs and other expenses of   $4.3 million  , primarily related to the acquisition of Springfield Town Center, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of   $14.0 million   and an increase in provision for employee separation expense of   $1.2 million  .  
    
  Cash flows   provided by   investing activities were   $67.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash flows   used in   investing activities of   $356.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cash flows   provided by   investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $154.8 million   in proceeds from the sale of seven operating properties and two outparcels, investment in construction in progress of   $48.3 million   and real estate improvements of   $32.8 million  , primarily related to ongoing improvements at our properties. Investing activities for the first   nine   months of 2015 included   $320.0 million   used in acquiring Springfield Town Center in Springfield, Virginia in 2015,

investment in construction in progress of   $21.7 million   and real estate improvements of   $33.9 million  , primarily related to ongoing improvements at our properties.  
    
  Cash flows   used in   financing activities were   $169.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash flows   provided by   financing activities of   $246.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cash flows   used in   financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   included mortgage loan repayments of   $280.3 million  , dividends and distributions of   $60.9 million  , and principal installments on mortgage loans of   $12.7 million  , partially offset by   $50.0 million   of 2013 Revolving Facility borrowings, borrowing of   $130.0 million   from the mortgage loan secured by Woodland Mall and additional borrowing of   $9.0 million   from the mortgage loan secured by Viewmont Mall.  Cash flows   provided by   financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included   $210.0 million   of 2013 Revolving Facility borrowings,   $120.0 million   in Term Loan borrowing, a $170.0 million mortgage loan secured by Willow Grove Park, a $96.2 million mortgage loan secured by Patrick Henry Mall and $5.8 million of additional borrowing from the mortgage loan secured by Francis Scott Key Mall, partially offset by cash flows used by financing activities of $133.6 million used to repay the prior mortgage loan secured by Willow Grove Park, $83.8 million to repay the prior mortgage loan secured by Patrick Henry Mall, $55.3 million used to repay the mortgage loan secured by Magnolia Mall, dividends and distributions of   $59.4 million  , and principal installment payments of   $14.9 million  .  

ENVIRONMENTAL 
    
  We are aware of certain environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, performed remediation of such environmental matters, and we are not aware of any significant remaining potential liability relating to these environmental matters or of any obligation to satisfy requirements for further remediation. We may be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters. We have insurance coverage for certain environmental claims up to $25.0 million per occurrence and up to $25.0 million in the aggregate. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  
    
  COMPETITION AND TENANT CREDIT RISK 
    
  Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and in-line stores and other tenants. We also compete to acquire land for new site development or to acquire parcels or properties to add to our existing properties. Our malls and our other retail properties face competition from similar retail centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. We also face competition from a variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail channels or formats as well, including internet retailers. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive.  
    
  The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, lead us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make and might affect occupancy and net operating income of such properties. 
  Any such capital improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of malls, other retail properties and prime development sites or sites adjacent to our properties, including institutional pension funds, other REITs and other owner-operators of retail properties. When we seek to make acquisitions, competitors might drive up the price we must pay for properties, parcels, other assets or other companies or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties, parcels, assets or companies. In addition, our potential acquisition targets might find our competitors to be more attractive suitors if they have greater resources, are willing to pay more, or have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular,  larger REITs might enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, a better ability to raise capital, a better ability to finance an acquisition, better cash flow and enhanced operating efficiencies. We might not succeed in acquiring retail properties or development sites that we seek, or, if we pay a higher price for a property or site, or generate lower cash flow from an acquired property or site than we expect, our investment returns will be reduced, which will adversely affect the value of our securities. 
  
   39 

     Table of Contents     

We receive a substantial portion of our operating income as rent under leases with tenants. At any time, any tenant having space in one or more of our properties could experience a downturn in its business that might weaken its financial condition, as was the case for a few of our tenants in recent periods. There are also a number of tenants that are based outside the U.S., and these tenants are affected by economic conditions in the country where their headquarters are located and internationally. Any of such tenants might enter into or renew leases with relatively shorter terms. Such tenants might also defer or fail to make rental payments when due, delay or defer lease commencement, voluntarily vacate the premises or declare bankruptcy, which could result in the termination of the tenant s lease, or preclude the collection of rent in connection with the space for a period of time, and could result in material losses to us and harm to our results of operations. Also, it might take time to terminate leases of underperforming or nonperforming tenants, and we might incur costs to remove such tenants. Some of our tenants occupy stores at multiple locations in our portfolio, and so the effect of any bankruptcy or store closing of those tenants might be more significant to us than the bankruptcy or store closings of other tenants. In addition, under many of our leases, our tenants pay rent based, in whole or in part, on a percentage of their sales. Accordingly, declines in these tenants  sales directly affect our results of operations. Also, if tenants are unable to comply with the terms of our leases, or otherwise seek changes to the terms, including changes to the amount of rent, we might modify lease terms in ways that are less favorable to us. 
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  There is seasonality in the retail real estate industry. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of all or a portion of rent based on a percentage of a tenant s sales revenue, or sales revenue over certain levels. Income from such rent is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met. The sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter, during the December holiday season. Also, many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and a higher number of tenants vacate their space early in the year. As a result, our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first and second quarters. Our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter. 
    
  INFLATION 
    
  Inflation can have many effects on financial performance. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of rent based on a percentage of sales, which might increase with inflation. Leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses, which might reduce the impact of such increases on us. However, rent increases might not keep up with inflation, or if we recover a smaller proportion of property operating expenses, we might bear more costs if such expenses increase because of inflation. 
    
  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by us, contain certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans, strategies, anticipated events, trends and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, achievements or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that might cause future events, achievements or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In particular, our business might be materially and adversely affected by uncertainties affecting real estate businesses generally as well as the following, among other factors: 

changes in the retail industry, including consolidation and store closings, particularly among anchor tenants; 
                
    our ability to maintain and increase property occupancy, sales and rental rates, in light of the relatively high number of leases that have expired or are expiring in the next two years; 
                
    increases in operating costs that cannot be passed on to tenants; 
                
    current economic conditions and the state of employment growth and consumer confidence and spending, and the corresponding effects on tenant business performance, prospects, solvency and leasing decisions and on our cash flows, and the value and potential impairment of our properties; 
                
    our ability to sell properties that we seek to dispose of or our ability to obtain estimated sale prices; 
                
    potential losses on impairment of certain long-lived assets, such as real estate, or of intangible assets, such as goodwill, including such losses that we might be required to record in connection with any dispositions of assets; 
                
    risks relating to development and redevelopment activities;

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
    
  The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated debt portfolio consisted primarily of   $1,227.7 million   of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans,   $115.0 million   borrowed under our 2013 Revolving Facility which bore interest at a rate of   1.82%  ,   $150.0 million   borrowed under our 2014 5-Year Term Loan which bore interest at a rate of   2.12%  ,   $150.0 million   borrowed under our 2015 5-Year Term Loan which bore interest at a rate of   2.12%   and   $100.0 million   borrowed under our 2014 7-Year Term Loan which bore interest at a rate of   2.12%  . 
    
  Our mortgage loans, which are secured by   12   of our consolidated properties, are due in installments over various terms extending to   October 2025  .   Nine   of these mortgage loans bear interest at fixed interest rates that range from   3.88%   to   5.95%   and had a weighted average interest rate of   4.46%   at   September 30, 2016  .   Three   of our mortgage loans bear interest at variable rates and had a weighted average interest rate of   2.76%   at   September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate of all consolidated mortgage loans was   4.11%   at   September 30, 2016  . Mortgage loans for properties owned by unconsolidated partnerships are accounted for in  Investments in partnerships, at equity  and  Distributions in excess of partnership investments  on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the table below. 
    
  Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts of the expected annual maturities due in the respective years and the weighted average interest rates for the principal payments in the specified periods: 

_________________________ 
        
  As of September 30, 2016  , we had   $769.8 million   of variable rate debt. Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered into   26   interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate weighted average interest rate of   1.25%   on a notional amount of   $627.7 million   maturing on various dates through March 2021 and   one   forward starting interest rate swap agreement with an interest rate of   1.42%   on a notional amount of   $48.0 million  , which will be effective starting January 2018 and maturing in February 2021.  
    
  Changes in market interest rates have different effects on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in market interest rates applicable to the fixed portion of the debt portfolio affects the fair value, but it has no effect on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in market interest rates applicable to the variable portion of the debt portfolio affects the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not affect the fair value. The following sensitivity analysis related to our debt portfolio, which includes the effects of our interest rate swap agreements, assumes an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates from their actual   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. 
    
  A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in our net financial instrument position of   $62.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an increase in our net financial instrument position of   $64.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an additional   $1.4 million   in interest expense annually. A 100 basis point decrease would have reduced interest incurred by   $1.4 million   annually.

     Table of Contents     

To manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost, we may employ interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps and floors, or a combination thereof, depending on the underlying exposure. Interest rate differentials that arise under swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts. If interest rates rise, the resulting cost of funds is expected to be lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly. Conversely, if interest rates fall, the resulting costs would be expected to be, and in some cases have been, higher. We may also employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions. Gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the underlying transaction occurs, expires or is otherwise terminated. See note 7 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Because the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016  , it does not consider changes, exposures or positions which have arisen or could arise after that date. The information presented herein has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss or expense with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  We are committed to providing accurate and timely disclosure in satisfaction of our SEC reporting obligations. In 2002, we established a Disclosure Committee to formalize our disclosure controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , and have concluded as follows: 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
                
    Our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information that we are required to disclose in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
       
  There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
    
  In the normal course of business, we have become and might in the future become involved in legal actions relating to the ownership and operation of our properties and the properties that we manage for third parties. In management s opinion, the resolution of any such pending legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
