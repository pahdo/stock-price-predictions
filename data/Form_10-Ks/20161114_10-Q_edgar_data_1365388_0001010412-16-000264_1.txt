FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS        In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to  Gulf,  the  Company,   we,   us,   our  and words of similar import refer to Gulf   Orient Steamship Company, Ltd., unless the context requires otherwise.       This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words:  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   ongoing,   plan,   potential,   predict,   project,   should,   will,   would,  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report. These factors include, among others:           our ability to raise capital;       our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets;       our ability to successfully execute acquisitions on favorable terms;       declines in general economic conditions in the markets where we may compete;       unknown environmental liabilities associated with any companies we may acquire; and       significant competition in the markets where we may operate.       You should read any other cautionary statements made in this Quarterly Report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Quarterly Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly Report completely. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.            2                  JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT DISCLOSURE    We qualify as an  emerging growth company,  as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), as amended by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the  JOBS Act ). An issuer qualifies as an  emerging growth company  if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year, and will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:                                    the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more;                                       the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement;                                        the date on which the issuer has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or                                       the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a  large accelerated filer,  as defined in Section 240.12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).          As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from various reporting requirements. Specifically, we are exempt from the following provisions:                                    Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires evaluations and reporting related to an issuer s internal controls;                                       Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of the compensation of its executives not less frequently than once every three years; and                                       Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of its so-called  golden parachute  compensation, or compensation upon termination of an employee s employment.          Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with these new or revised accounting standards. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective dates. If we were to elect to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.                3              PART I           Item 1.  Financial Statements         The Financial Statements of the Registrant required to be filed with this 10-Q Quarterly Report were prepared by management and commence below, together with related notes. In the opinion of management, the Financial Statements fairly present the financial condition of the Registrant and include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Registrant s Financial Statements. The results from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2015, Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Registrant s Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 4, 2016.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016 and 2015         NOTE 1:     SUMMARY OF HISTORY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         Nature of Operations        The Company was incorporated in the State of Colorado on May 9, 1996. The Company originally intended to engage in the business of marine transportation. These plans did not materialize, and the Company is currently considering alternative business opportunities.        Income Taxes        The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC Topic 740,   Accounting for Income Taxes.   Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.         Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.        Revenue Recognition        The Company plans to recognize revenue when the following four conditions are present: (1) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (2) the price is fixed or determinable, (3) delivery has occurred or services are rendered, and (4) collection is reasonably assured.        Income (Loss) Per Common Share        Income (Loss) per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as convertible preferred stock, options, or warrants, outstanding during the periods presented. Accordingly, basic and dilutive loss per common share are the same.        Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        The Company has reviewed recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments        It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of related party loans because there is no established market for these loans and it is inappropriate to estimate future cash flows, which are largely dependent on the Company establishing or acquiring operations at some future point. No financial instruments are held for trading purposes.        9              GULF   ORIENT STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LTD.         NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016 and 2015         NOTE 2:     INCOME TAXES        At September 30, 2016, the Company had a net operating loss carryover of approximately $305,000 which expires from 2017 to 2035.       However, due to the fact that the Company has had a change in control, the loss will most likely never be utilized.       At September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset in the amount of $148,811. The amount has been reserved 100% due to the Company s history of losses.       The increase in the valuation allowance was $12,530 and $16,247 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       Components of income tax are as follows:             A reconciliation of the provision for income tax expense with the expected income tax computed by applying the federal statutory income tax to income before provision for income taxes is as follows:             The Company complies with the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1, the Company recognized approximately no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has no tax position at September 30, 2016 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at September 30, 2016. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of its limited activities. Tax years 2013 through 2015 are open to examination by the tax authorities.        NOTE 3: COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS        Management of the Company has conducted a diligent search and concluded that there were no commitments, contingencies, or legal matters pending at the balance sheet dates that have not been disclosed.        10              GULF   ORIENT STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LTD.         NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016 and 2015         NOTE 4: NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTIES        At September 30, 2016, the Company owed $243,126 to related parties for money advanced to the Company or expenses paid on behalf of the Company; $2,500 is non-interest bearing, $2,600 bears annual interest at 24%, $9,286 bears interest at 6%, $3,500 bears annual interest at 7%, $140,681 bears annual interest at 9%, $2,800 bears annual interest at 10%, and $1,000 bears annual interest at 18%. The Company received proceeds from these related parties of $11,000 and $30,012 during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and did not make any repayments during those periods. The notes are all due on demand. Total principal and accrued interest at September 30, 2016, was $162,367 and $80,759, respectively, resulting in the total payable balance of $243,126. During 2014, the Company and the President agreed to accrue $3,000 of interest on previous non-interest bearing obligations of about $29,235 and began charging 9% interest on such obligations, effective January 1, 2015.       During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company converted two notes into its common stock. One note for $5,000 was due on October 13, 2005 and accrued a total interest of $2,500 on that date. This note was converted to common stock at $.07 per share for 71,429 shares. The $2,500 interest on the note is still outstanding and is included in the note payable balance at September 30, 2016.        A second note for $2,500 was converted to common stock during the year ended December 31, 2007 at $.07 per share for 35,714 shares. Accrued interest on the note was not converted and is included in the note payable balance at September 30, 2016.        NOTE 5: GOING CONCERN        The Company s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a retained deficit of $386,535 and a working capital deficit of $374,754.       The Company s continued existence is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and to invest in future operations. Management is actively pursuing possible business opportunities. The Company will look to related parties to fund continuing operations until a suitable business opportunity is identified.        NOTE 6: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        The Company has evaluated events from September 30, 2016, through the date whereupon the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no additional items to disclose.            11              Item 2.    Management s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          Forward-looking Statements        Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words  may,   would,   could,   should,   expects,   projects,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   plans,   intends,   targets  or similar expressions.       Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following, general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters.       Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.  We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        Plan of Operation        Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected.        During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing; the payment of our Securities and Exchange Commission and Exchange Act reporting filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization.  We anticipate that these funds will be provided to us in the form of loans from Michael Vardakis, our current President.  There are no written agreements requiring Mr. Vardakis to provide these cash resources; and to the extent funds are provided, such funds will bear interest and will be due on demand.  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have not actively begun to seek any business or acquisition candidate.          Results of Operations        We have generated no revenues since inception.  We had net losses of ($10,591) and ($12,180) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  And we had net losses of ($32,127) and ($41,658) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  Primarily all of these losses are the result of legal and accounting expenses.        Liquidity        We had $79 cash as of September 30, 2016.       During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to the payment of our Securities and Exchange Commission and Exchange Act reporting filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization.  We do not have any cash reserves to pay for our administrative expenses for the next 12 months.  In the event that additional funding is required in order to keep us in good standing, we may attempt to raise such funding through loans or through additional sales of our common stock.               12              Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         Not required.        Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures         Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.        Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.         Changes in internal control over financial reporting         Our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
