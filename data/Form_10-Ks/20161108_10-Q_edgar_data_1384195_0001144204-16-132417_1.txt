Forward-Looking Statements    

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27H of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking
statements that represent management s beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. Forward-looking
statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, need for financing,
competitive position, and potential growth opportunities. Our forward-looking statements do not consider the effects of future
legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words  believes,   intends,   may,   should, 
 anticipates,   expects,   could,   plans,   estimates,   projects, 
 targets,  or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy or trends. Although we believe that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to
be correct. Such statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results, and
actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements. 

Among the factors that could cause actual
future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report and in our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. While it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties
including, but not limited to: 

declines or volatility in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas;

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowings or other sources to enable us to fully develop and
produce our oil and natural gas properties;   

general economic conditions, whether internationally, nationally or in the regional and local market areas in which we do business;   

risks associated with drilling, including completion risks, cost overruns and the drilling of non-economic wells or dry holes;   

uncertainties associated with estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves;   

the presence or recoverability of estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the actual future production rates and associated
costs;   

risks and liabilities associated with acquired companies and properties;   

risks related to integration of acquired companies and properties;   

potential defects in title to our properties;   

cost and availability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services;

our ability to secure firm transportation for oil and natural gas we produce and to sell the oil and natural gas at market
prices;   

exploration and development risks;   

management s ability to execute our plans to meet our goals;   

our ability to retain key members of our management team;   

weather conditions;   

actions or inactions of third-party operators of our properties;   

costs and liabilities associated with environmental, health and safety laws;   

our ability to find and retain highly skilled personnel;   

operating hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business;   

competition in the oil and natural gas industry; and   

the other factors discussed under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015.   

Should our underlying assumptions prove
incorrect or the consequences of the aforementioned risks worsen, actual results could differ materially from those expected. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as
to the date hereof. All such forward-looking statements and any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the statements contained herein or referred
to in this section and any other cautionary statements that may accompany such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise. 

There may also be other risks and uncertainties
that we are unable to predict at this time or that we do not now expect to have a material adverse impact on our business. 

PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 1. Financial Statements. 

The unaudited condensed financial statements
included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and related footnotes
included in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Condensed Financial Statements  
  The accompanying condensed financial statements prepared by Ring Energy, Inc. (the  Company  or  Ring )
have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. In the opinion of the Company s management, the
accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the results of operations
for the periods presented, which adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, except as disclosed herein. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year ending December 31, 2016. 

Certain notes and other disclosures have
been omitted from these interim financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Organization and Nature of Operations
    The Company is a Nevada corporation that owns interests in oil and natural gas properties located in Texas and
Kansas. The Company s oil and natural gas sales, profitability and future growth are dependent upon prevailing and future
prices for oil and natural gas and the successful acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties. Oil
and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial decline
in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations,
cash flows and quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced. 

Use of Estimates    
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Changes in the future estimated oil and natural gas reserves or the estimated future cash flows
attributable to the reserves that are utilized for impairment analysis could have a significant impact on the Company s future
results of operations. 

Fair Measurements    
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has established a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy consists of three
broad levels. Level 1 inputs are the highest priority and consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities. Level 2 are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly. Level 3 are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments  
  The carrying amounts reported for the revolving line of credit approximates fair value because the underlying instruments
are at interest rates which approximate current market rates. The carrying amounts of receivables and accounts payable and other
current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturities and/or liquid nature of these assets
and liabilities. 

Concentration of Credit Risk and
Major Customer     The Company had cash in excess of federally insured limits at September 30, 2016. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, sales to two customers represented 48% and 43%, respectively, of the Company s oil and gas
revenues. At September 30, 2016, these customers made up 43% and 43%, respectively, of the Company s accounts receivable. 

Approximately 83% of the Company s
accounts and joint interest receivables are from purchasers of oil and gas. Oil and gas sales are generally unsecured. The Company
has not had any significant credit losses in the past and believes its accounts receivable are fully collectable. Accordingly,
no allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided at September 30, 2016. The Company also has a joint interest billing receivable.
Joint interest billing receivables are collateralized by the pro rata revenue attributable to the joint interest holders and further
by the interest itself. 

RING ENERGY, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

Oil and Gas Properties    
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs associated with the
acquisition, leasing, exploration, and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Costs capitalized include acquisition
costs, estimated future costs of abandonment and site restoration, geological and geophysical expenditures, lease rentals on undeveloped
properties and costs of drilling and equipping productive and non-productive wells. Drilling costs include directly related overhead
costs. Capitalized costs are generally categorized either as being subject to amortization or not subject to amortization. All
of our costs are subject to amortization. 

All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties,
plus estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved
reserves as determined by independent engineers. The Company evaluates oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually.
Amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $2,568,153 and $8,541,981, respectively, based
on depletion at the rate of $11.72 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to $4,668,353 and $11,527,684, respectively, for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, based on depletion at the rate of $21.33 per barrel of oil equivalent. These amounts
include $71,666 and $229,422, respectively, of depreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$79,797 and $208,440, respectively, of depreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Write-down of Oil and Gas Properties
    Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities
are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by
SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10. The ceiling test is performed quarterly utilizing the average of prices in effect on the first day
of the month for the preceding twelve month period in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8995. The ceiling limits such pooled
costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted
at 10%, plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties, less any associated tax effects. If such capitalized costs
exceed the ceiling, the Company will record a write-down to the extent of such excess as a non-cash charge to earnings. Any such
write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and results in a lower depletion, depreciation and amortization ( DD A )
rate in future periods. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently
increase the ceiling. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of the Company s proved oil and gas properties
as a result of ceiling test limitations of $9,648,942 and $56,513,016, respectively, which is reflected as ceiling test impairment
in the accompanying Statements of Operations. The Company did not have any write-downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Office Equipment    
Office equipment is valued at historical cost adjusted for impairment loss less accumulated depreciation. Historical costs include
all direct costs associated with the acquisition of office equipment and placing such equipment in service. Depreciation is calculated
using the straight-line method based upon an estimated useful life of 5 to 7 years. 

Asset Retirement Obligation  
  The Company records a liability in the period in which an asset retirement obligation ( ARO ) is incurred,
in an amount equal to the discounted estimated fair value of the obligation that is capitalized. Thereafter, this liability is
accreted up to the final estimated retirement cost. An ARO is a future expenditure related to the disposal or other retirement
of certain assets. The Company s ARO relates to future plugging and abandonment expenses of its oil and natural gas properties
and related facilities disposal. 

Revenue Recognition    
The Company predominantly derives its revenues from the sale of produced oil and natural gas. Revenue is recorded in the month
the product is delivered to the purchasers. At the end of each month, the Company recognizes oil and natural gas sales based on
estimates of the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price to be received. Variances between the Company s
estimated oil and natural gas sales and actual receipts are recorded in the month the payments are received.

Share-Based Employee Compensation  
  The Company has outstanding stock option grants to directors, officers and employees, which are described more fully in
Note 6. The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the related compensation expense over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally the vesting period. 

Share-Based Compensation to Non-Employees  
  The Company accounts for share-based compensation issued to non-employees as either the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  The measurement date
for these issuances is the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the recipient to earn the equity instruments
is reached or (ii) the date at which the recipient s performance is complete. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for improvements to employee share-based payment accounting to simplify the accounting
for share-based compensation. The new standard requires all excess tax benefits and reductions from differences between the deduction
for tax purposes and the compensation cost recorded for financial reporting purposes be recognized as income tax expense or benefit
in the Statement of Operations and not recognized as additional paid-in capital. The new standard also requires all excess tax
benefits and deficiencies to be classified as operating activity included with income tax cash flows. For public business entities,
the amendments are effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 841). For lessees, the amendments in this update require that for all leases not considered to be short term, a company
recognize both a lease liability and right-of-use asset on its balance sheet, representing the obligation to make payments and
the right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. Management is currently evaluating the
impact that this amendment will have on its financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance
regarding several broad topics related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance
on our financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance
regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance applies prospectively
to all entities, requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose certain information when substantial doubt
exists. We will adopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2016. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding
the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. In April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance, addressed
implementation issues and provided technical corrections. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective
approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit). The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 

Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss)
per Share     Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if all contracts to issue common stock were converted into common stock, except for those that are anti-dilutive. The dilutive
effect of stock options and other share-based compensation is calculated using the treasury method.

NOTE 2   EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
INFORMATION  

Stock options to purchase 2,780,600 shares
of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock options to purchase 2,623,250 shares of common stock were excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as
their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 3   REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  

On July 1, 2014, the Company entered into
a Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as lender, issuing bank and administrative agent for several banks and other financial institutions
and lenders ( Administrative Agent ), which was amended on May 18, 2016, June 26, 2015 and July 24, 2014 (as amended,
the  Credit Facility ).  The Credit Facility provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum
borrowing amount of $500 million. The Credit Facility matures on June 26, 2020, and is secured by substantially all of the Company s
assets. 

In May 2016, the borrowing base (the  Borrowing
Base ) was reduced from the initial $100 million to $60 million. The Borrowing Base is subject to periodic redeterminations,
mandatory reductions and further adjustments from time to time. The Borrowing Base will be redetermined semi-annually on
each May 1 and November 1, beginning November 1, 2015. The Borrowing Base will also be reduced in certain circumstances such
as the sale or disposition of certain oil and gas properties of the Company or its subsidiaries and cancellation of certain hedging
positions. 

The Credit Facility allows for Eurodollar
Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Credit Facility).  The interest rate on each Eurodollar Loan will be the
adjusted LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus a margin between 1.75% and 2.75% (depending on the then-current level of
borrowing base usage).  The annual interest rate on each Base Rate Loan is (a) the greatest of (i) the Administrative Agent s
prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% per annum or the (iii) adjusted LIBOR determined on a daily basis for
an interest period of one-month, plus 1.00% per annum, plus (b) a margin between 2.75% and 3.75% (depending on the then-current
level of borrowing base usage).   

The Credit Facility contains certain covenants,
which, among other things, require the maintenance of (i) a total leverage ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a
minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events
of default. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Facility, and no
amounts were outstanding on the Credit Facility.

NOTE 4   ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION  

The Company provides for the obligation
to plug and abandon oil and gas wells at the dates properties are either acquired or the wells are drilled. The asset retirement
obligation is adjusted each quarter for any liabilities incurred or settled during the period, accretion expense and any revisions
made to the estimated cash flows. The asset retirement obligation incurred at the time of drilling was computed using the annual
credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate at the applicable dates. Changes in the asset retirement obligation were as follows: 

NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

On April 26, 2016, the Company closed
an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock, including 1,500,000 shares sold pursuant to the full
exercise of an over-allotment option previously granted by the underwriters, pursuant to an effective registration statement on
Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-200324), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3,
2014.  The shares were sold at the public offering price of $5.60 per share.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and Seaport
Global Securities LLC acted as joint book-running managers. The gross proceeds from the offering were $64,400,000, and the Company s
net proceeds from the offering were $61,063,497, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses payable by the
Company of $3,336,503.  These offering costs and expenses included $3,200,000 in underwriting discounts with the remainder
of the offering expenses being various legal, accounting, travel and other costs.  No amounts were paid, directly or indirectly,
to any director, officer or 10% owner.  Out of the proceeds of the offering, the Company paid all principal of $50.9 million
and related interest of approximately $215,000 outstanding under its Credit Facility and used approximately $10 million for leasing
activities, development of existing properties and working capital.

NOTE 6   EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS  

Compensation expense charged against income
for share-based awards during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $555,587 and $1,647,554, respectively, as
compared to $650,968 and $1,962,142, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These amounts are included
in general and administrative expense in the accompanying financial statements. 

In 2011, the Board of Directors and stockholders
approved and adopted a long-term incentive plan which allowed for the issuance of up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock through
the grant of qualified stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock. In 2013, the Company s stockholders
approved an amendment to the long-term incentive plan, increasing the number of shares eligible under the plan to 5,000,000 shares.
As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,949,650 shares remaining eligible for issuance under the plan. 

On January 13, 2016, upon the recommendation
of the Compensation Committee, Ring rescinded the option awards granted to its employees and directors on December 9, 2015 (other
than Messrs. McCabe and Rochford, who are the members of the Compensation Committee) as the result of a significant decline in
the stock price and re-issued the option awards as of that date to meet the goals and objectives of the Company s equity
based compensation program. 

The fair value of each option award is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and using certain assumptions. The expected volatility
is based on the historical price volatility of the Company s common stock. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating
the expected term for options granted. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the midpoint between the vesting
period and the contractual term of the stock option. The risk-free interest rate represents the U.S. Treasury bill rate for the
expected life of the related stock options. The dividend yield represents the Company s anticipated cash dividend over the
expected life of the stock options. The following are the assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of operations.
This section should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our interim
unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes to these financial statements.  

Results of Operations   For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Oil and natural gas sales.  For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, oil and natural gas sales revenue decreased $806,464 to $7,822,543, compared to $8,629,007
for the same period during 2015. Oil sales decreased $1,059,671 and natural gas sales increased $253,206. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, oil sales volume decreased 6,362 barrels to 174,707 barrels, compared to 181,069 barrels for the same
period in 2015. The average realized per barrel oil price decreased 10% from $45.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
to $40.83 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, gas sales volume increased
63,514 thousand cubic feet (MCF) to 229,456 MCF, compared to 165,942 MCF for the same period in 2015. The average realized natural
gas price per MCF increased 14% from $2.63 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $3.01 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

Oil and gas production costs.   Our
lease operating expenses (LOE) decreased from $2,917,296 or $13.98 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, to $2,329,228 or $10.94 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Production taxes.  Production taxes
as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 5% during the three months ended September 30, 2015, and remained steady at 5%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. These rates are expected to stay relatively steady unless we make acquisitions in
other states with differing production tax rates or the state of Texas or Kansas changes its production tax rates. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.
  Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased by $2,100,200 to $2,568,153 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $4,668,353 during the same period in 2015. The decrease was the result of a lower depletion rate per BOE,
as a result of the addition of additional reserves through our development activity and a reduction in our Oil and natural gas
properties subject to amortization as a result of the Ceiling test impairments we have incurred. 

Ceiling Test Write-Down.     The
Company recorded a $9,648,942 non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is reflected as ceiling test impairments in
the accompanying Statements of Operations. The ceiling test write down was the result of lower commodity prices and their negative
impact on the company s estimated proved reserves and estimated net cash flows. The ceiling test was calculated based upon
the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period at September 30,
2016, adjusted for market differentials, per SEC guidelines. The write-down reduced earnings in the period and will result in a
lower depreciation, depletion and amortization rate in future periods. The Company did not have any write-downs related to the
full cost ceiling limitation during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

General and administrative expenses.
 General and administrative expenses decreased $120,059 to $1,882,579 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $2,002,638 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Compensation related expenses, both cash based and stock based, make
up the majority of our general and administrative expense. A reduction in the stock based compensation between periods was the
primary reason for the decrease. 

Net loss.   For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we showed a net loss of $5,944,137, as compared to a net loss of $1,138,268 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The primary reason for this change was the ceiling test write down. 

Results of Operations   For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Oil and natural gas sales.  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, oil and natural gas sales revenue decreased $2,631,958 to $21,019,540, compared to $23,561,498
for the same period during 2015. Oil sales decreased $3,542,827 and natural gas sales increased $910,869. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, oil sales volume increased 43,092 barrels to 527,010 barrels, compared to 483,918 barrels for the same period
in 2015. The average realized per barrel oil price decreased 22% from $47.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $36.72
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gas sales volume increased 407,889
thousand cubic feet (MCF) to 688,196 MCF, compared to 280,307 MCF for the same period in 2015. The average realized natural gas
price per MCF decreased 10% from $2.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.42 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

Oil and gas production costs.   Our
lease operating expenses (LOE) increased from $6,991,148 or $13.18 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $7,019,771 or $10.94 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In total, lease operating expenses
increased as a result of the acquisition of properties in Culberson and Reeves County, Texas completed in June 2015. On a per BOE
basis, lease operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of increased production between periods. 

Production taxes.  Production taxes
as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and remained steady at 5%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These rates are expected to stay relatively steady unless we make acquisitions in
other states with differing production tax rates or the state of Texas or Kansas changes its production tax rates. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization.
  Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased by $2,985,703 to $8,541,981 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $11,527,684 during the same period in 2015. The decrease was the result of a lower depletion rate per BOE,
as a result of the addition of additional reserves through our development activity and a reduction in our Oil and natural gas
properties subject to amortization as a result of the Ceiling test impairments we have incurred. 

Ceiling Test Write-Down.     The
Company recorded a $56,513,016 non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is reflected as ceiling test impairments in
the accompanying Statements of Operations. The ceiling test write down was the result of lower commodity prices and their negative
impact on the company s estimated proved reserves and estimated net cash flows. The ceiling test was calculated based upon
the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period at September 30,
2016, adjusted for market differentials, per SEC guidelines. The write-down reduced earnings in the period and will result in a
lower depreciation, depletion and amortization rate in future periods. The Company did not have any write-downs related to the
full cost ceiling limitation during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

General and administrative expenses.
 General and administrative expenses increased by $247,683 to $6,023,038 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $5,775,355 during the same period in 2015. Compensation related expenses, both cash based and stock based, make up the majority
of our general and administrative expense. 

Net loss.   For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, there was a net loss of $37,160,681, as compared to a net loss of $1,579,725 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The primary reasons for this change were the ceiling test write down and lower received oil and gas prices. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity   

As shown in the financial statements for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $2,249,007, compared to $4,431,350 as of December 31,
2015. The Company had net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of $4,903,091, compared
to cash used in operating activities of $2,584,636 for the same period of 2015. The other most significant cash outflows during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were capital expenditures of $22,362,605 and $99,158,490, respectively, and payment
of our outstanding debt balance of $50,900,000 in 2016. The most significant cash inflows during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were proceeds from issuance of common stock of $61,064,671 and $50,039,853, respectively, and proceeds from issuance
of notes payable of $5,000,000 and $40,900,000, respectively. 

On July 1, 2014, the Company entered into
a Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as lender, issuing bank and administrative agent for several banks and other financial institutions
and lenders ( Administrative Agent ), which was amended on June 26, 2015 and July 24, 2014 (as amended, the  Credit
Facility ).  The Credit Facility provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing amount
of $500 million. The Credit Facility matures on June 26, 2020, and is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. 

In May 2016, the borrowing base (the
 Borrowing Base ) was reduced from the initial $100 million to $60 million. The Borrowing Base is subject to
periodic redeterminations, mandatory reductions and further adjustments from time to time. The Borrowing Base is
subject to redetermination semi-annually on each May 1 and November 1.  The Borrowing Base will also be reduced in
certain circumstances such as the sale or disposition of certain oil and gas properties of the Company or its subsidiaries
and cancellation of certain hedging positions. 

The Credit Facility allows for Eurodollar
Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Credit Facility).  The interest rate on each Eurodollar Loan will be the
adjusted LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus a margin between 1.75% and 2.75% (depending on the then-current level of
borrowing base usage).  The annual interest rate on each Base Rate Loan is (a) the greatest of (i) the Administrative Agent s
prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% per annum or the (iii) adjusted LIBOR determined on a daily basis for
an interest period of one-month, plus 1.00% per annum, plus (b) a margin between 2.75% and 3.75% (depending on the then-current
level of borrowing base usage).   

The Credit Facility contains certain covenants,
which, among other things, require the maintenance of (i) a total leverage ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a
minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events
of default. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Facility, and no
amounts were outstanding on the Credit Facility. 

To the extent possible, we intend to acquire
producing properties and/or developed undrilled properties rather than exploratory properties. We do not intend to limit our evaluation
to any one state. We presently have no intention to evaluate off-shore properties or properties located outside of the United States. 

The pursuit of and acquisition of additional
oil and gas properties may require substantially greater capital than we currently have available, and obtaining additional capital
would require that we enter into the sale of either short-term or long-term notes payable or the sale of our common stock. Furthermore,
it may be necessary for us to retain outside consultants and others in our endeavors to locate desirable oil and gas properties.
The cost to retain one or more consultants or a firm specializing in the purchase and sale of oil and gas properties would have
an impact on our financial position and our future cash flows. 

The process of acquiring one or more additional
oil and gas properties will impact our financial position and reduce our cash position. The types of costs that we may incur include
travel costs relating to meeting with individuals instrumental to our acquisition of one or more oil and gas properties, obtaining
petroleum engineer reports relative to the oil and gas properties that we are investigating, legal fees associated with any such
acquisitions including title reports, and accounting fees relative to obtaining historical information regarding such oil and gas
properties. Even though we may incur such costs, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be able to consummate a transaction
resulting in our acquisition of an oil and/or gas property. 

Effects of Inflation and Pricing   

The oil and natural gas industry is very
cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry puts extreme
pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase,
so do all associated costs. Material changes in prices impact the current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing
base calculations of bank loans and the value of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact
the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel. We anticipate
business costs will vary in accordance with commodity prices for oil and natural gas, and the associated increase or decrease in
demand for services related to production and exploration. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company does not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements, and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Disclosures About Market Risks   

Like other natural resource producers,
the Company faces certain unique market risks. The most salient risk factors are the volatile prices of oil and gas, operational
risks, ability to integrate properties and businesses, and certain environmental concerns and obligations. 

Oil and Gas Prices  

The price we receive for our oil and natural
gas will heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities
and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. The
prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following: worldwide
and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of imports
of foreign oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas inventories; localized supply and demand fundamentals;
the availability of refining capacity; price and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity; weather
conditions and natural disasters; governmental regulations; speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading
of oil and natural gas futures contracts; price and availability of competitors  supplies of oil and natural gas; energy
conservation and environmental measures; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative
fuels and energy sources; and domestic and international drilling activity. 

Oil prices and natural gas prices have
declined significantly.  Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues, but may also reduce the amount
of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and, therefore, potentially lower our oil and gas reserves.  A
substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may result in further impairments of our proved oil and gas properties
and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.  

Transportation of Oil and Natural Gas  

Ring is presently committed to use the
services of the existing gatherers in its present areas of production. This gives such gatherers certain short term relative monopolistic
powers to set gathering and transportation costs. Obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company would require substantial
additional costs since an alternative gatherer would be required to lay new pipeline and/or obtain new rights-of-way. 

Competition in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry  

We operate in a highly competitive environment
for developing and acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. As a relatively
small oil and natural gas company, many large producers possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially
greater than ours. Those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial
or personnel resources permit. It is also significant that more favorable prices can usually be negotiated for larger quantities
of oil and/or gas product, such that Ring views itself as having a price disadvantage compared to larger producers. 

Retention of Key Personnel  

We depend to a large extent on the services
of our officers. These individuals have extensive experience in the energy industry, as well as expertise in evaluating and analyzing
producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties and
developing and executing financing strategies. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and business prospects. Our success may be dependent on our ability to continue to retain and utilize skilled executive
and technical personnel. 

Environmental and Regulatory Risks  

Our business and operations are subject
to and impacted by a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the exploration for and development,
production, and marketing of oil and natural gas, the operation of oil and natural gas wells, taxation, and environmental and safety
matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production, prevention of
waste and other matters. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production in order
to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil
and natural gas, byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas
operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations. 

Currently, federal regulations provide
that drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural
gas are exempt from regulation as  hazardous waste.  From time to time, legislation has been proposed to eliminate
or modify this exemption. Should the exemption be modified or eliminated, wastes associated with oil and natural gas exploration
and production would be subject to more stringent regulation. On the federal level, operations on our properties may be subject
to various federal statutes, including the Natural Gas Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act, as well as by regulations promulgated pursuant to these actions. 

Historically, most of the environmental
regulation of oil and gas production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is
significant gas and oil production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency.
However, while the Company believes this generally to be the case for its production activities in Texas and Kansas, it should
be noted that there are various Environmental Protection Agency regulations which would govern significant spills, blow-outs, or
uncontrolled emissions. In Texas, specific oil and gas regulations exist related to the drilling, completion and operations of
wells, as well as disposal of waste oil. There are also procedures incident to the plugging and abandonment of dry holes or other
non-operational wells, all as governed by the Texas Railroad Commission, Oil and Gas Division and the Kansas Corporation Commission,
Oil and Gas Conservation Division. 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and
common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection
of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process
is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the Environmental Protection Agency has asserted federal regulatory
authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide
for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Certain
states, including Texas, and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that have imposed, or that could
impose, more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. 

Compliance with these regulations may
result in increased expenses and additional management time required of Ring. No specific accounting for environmental compliance
has been maintained or projected by Ring to date. Ring does not presently know of any environmental demands, claims, or adverse
actions, litigation or administrative proceedings in which it or its properties are involved or subject to or arising out of its
predecessor operations. 

In the event of a breach of environmental
regulations, these environmental regulatory agencies have a broad range of alternative or cumulative remedies including: ordering
a cleanup of any spills or waste material and restoration of the soil or water to conditions existing prior to the environmental
violation; fines; or enjoining further drilling, completion or production activities. In certain egregious situations, the agencies
may also pursue criminal remedies against the Company or its principals. 

Changes in regulations and laws relating
to the oil and natural gas industry could result in our operations being disrupted or curtailed by government authorities. For
example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may become less cost effective and decline as a result of increasingly
stringent environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns and delays or difficulties
in obtaining environmental permits). A decline in exploration and production, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  

Interest Rate Risk  

The Company is subject to market risk exposure
related to changes in interest rates on its indebtedness under its Credit Facility, which bears variable interest based upon a
prime rate and is therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on
the Company s cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had no amount outstanding on its Credit Facility. 

Currently, the Company does not use interest
rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. 

Commodity Price Risk  

Our major market risk exposure is in the
pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and
natural gas prices. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable
to the region in which we produce natural gas. Historically, prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile
and unpredictable. We expect pricing volatility to continue. 

The prices we receive depend on many factors
outside of our control. Oil prices we received during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, ranged from a low of $24.78
per barrel to a high of $45.94 per barrel. Natural gas prices we received during the same period ranged from a low of $0.81 per
Mcf to a high of $3.31 per Mcf. A significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations. In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability
relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we may enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements
with respect to a portion of our expected production. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not entered into any hedging or
derivative instruments for our expected oil and natural gas production. 

The Company s revenues, profitability
and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow
available for capital expenditures and Ring s ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount the Company can
borrow under our Credit Facility is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices.
Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company can economically produce. Ring currently sells
all of its oil and natural gas production under price sensitive or market price contracts. 

Customer Credit
Risk   

Our
principal exposures to credit risk is through receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $3.0
million at September 30, 2016) and through receivables from our joint interest partners (approximately $611 thousand at September
30, 2016). We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with our most significant
customers. We do not require our customers to post collateral, and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations
to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.   For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales to two customers,  Occidental Energy Marketing ( Oxy ) and Enterprise
Crude Oil LLC ( Enterprise )  represented 48% and 43% of oil and gas revenues,
respectively. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, Oxy and Enterprise represented 43% and 43% of our accounts receivable,
respectively. Due to availability of other purchasers, we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  

Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

Foreign sales accounted for none of the
Company s sales; further, the Company accepts payment for its commodity sales only in U.S. dollars. Ring is therefore not
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on these sales. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures   

Our management,
with the participation of Kelly W. Hoffman, our principal executive officer, and William R. Broaddrick, our principal financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on management s evaluation,
Mssrs. Hoffman and Broaddrick concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
filing were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

We will continue
to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting
on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary
and as funds allow. 

Changes in internal control over
financial reporting   

We regularly review our system of
internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency,
while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing
new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities

an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock, including 1,500,000 shares sold pursuant to the full
exercise of an over-allotment option previously granted by the underwriters, pursuant to an effective registration statement on
Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-200324), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3,
2014.  The shares were sold at the public offering price of $5.60 per share.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and Seaport

or indirectly, to any director, officer or 10% owner.  Out of the proceeds of the offering, the Company paid all principal
of $50.9 million and related interest of approximately $215,000 outstanding under its Credit Facility and used approximately $10
million for leasing activities, development of existing properties and working capital.
