  August 31, 2016     Note 1.   Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies    The interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Video Display Corporation
and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the  Company ) after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.  
 As contemplated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC  or  Commission ) instructions to Form 10-Q, the
following footnotes have been condensed and, therefore, do not contain all disclosures required in connection with annual consolidated financial statements. Reference should be made to the Company s year-end consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto, including a description of the accounting policies followed by the Company, contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, as filed with the Commission. There are no
material changes in significant accounting policies during the six months ended August 31, 2016.    The interim condensed consolidated
financial information included in this report has been prepared by the Company, without audit. In the opinion of management, the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this report contains all adjustments (all of which are
normal and recurring) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. Nevertheless, the results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The February 29,
2016 consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).  
 Note 2.   Banking   Liquidity    The
accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained
losses for each of the last two years and has seen a decline in both its working capital and liquid assets during this time. These losses were a combination of low revenues at all divisions without a commensurate reduction of expenses. During the
year ended February 29, 2016, the Company operated using cash from operations of $0.8 million, which was primarily generated from a $0.7 million tax refund that was non-recurring in nature. During the six months ended August 31, 2016
operational cash flows used $1.0 million. Related to these operational results the Company s working capital and liquid asset position are presented below (in thousands) as of the six months ended August 31, 2016 and the year-ended
February 29, 2016:      
   Management has implemented a plan to improve the liquidity of the Company. The Company has been implementing a
plan to increase revenues at all the divisions, each structured to the particular division with an increase in the current backlog and growth in revenues. The Company has a plan to reduce expenses at the divisions, as well as at the corporate
location with the expectation that expenses will be decreased by more than $1.7 million per year. Management continues to explore options to monetize certain long-term assets of the business, including current negotiations to sell its Lexel Imaging
subsidiary, presented as discontinued operations, where a final sale is expected during fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. The Company secured a $500 thousand line of credit on September 14, 2016. If additional and more permanent
capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.

  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of
management s plans to improve revenues, the operational effectiveness of continuing operations, to liquidate the subsidiary noted above, the procurement of suitable financing, or a combination of these. The uncertainty regarding the potential
success of management s plan create substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.    Note 3.   Fair Value
Measurements and Financial Instruments    The Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB s) fair value measurement guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
fair value:       

Level 1 
    
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis.  

Level 2 
    
 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level 3 
    
 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
 
  Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company consist of investment securities held
for trading using Level 1 inputs. The following table sets forth our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 (in thousands):

  August 31, 2016       
  The Company s financial instruments which are not measured at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheets include cash, accounts receivable, short-term liabilities, and debt. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximate cost due to the short period of time to maturity. Recorded amounts of long-term
debt are considered to approximate fair value due to either rates that fluctuate with the market or are otherwise commensurate with the current market. 
 Note 4.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 In May, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. (ASU) 2014-09   Revenue with Contracts from Customers .  ASU
2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The new guidance: (i) removes inconsistencies, and weaknesses in
revenue requirements, (ii) provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, (iii) improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, (iv) provides
more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, and (v) simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.  
 The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting
period; however, a one year delay has been approved with the issuance of ASU 2015-14,   Revenue with Contracts from Customers  . The Company is still evaluating the effects that the adoption of this update will have on the
Company s consolidated financial statements.    In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial
Statements. Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern .  Prior to its effective date there was no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This update requires that an entity s management should evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date
that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable.) This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is still evaluating the
effects that the adoption of this update will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and
related interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  ASU 2015-17 requires
deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with related valuation allowances, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not
change the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02
increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about the lease arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.    Note 5. Inventories  
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market and consisted of the following (in thousands):  
   
   Note 6.   Costs and Estimated Earnings Related to Billings on Uncompleted Contracts  
 Information relative to contracts in progress consisted of the following:  
   
   Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are the results of contracts in progress (jobs) in
completing orders to customers  specifications on contracts accounted for under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. ASC 605-35,   Revenue Recognition: Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts .  Costs included
are material, labor, and overhead. These jobs require design and engineering effort for a specific customer purchasing a unique product. The Company records revenue on these fixed-price and cost-plus contracts on the percentage of completion basis
using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward

  completion and revenue recognition. Any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately. Contract
accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. With respect to contract change orders, claims, or similar items, judgment must be used
in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Billings are generated based on specific contract terms,
which might be a progress payment schedule, specific shipments, etc. None of the above contracts in progress contain post-shipment obligations.  
 Changes in job performance, manufacturing efficiency, final contract settlements, and other factors affecting estimated profitability may
result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.    As of August 31,
2016, there were no production costs that exceeded the aggregate estimated cost of all in process and delivered units relating to long-term contracts. Additionally, there were no claims outstanding that would affect the ultimate realization of full
contract values. As of August 31, 2016, there were no progress payments that had been netted against inventory.    Note 7.   Long-Term Debt and
Other Obligations    Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):  
   
   The Company had outstanding margin account borrowings of $0.2 million as of August 31, 2016 and $0.4
million as of February 29, 2016. The margin account borrowings are used to purchase marketable equity securities and are netted against the investments in the balance sheet to show net trading investments. The gross investments were $0.5
million leaving net investments of $0.3 million after the margin account borrowings of $0.2 million for the period ending August 31, 2016 and $0.5 million leaving net investments of $0.1 million after the margin account borrowings of $0.4
million for the period ending February 29, 2016, respectively. The margin interest rate is 2%.    Note 8.   Related Party Transactions  
 The Company owed the Company s Chief Executive Officer $85 thousand as of February 29, 2016. This money was borrowed during the
Company s fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 at an eight percent interest rate. The Company repaid the funds during the first quarter ending May 31, 2016. Interest paid on this loan during the quarter was $1 thousand.

  On March 30, 2016, the Company entered into an assignment with recourse of the note
receivable from Z-Axis Inc. (Z-Axis) with Ronald D. Ordway, CEO, and Jonathan R. Ordway, related parties, for the sum of $912 thousand. The note receivable is collateralized by a security interest in the shares of Z-Axis as well as a personal
guaranty of its majority shareholder. Z-Axis is current on all scheduled payments regarding this note. The Company retains the right to repurchase the note at any time for 80% of the outstanding principle balance. Also, in the event of default by
Z-Axis, the Company is obligated to repurchase the note for 80% of the remaining principle balance plus any accrued interest. Accordingly, the Company has recognized this transaction as a secured borrowing in accordance with the provisions of ASC
860-10. The $ 0.9 million, 9% interest rate, note originated on March 30, 2016, with payments beginning on April 16, 2016 and continuing for 56 months thereafter. The balance of the note at August 31, 2016 was $846 thousand.  
 Note 9.   Supplemental Cash Flow Information  
 Supplemental cash flow information is as follows (in thousands):      
   Note 10.   Shareholder s Equity  
  Earnings (Loss) Per Share     Basic earnings
(loss) per share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Shares issued during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that
they were outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated in a manner consistent with that of basic earnings (loss) per share while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.

  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share
for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share data):      
    Stock-Based Compensation Plans   
 For the six-month period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized general and administrative expenses of $2.8 thousand and
$6.8 thousand, respectively, related to share-based compensation. The liability for the share-based compensation recognized is presented in the consolidated balance sheet as part of additional paid in capital. As of August 31, 2016, total
unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options granted was $1.9 thousand. The unrecognized stock option compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 1 year.  
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the Company to
estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the term. The term represents the expected period of time the Company believes the options will remain outstanding based on historical information.
Estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the Company s common stock, which represents the standard deviation of the differences in the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for dividends and
stock splits.    No options were granted during the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and ten thousand options were granted for
the six months ended August 31, 2015, respectively.

   Stock Repurchase Program   
 The Company has a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which it had been authorized to repurchase up to 2,632,500 shares of the Company s
common stock in the open market. On January 20, 2014 the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-time continuation of the stock repurchase program, and authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares of the
Company s common stock in the open market. There is no minimum number of shares required to be repurchased under the program.    For
the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company did not purchase any shares of Video Display Corporation stock. For the six months ended August 31, 2015, the Company purchased 68,531 shares at an average price of $1.63 per share. Under
the Company s stock repurchase program, an additional 502,644 shares remain authorized to be repurchased by the Company at August 31, 2016.  
 Note 11.   Income Taxes    The effective tax
rate for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0%. The Company lost $0.8 and $2.9 million dollars for the six months ending August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, which resulted in a tax benefit of
approximately $0.3 and $1.1 million, respectively. Due to the losses by the Company, a full valuation allowance was allocated to the deferred tax asset created by the loss. The net effect of this allowance was to have zero tax expense for the
quarter.    Note 12.   Discontinued Operations  
 On March 26, 2014 with an effective date of February 28, 2014, the Company completed the sale of the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Lexel Imaging, Inc. to Citadal Partners, LLC for approximately $3.9 million, consisting of $1.0 million cash payable over 180 days in the form of a note receivable and a guarantee to purchase $2.9 million in inventory over a five year
period. The inventory was adjusted to its net realizable value as part of the sale. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of $4.4 million pre-tax during the year ended February 28, 2014.  
 On November 17, 2014 Video Display reacquired Lexel Imaging, Inc. when Citadal Partners, LLC defaulted on two notes payable to Video
Display Corporation owed as financing on the original sale of the Lexel Imaging. Lexel Imaging is still presented as discontinued operations as Video Display Corporation is still considering offers for the sale of the entity.

plan to increase revenues at all the divisions, each structured to the particular division with an increase in the current backlog and growth in revenues. The Company has a plan to reduce expenses at the divisions, as well as at the corporate
location with the expectation that expenses will be decreased by more than $1.7 million per year. Management continues to explore options to monetize certain long-term assets of the business, including current negotiations to sell its Lexel Imaging
subsidiary, which is presented as discontinued operations, where a final sale is expected during fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. The Company secured a $500 thousand line of credit on September 14, 2016. If additional and more
permanent capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.  
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of management s plans to improve revenues, the
operational effectiveness of continuing operations, to liquidate the subsidiary noted above, the procurement of suitable financing, or a combination of these. The uncertainty regarding the potential success of management s plan create
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.      Inventory management     The
Company s business units utilize different inventory components than the divisions had in the past. The Company has a monthly reserve at each of its divisions to offset any obsolescence although most purchases are for current orders, which
should reduce the amount of obsolescence in the future. The Company still has CRT inventory in stock and, although it believes the inventory will be sold in the future, will continue to reserve for any additional obsolescence. Management believes
the adequacy of its inventory reserves at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 to be adequate.     Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth, for the three and six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the percentages that selected items in the
Statements of Operations bear to total sales:

    Net sales   
 Consolidated net sales were down 33.2% and 27.8% for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months
ended August 31, 2015. The Display Systems division posted decreases for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016 of 41.5% and 38.3% respectively compared to the three months and six months ended August 31, 2015. The
Display System division was down $1.16 million for the six month period primarily due to contracts being delayed with a major military supplier. The Data Display CRT division had a decrease of 43.8% and 41.0% in sales for the three months and six
months ending August 31, 2016 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to delays in getting product for its major customer. In addition, during the prior year the division had some last time buy sales that did not repeat in the
current year. AYON Cyber Security was up 4.7% for the three months and 0.6% for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months and six months ended August 31, 2015. AYON Visual Solutions was down 31.5% for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015, but is up 51.7% for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. The Company expects Display Systems, AYON
Cyber Security and AYON Visual Solutions to show positive results in the next quarter as the backlog for each division remains strong.     Gross
margins     Consolidated gross margins increased by 13.6% for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared the three months ended
August 31, 2015 and were flat for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. The gross margins improved substantially for the three months ended August 31, 2016 at $284 thousand
compared to $32 thousand for the three months ended May 31, 2016 on a 4.8% sales increase over the previous quarter.    For the three
months ending August 31, 2016, the gross margin improvement was at the Display Systems and AYON Cyber Security divisions where both experienced small increases in sales, but reduced operating costs in both fixed and variable costs to improve
their gross margins. The Company expects gross margins will continue to improve due to increases in the revenue base and tighter controls on costs. The past three months were an improvement over the first three months of the fiscal year. The Company
expects the trend to continue for the remainder of the year.     Operating expenses   
 Total operating expenses decreased by $196 thousand or 18.0% for the three months ending August 31, 2016 compared to the three months
ending August 31, 2015 and decreased by $416 thousand or 19.2% for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. The Company s reduction in actual operating expenses was a result of
strategic cuts in personnel, corporate operating expenses and professional services. The Company expects to continue to contain these costs while increasing revenues.

   Interest expense   
 Interest expense was $3.4 thousand for the three months and $8.7 thousand for the six months ending August 31, 2016 compared to $18.0
thousand for the three months and $40.3 thousand for the six months ending August 31, 2015. The Company also earned $8.7 thousand for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and $50.5 thousand in interest income for six months ending
August 31, 2015. The interest expense (approximately $1.0 thousand per month) is related to the balance owed on a building the Company owns in Pennsylvania and the interest on the margin balance in the Company s investment account, which
is a 2% rate.     Other expense     For
the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company experienced gains of $133 thousand and $212 thousand, respectively. For the three months and six months ended August 31, 2015 the Company lost $1.0 million and $1.4
million, respectively. The Company had $178 thousand in investment gains, $60 thousand in rental income, $17 thousand in scrap sales and $9 thousand in dividend income offset by $92 thousand in asset disposals. Last year, the Company was invested
heavily in energy stocks, which fared poorly due to the decline in the price of oil. For the six months ended August 31, 2015 the losses were due primarily to losses in the investment account of $1.7 million offset by dividend income of $0.3
million and rental income of $0.1 million     Income taxes   
 The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0%. The Company lost $0.8 and $2.9 million dollars for the
six months ending August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $0.3 and $1.1 million, respectively. Due to the losses by the Company, a full valuation allowance was allocated to the
deferred tax asset created by the loss. The net effect of this allowance was to have zero tax expense for the quarter.     Discontinued operations 
   On March 26, 2014 with an effective date of February 28, 2014, the Company completed the sale of the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Lexel Imaging, Inc. to Citadal Partners, LLC for approximately $3.9 million, consisting of $1.0 million cash payable over 180 days in the form of a note receivable and a guarantee to purchase $2.9 million in inventory over a five-year
period. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of $4.4 million pre-tax during the year ended February 28, 2014.    On
November 17, 2014 Video Display reacquired Lexel Imaging, Inc. when Citadal Partners, LLC defaulted on two notes payable to Video Display Corporation owed as financing on the original sale of the Lexel Imaging. Lexel Imaging is still presented
as discontinued operations as Video Display Corporation is still considering offers for the sale of the entity.    Lexel Imaging earned $0.4
million for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and $0.2 million for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The income increase is due primarily to a royalty received this year of $0.2 million. The subsidiary has a backlog in excess of
$5.5 million.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained losses for each of the last two years. These losses were a combination of low revenues at all divisions without a commensurate reduction of
expenses. During the year ended February 29, 2016, the Company operated using cash from operations of $0.8 million, which was primarily generated from a $0.7 million tax refund that was non-recurring in nature. During the six months ended
August 31, 2016 operational cash flows used $1.0 million. Related to these operational results the Company s working capital and liquid asset position are presented below (in thousands) as of the six months ended August 31, 2016 and
the year-ended February 29, 2016:      
   Management has implemented a plan to improve the liquidity of the Company. The Company has been implementing a
plan to increase revenues at all the divisions, each structured to the particular division with an increase in the current backlog and growth in revenues. The Company has a plan to reduce expenses at the divisions, as well as at the corporate
location with the expectation that expenses will be decreased by more than $1.7 million per year. Management continues to explore options to monetize certain long-term assets of the business, including current negotiations to sell its Lexel Imaging
subsidiary, presented as discontinued operations, where a final sale is expected during fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. The Company secured a $500 thousand line of credit on September 14, 2016. If additional and more permanent
capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.  
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of management s plans to improve revenues, the
operational effectiveness of continuing operations, to liquidate the subsidiary noted above, the procurement of suitable financing, or a combination of these. The uncertainty regarding the potential success of management s plan create
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.    Cash used in operations for the six months ended
August 31, 2016 was $1.0 million. The net loss from operations was $0.8 million and adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash was $0.3 million, primarily the $0.5 million earned on discontinued operations, $0.2 million on realized and
unrealized gains from investments offset by $0.3 million for depreciation and inventory reserves. Changes in working capital had no effect due to an increase in customer deposits of $1.8 million, an increase in accounts payable of $0.8 million
offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $1.5 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.0 million. Cash provided by operations for the six months ended August 31, 2015 was $0.5 million. The net loss from operations was $2.9
million and adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash were $1.8 million including realized and unrealized loss on investments of $1.7 million, a gain from discontinued operations of $0.3 million and depreciation and reserves change of $0.4
million. Changes in working capital provided $1.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in prepaid taxes due to a $0.7 million refund from the federal government and states, a decrease in inventories of $1.1 million, and a decrease in accounts
receivable of $0.7 million offset by a decrease in payables of $0.5 million and smaller adjustments totaling $0.2 million.    Investing
activities provided $381 thousand for the six months ended August 31, 2016. The Company received $428 thousand in cash repayments from Lexel Imaging and had net investments of $197 thousand offset by capital expenditures of $244 thousand. For
the six months ended August 31, 2015, the Company had investing activities provided cash of $2.4 million due to the proceeds of $2.3 million from the sale of investments, cash advance from discontinued operations of $0.2 million and capital
expenditures of $0.1 million.

  Financing activities provided $0.6 million for the six months ended August 31, 2016. The
Company received $0.9 million from related party loans, offset by $0.2 million of marginal float in the investment account and $0.1 million of repayments of related party loans and long term debt. Financing activities used cash of $2.5 million,
primarily for the repayment of marginal float on the investment account of $2.4 and the repurchase of treasury stock and used cash of $0.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2015.  
 The Company has a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which it has been authorized to repurchase up to 2,632,500 shares of the
Company s common stock in the open market. On January 20, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-time continuation of the stock repurchase program, and authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,500,000 additional
shares of the Company s common stock on the open market, depending on the market price of the shares. There is no minimum number of shares required to be repurchased under the program. For the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company
did not repurchase any shares. For the six months ended August 31, 2015, the Company repurchased 68,531 shares at an average price of $1.63 per share. Under the Company s stock repurchase program, an additional 502,644 shares remain
authorized to be repurchased by the Company at August 31, 2016.     Critical Accounting Estimates   
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon the Company s interim condensed
consolidated financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in
the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity include reserves on inventories, revenue recognition, the allowance for bad
debts and warranty reserves. The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates:     Reserves on Inventories   
 Reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost. Management regularly
reviews the Company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount. Management reviews inventory levels on a
quarterly basis. Such reviews include observations of product development trends of the original equipment manufacturers, new products being marketed, and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the Company s existing
inventories. Management believes the adequacy of its inventory reserves at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 to be adequate.     Revenue
Recognition     Revenue is recognized on the sale of products when the products are shipped, all significant contractual obligations have
been satisfied, and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company s delivery term typically is F.O.B. shipping point.  
 In accordance with ASC 605-45   Revenue Recognition: Principal Agent Considerations  , shipping and handling fees billed to
customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated income statements. Shipping and handling costs incurred are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated income statements.

  A portion of the Company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture simulation
systems to a buyers  specification. These contracts are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 605-35   Revenue Recognition :  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts  . These contracts are fixed-price and
cost-plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. Any losses
identified on contracts are recognized immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. With respect to contract
change orders, claims, or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is
probable.     Other Loss Contingencies   
 Other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is
reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires
analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties.     Income Taxes   
 Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 the Company has established a valuation allowance of $7.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively on the Company s current
and non-current deferred tax assets.    The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of ASC 740, which contains a
two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company
considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the Company s tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments. At August 31, 2016, the Company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In May,
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. (ASU) 2014-09   Revenue with Contracts from Customers .  ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and
International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The new guidance: (i) removes inconsistencies, and weaknesses in revenue requirements, (ii) provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, (iii) improves
comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, (iv) provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, and
(v) simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.    The
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period; however, a one year delay has been approved with the issuance of ASU 2015-14,   Revenue with
Contracts from Customers  . The Company is still evaluating the effects that the adoption of this update will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements.
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern .  Prior to its effective date there was no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This update requires that an entity s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the
financial statements are available to be issued when applicable.) This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is still evaluating the effects
that the adoption of this update will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In July 2015,
the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and related
interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  ASU 2015-17 requires
deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with related valuation allowances, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not
change the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 increases transparency and comparability among
organizations by requiring entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about the lease arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  Subsequent Events     The Company secured a
$500 thousand line of credit with the Brand Bank during the month of September, 2016. The line of credit will be used for working capital purposes. It is secured by the assets of the Company and a personal guarantee of the Company s Chief
Executive Officer.     Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors

1. 
 I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Video Display Corporation;        

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which

4.

a) 
 designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;        

b) 
 designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;        

c) 
 evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

 disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and    

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):        

a) 
 all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; and        

b) 
 any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.
