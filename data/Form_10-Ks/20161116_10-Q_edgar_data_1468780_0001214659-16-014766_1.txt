Description of Business and History

Powin Energy Corporation ( Company ,  we ,  us ) was founded in 1989 in Oregon under its original name of Powin Corporation by Joseph Lu, who developed a strategy of manufacturing a number of diverse products for leading North American retailers, with careful attention to quality and value-added service. As a contract manufacturer, the Company provides manufacturing coordination, design and logistics services for companies to outsource its manufacturing needs. Manufacturing is provided through the Company s subsidiary, Q Pacific Manufacturing Corporation ( Q Pacific Manufacturing ), with a leased metal fabrication plant in Tualatin, Oregon; its 100% owned subsidiary in Mexico, with a leased metal fabrication plant in Saltillo; or through very strong relationships with factories located in The People s Republic of China and in Taiwan.

Throughout its life-cycle, the Company has expanded into additional lines of business, all based on the values of delivering customers a high quality product and value-added service. For the periods presented the Company have the following subsidiaries:

The Company s client base includes distributors in the transportation, medical, sports, camping, fitness, and packaging and furniture industries.  Operations outside the United States of America are subject to risks inherent in operating under different legal systems and various political and economic environments.  Among the risks are changes in existing tax laws, possible limitations on foreign investment and income repatriation, government price or foreign exchange controls, and restrictions on currency exchange.

Effective October 3, 2016(see Note13  14), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Powin Industries, SA de CV ( Powin Mexico ) and Rolland Holding Company, LLC ( Rolland )pursuant to which   Company sold to Rolland 99 shares of  the Series A Common Stock and the 167,452 shares of the Series B Common Stock of  Powin Mexico  which represents 99% of the Series A Common Stock and 100% of the Series B Common Stock (collectively the  Shares ) of  Powin Mexico.  The closing date of the Agreement was October 4, 2016 ( Closing ).The purchase price for the Shares was $999,000. At Closing, Rolland made a cash payment of $99,000 and delivered to the Company (i) its promissory note in the  principal amount $100,000 bearing interest at 4% per annum with principal and interest payable in twelve (12) equal monthly installments  ( Short Term Note ) ; and (ii) its promissory note in the principal amount of $800,000 bearing interest at 5% per annum with principal and interest payable in ninety-six (96) equal monthly installments  ( Long Term Note ) . The interest rate on the Long Term Note will be renegotiated if and when the Prime Rate for the U.S reaches 5%. In addition, Powin Mexico delivered to the Company a non-interest bearing promissory note in the amount of $125,000  ( Powin Mexico Note )  which calls for four (4) equal monthly installments of $31,250 on each of December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The Powin Mexico Note represents a compromised amount representing the difference between the amount of the Powin Mexico accounts receivable and the amount of the Powin Mexico accounts payable owing to the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties and representation.  Amounts due under the Short Term Note, the Long Term Note and the Powin Mexico Note, respectively,  may be accelerated upon a failure to pay amounts due thereunder when due, unless waived or cured. As a consequence of the Purchase Agreement, Powin Mexico ceased being a subsidiary of Powin Corporation.

Effective October 18, 2016(see Note13 14), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Weiping Cai ( Cai ) pursuant to which the Company sold to  Cai all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock   ( Shares )   of   Q Pacific Corporation, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, which wholly-owns and operates Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing and Q Pacific Manufacturing Corporation, the Company s second tier subsidiaries, collectively referred to as   ( QPM )  . In addition to the sale of the Shares, the Company also transferred and assigned to Cai the Company s right, title and interest in and to the  Huntsman  tradename held by Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing Corporation. 

Basis of preparation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required by GAAP for complete annual financial statement presentation.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other interim periods or for the full year ended December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Powin Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which the Company exercises significant influence over but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.

Foreign currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income ( OCI ).

The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollars. The Company s Mexico subsidiary Powin Industries S.A. de C.V uses Mexican Peso as its functional currency. The results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rates at the balance sheet dates, and equity is translated at the historical exchange rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding accounts on the balance sheets. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statements of stockholders  equity. Translation adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(35,695) and $(25,868), respectively. Translation adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(33,126) and $(3,595), respectively. The cumulative translation adjustment and effect of exchange rate changes on cash, which was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $(91,871) and $(56,176), respectively. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.

Assets and liabilities were translated at 19.41PESO and 17.34 PESO to $1.00 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rates. The average translation rates applied to income statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 19.41PESO and 17.58 PESO to $1.00, respectively. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the period; therefore, amounts reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.

Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of management s estimates. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We maintain allowances for accounts receivable for estimated uncollectable accounts receivable due to the inability of our customers to make required payments. We maintain impairment for inventory for estimated inventory loss. We maintain allowances for returns for estimated losses resulting from product returns. These estimates have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed or delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

For product shipped directly from the Company s warehouse or manufactured by the Company in the United States and then shipped to the customer, revenue is recognized at time of shipment as it is determined that ownership and title has passed to the customer at shipment and revenue is recognized.  Amounts billed to customers for freight and shipping are classified as revenue.

Products imported from China and shipped directly to the customer may be either FOB Port of Origin or FOB Shipping Destination United States. If the product is shipped FOB Port of Origin revenue is recognized at time of delivery to the Company s representative in China, when the proper bills-of-lading have been signed by the customer s agent and ownership passed to the customer.  For product shipped FOB Shipping Destination U.S., revenue is recognized when product is off-loaded at the United States Port of Entry and delivered to the customer, when all delivery documents have been signed by the receiving customer, and ownership has passed to the customer. 

For orders placed requiring customized manufacturing, the Company requires the customer to issue its signed purchase order with documentation identifying the specifics of the product to be manufactured. Revenue is recognized on customized manufactured products upon delivery of the product.  If the customer cancels the purchase order after the manufacturing process has begun, the Company invoices the customer for any manufacturing costs incurred and revenue is recognized.  Orders canceled after delivery has occurred are fully invoiced to the customer and revenue is recognized, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

Cost of goods sold

Cost of goods sold includes cost of inventory sold during the period, net of discounts and allowances, freight and shipping costs, warranty and rework costs, and sales tax.

Advertising

The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the amount charged to advertising expense was $21,280 and $118,255, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the amount charged to advertising expense was $16,187 and $71,169, respectively.

Research and development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.

Loss Per Share

Basic loss per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic loss per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect of including such instruments is antidilutive. Please refer to Note 6 for further discussion.

Comprehensive loss

Comprehensive loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220, Comprehensive loss requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive loss be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. For the years presented, the Company s comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Cash

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of nine months or less to be cash equivalents. The cash deposits in U.S. financial institutions exceed the amounts insured by the U.S. government. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. Non-performance by these institutions could expose the Company to losses for amounts in excess of insured balances. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s bank balances exceeded insurances balances by $181,546 and $2,583,046, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus, accounts receivable do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition.  Balances outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to trade accounts receivable. Bad debt expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $1,500, respectively.

Inventories, net

Inventories consist of parts and equipment including electronic parts and components, furniture, rubber products, plastic products and exercise equipment.  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.  The Company capitalizes applicable direct and indirect costs incurred in the Company s manufacturing operations to bring its products to a sellable state. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an inventory obsolescence recovery of $0 and provision for inventory obsolescence of $49,198, respectively, which is included in cost of sales. The components of inventories were as follows:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  For financial reporting and income tax purposes, the costs of property and equipment are depreciated and amortized over the assets estimated useful lives, using principally the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated method for income tax purposes.  Costs associated with repair and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.  Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, changes to the Company s business model or capital strategy could result in actual useful lives differing from the Company s estimates.  In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense.

9 

The Company depreciates property and equipment over the following estimated useful lives:

The Company reviews the carrying value of property, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. Based on this assessment, no impairment expenses for property, and equipment was recorded in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Intangible Assets

All of our intangible assets include websites and also patents that are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from 3 to 5 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicates the asset may be impaired.

Non-controlling interests

As of September 30, 2016, non-controlling interests on the consolidated financial statements represented the minority stockholders  proportionate share of the net income/losses of the Company, an 82.35% owned subsidiary from April 2, 2015.

On August 8, 2014, the Company and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Powin Energy Corporation (collectively  Powin ) and SF Suntech, Inc. ( Suntech ) signed a Share Subscription Agreement ( Subscription Agreement ) for an investment of $12,500,000 from Suntech. On April 1, 2015 and April 2, 2015, Powin Energy issued 1,765 shares and 378 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock to Suntech, respectively. Professional expenses of $750,000 related to the issuances were deducted from the proceeds received. After the shares issuance, the Company owns 82.35% of Powin Energy.

Non-controlling interests on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 includes minority interest of Mexico, an 85% owned subsidiary from February 2011 to January 2016. On January 2016, the company spent $15,747 and bought the 15% minority interest in the company s Mexico subsidiary. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owns 100% of the Mexico subsidiary.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company calculates a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns, judgment and interpretation of statutes is required. Additionally, the Company uses tax planning strategies as a part of its tax compliance program. Judgments and interpretation of statutes are inherent in this process.

The accounting guidance for uncertainties in income tax prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits and a consideration of the relevant taxing authority s widely understood administrative practices and precedents.

10 

Prior to July 8, 2008, the Company had elected under the Internal Revenue Code to be taxed as an S Corporation.  In lieu of corporation income taxes, the stockholder of an S Corporation is taxed on his proportionate share of the Company s taxable income. Due to the merger on July 8, 2008, the Company is now subject to Federal income tax.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair value accounting guidance defines fair value as  the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The definition is based on an exit price rather than an entry price, regardless of whether the entity plans to hold or sell the asset. This guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1:  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level 2:  Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The carrying value of the Company s equipment borrowing and short term line of credit borrowing at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is considered to approximate fair market value, as the interest rates of these instruments are based predominantly on variable reference rates. The carrying value of accounts receivable, trade payables and accrued liabilities approximates the fair value due to their short-term maturities.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures stock-based compensation expense for all share-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant-date under ASC 718.  The cost of restricted stock awards is determined using the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.  The fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The compensation costs are recognized net of any estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at grant-date based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for any differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Not Adopted

The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.

Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities.

Currently, GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.

This ASU provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.

The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.

The FASB and IASB (the Boards) have issued converged standards on revenue recognition. Specifically, the Boards have issued the following documents:

IFRS 15,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  

The issuance of these documents completes the joint effort by the Boards to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition,   and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,   Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.   In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360,   Property, Plant, and Equipment,   and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350,   Intangibles Goodwill and Other)   are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.

The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.

Step 3: Determine the transaction price.

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.

Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

For a public entity, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted.

Segment reporting

ASC 280, Segment Reporting, formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. Under this model, segment reporting is consistent with the manner that the Company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.

The Company has never paid a cash dividend and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, so the dividend yield used in the calculation is 0%.The expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of comparative companies, measured over the expected term of the option.  The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield on a United States Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term closest to the expected term of the option. The term of the option is the expiration as there is no ready market for employees to exercise and sell shares and to date no option has been exercised on the 2011 plan.

Effective April 2, 2015, Powin and Suntech signed the Fourth Supplemental Agreement ( Supplement ).Under the Supplement, the First Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement was April 2, 2015 ( First Closing ) at which time Suntech made a payment to Powin in the amount of $7,450,000. That payment plus the previous payments of $3,000,000 on August 29, 2014; $2,000,000 on January 15, 2015 and $50,000 on March 2, 2015 represent a total $12,500,000 paid toward the full $25,000,000 owing under the Subscription Agreement.

After this transaction, Powin Corporation's ownership interest in Powin Energy is 82.35%. Since, Powin Corporation retained its controlling financial interest in Powin Energy after the shares issuance for cash to Suntech; the sale of the subsidiary shares was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810-10-45-23.

If that payment was made, Powin would issue to Suntech an additional 2,143 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock.  In the event Suntech was unable or unwilling to pay the remaining subscription balance, Powin would be free to sell the 2,143 shares to another purchaser for the same price per share as paid by Suntech. Suntech failed to make the required payment on May 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company elected to terminate the Subscription Agreement, as it pertained to the remaining $12,500,000 owing thereunder.

The difference of purchase price and balance of non-controlling interest is booked as additional paid in capital.

Results of Continuing Operations

The following table presents the Company s revenues for its remaining business segment Powin Energy, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

25 

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $29,000 or 71.1% from the same period of 2015due to a pause in sales of our electrical vehicle charge stations. Powin Energy has been focusing on the commercialization of its electricity storage products and expects to book orders in 2016.

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $286,000 or 22.4%, from $1.27 million in the same period of 2015 to $0.99 million.  Decrease is primarily due to shift from product research and development on prior year to production on current year.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had net loss of approximately $1.02 million or $0.04 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $1.28 million or $0.06 per share for the same period of 2015.

The following table presents the Company s revenues for its remaining business segment Powin Energy, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $94,000 or 74.0% from the same period of 2015due to a pause in sales of our electrical vehicle charge stations. Powin Energy has been focusing on the commercialization of its electricity storage products and expects to book orders in 2016.

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $480,000 or 14.0%, from $3.43 million in the same period of 2015 to $2.94 million.  Decrease is primarily due to shift from product research and development on prior year to production on current year.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had net loss of approximately $3.00 million or $0.13 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $3.54 million or $0.17 per share for the same period of 2015.

Discontinued Operations

Net sales from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $253,000 or 10.1% from the same period of 2015. The decrease is due to reduce demand from Daimler Truck North America.

Operating expenses from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased approximately $0.69 million or 99.6%, from $0.69 million in the same period of 2015 to $1.38 million.  Increase is primarily due to write off of net intercompany AP and AR balance carried over several prior years.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net loss from discontinued operations were approximately $0.97 million or $0.04 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $0.43 million or $0.03 per share for the same period of 2015.

Net sales from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased approximately $1,132,000 or 13.7% from the same period of 2015. The decrease is due to reduce demand from Daimler Truck North America.

Operating expenses from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased approximately $703,000 or 33.0%, from $2.13 million in the same period of 2015 to $2.83 million.  Increase is primarily due to write off of net intercompany AP and AR balance carried over several prior years.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net loss from discontinued operations were approximately $1.72 million or $0.09 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $0.94 million or $0.06 per share for the same period of 2015.

2016 Outlook

In 2016, Powin Energy Corporation entered into sale agreements for Powin Industries S.A. de CV and Q Pacific Corporation, which contained Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing (OEM) and Q Pacific Manufacturing (QBF).  Both sales occurred in October 2016, subsequent to Q3 2016.  The sale of these entities allows Powin Energy Corporation to turn full focus to Powin Energy and the emerging, high growth energy market.

Industry experts project the energy market to grow an average of 60% per year over the next five years.  During the same five-year period, Powin Energy forecasts securing 4% - 7% of the contracts in that market.   The conservative contract acquisition rate allows Powin Energy to grow at a manageable rate and achieve profitability.  Powin will also continue to pursue strategic investment which will allow for more aggressive growth in future years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,963,027 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5,010,136 used in operating activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease of cash used in operating activities is mainly due to more increase in accounts receivable, more increase in prepaid expenses and deposits, less purchase of inventories, offset by more increased accrued payroll and other liabilities, more increase of accounts payable and more bad debt expense,.

Cash used in investing activities was $74,866 and $119,876 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company acquired less properties and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Cash provided by financing activities were approximately $1,758,884 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,698,428 provided by financing activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease of cash provided from financing activities is due to net proceeds received from stock issuance for Energy.

The Company issued Preferred Stock in August 2015 to settle the following notes payable:

In August 2016, 13,625,826 shares of August 2015 preferred stock had converted into common stock.

The Company s management does not believe the current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs, including cash for working capital and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future. The Company will likely require additional cash resources that will require the Company to sell additional equity securities or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity.

The Company s ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including: investors  perception of, and demand for, securities of alternative manufacturing companies; conditions of the United States and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds; and future results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  Therefore, the Company s management cannot assure that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.  Any failure by the Company s management to raise additional funds on terms favorable to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and financial condition.

27 

On August 8, 2014, Powin Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Powin Energy Corporation (collectively  Powin ) and SF Suntech, Inc. ( Suntech ) signed a Share Subscription Agreement ( Subscription Agreement ) for an investment of $25,000,000 from Suntech.

Effective April 2, 2015, Powin and Suntech signed the Fourth Supplemental Agreement ( Supplement ). Under the Supplement, the First Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement was April 2, 2015 ( First Closing ) at which time Suntech made a payment to Powin in the amount of $7,450,000. That payment plus the previous payments of $3,000,000 on August 29, 2014; $2,000,000 on January 15, 2015 and $50,000 on March 2, 2015 represent a total $12,500,000 paid toward the full $25,000,000 owing under the Subscription Agreement.  On April 1, 2015 and April 2, 2015, Powin Energy issued 1,765 shares and 378 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock to Suntech, respectively.

After the shares issuance, the Company owns 82.35% of Powin Energy.

The Supplement further establishes the Second Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement as May 31, 2015 ( Second Closing ) when the balance of $12,500,000 is to be paid. If that payment is made, Powin will issue to Suntech an additional 2,143 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock.  In the event Suntech is unable or unwilling to pay the remaining subscription balance, Powin will be free to sell the 2,143 shares to another purchaser for the same price per share as paid by Suntech. Suntech failed to make the required payment on May 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has elected to terminate the Subscription Agreement, as it pertains to the remaining $12,500,000 owing thereunder.

On January 2016, the Company paid $15,747 and bought the 15% interest in the company s Mexico subsidiary. The Company now owns 100% of the Mexico subsidiary. As of the purchase date, the non-controlling interest of Mexico amounted to $625,750. The difference of purchase price and balance of non-controlling interest is booked as additional paid in capital.

Subsequent events

Effective October 3, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Powin Industries, SA de CV ( Powin Mexico ) and Rolland Holding Company, LLC ( Rolland )pursuant to which   Company sold to Rolland ninety-nine (99) shares of  the Series A Common Stock and one hundred sixty-seven thousand four hundred fifty-two (167,452) shares of the Series B Common Stock of  Powin Mexico  which represents 99% of the Series A Common Stock and 100% of the Series B Common Stock (collectively the  Shares ) of  Powin Mexico.

At Closing, Rolland made a cash payment of $99,000.00 and delivered to the Company (i) its promissory note in the principal amount $100,000.00 bearing interest at 4% per annum with principal and interest payable in twelve (12) equal monthly installments  ( Short Term Note ) ; and (ii) its promissory note in the principal amount of $800,000.00 bearing interest at 5% per annum with principal and interest payable in ninety-six (96) equal monthly installments  ( Long Term Note ) . The interest rate on the Long Term Note will be renegotiated if and when the Prime Rate for the U.S reaches 5%. In addition, Powin Mexico delivered to the Company a non-interest bearing promissory note in the amount of $125,000.00  ( Powin Mexico Note )  which calls for four (4) equal monthly installments of $31,250.00 on each of December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The Powin Mexico Note represents a compromised amount representing the difference between the amount of the Powin Mexico accounts receivable and the amount of the Powin Mexico accounts payable owing to the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties and representation.  Amounts due under the Short Term Note, the Long Term Note and the Powin Mexico Note, respectively,  may be accelerated upon a failure to pay amounts due thereunder when due, unless waived or cured. As a consequence of the Purchase Agreement, Powin Mexico ceased being a subsidiary of Powin Corporation.

In addition to the sale of the Shares, the Company also transferred and assigned to Cai the Company s right, title and interest in and to the  Huntsman  tradename held by Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing Corporation. 

On October 6, 2016, the merger between Powin Corporation and Powin Energy Corporation became effective, pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and Liquidation dated, (the "Merger Agreement"). Powin Corporation is the surviving entity with a name change to Powin Energy Corporation and will continue to be traded under the stock symbol PWON.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements.  While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical.
