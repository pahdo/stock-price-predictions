1.        Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In the opinion of management, these financial statements and notes reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented.  These statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC. 
  New or Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The update was issued to reduce diversity in practice regarding the presentation of   eight specific types of cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows.  The update is effective for   fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation.    The update simplifies several areas of accounting for share based payments.  The guidance also includes the acceptable or required transition methods for each of the various amendments included in the new standard.  It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases.    The update requires entities to recognize assets and liabilities arising from finance and operating leases and to classify those finance and operating lease payments in the financing or operating sections, respectively, of the statement of cash flows.  It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability.  It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted as of March 26, 2016.  The effect of this accounting change on prior periods was a reclassification of debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015 of   $9.6 million   and   $0.3 million   to  Long-term debt  from  Other assets  and  Prepaid and other current assets,  respectively.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard.  This standard will supersede virtually all current revenue recognition guidance.  The core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations,   ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   and ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    These standards provided guidance on subjects identified as potential implementation issues and will be effective for the Company s first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q filing.  The Company is evaluating the impact of these ASU s on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Subsequent Events 
  Events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date have been evaluated for potential recognition and disclosure through   November 1, 2016  , the date these financial statements were available to be issued.    Two   subsequent events warranting disclosure were identified.  On October 21, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $2.11   per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock for the period from and including August 10, 2016 through November 14, 2016, which will be paid on November 15, 2016 to mandatory convertible preferred stockholders of record as of November 1, 2016.  The board of directors also declared a fourth quarter 2016 cash dividend of   $0.07   per share of common stock.  The common stock dividend is payable on December 30, 2016 to common stockholders of record on December 16, 2016.

2.        Inventory 
  As of   September 24, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s inventory included the following: 

3.        Debt 
  As of   September 24, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s debt consisted of the following: 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company made   $32.7 million   in principal repayments on the term loan facilities.  During the first quarter of   2016  , the Company repurchased in the open market   $43.6 million   of its Senior Notes due   2024   and retired them for   $34.1 million   plus accrued and unpaid interest.  In connection with the retirement of these Senior Notes, the Company recorded a gain in other income of approximately   $8.8 million  , which includes the write-off of   $0.7 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs in the first quarter of 2016.

Principal payments due during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: 

4.        Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents the carrying amount, estimated fair values and categorization under the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments held by the Company at   September 24, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , using market information and what management believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies: 

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: 
  Cash and cash equivalents     The carrying amount is equal to fair market value. 
  Debt     The fair value of fixed-rate debt is based upon quoted market prices for debt with similar terms and maturities.  The variable-rate debt adjusts with changes in the market rate, therefore the carrying value approximates fair value. 

5.        Liabilities for Disposed Operations 
  An analysis of the liabilities for disposed operations for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   is as follows:

Table of Contents  
  Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise stated) 

In addition to the estimated liabilities, the Company is subject to the risk of reasonably possible additional liabilities in excess of the established reserves due to potential changes in circumstances and future events, including, without limitation, changes to current laws and regulations; changes in governmental agency personnel, direction, philosophy and/or enforcement policies; developments in remediation technologies; increases in the cost of remediation, operation, maintenance and monitoring of its disposed operations sites; changes in the volume, nature or extent of contamination to be remediated or monitoring to be undertaken; the outcome of negotiations with governmental agencies and non-governmental parties; and changes in accounting rules or interpretations.  Based on information available as of   September 24, 2016  , the Company estimates this exposure could range up to approximately   $64 million  , although no assurances can be given that this amount will not be exceeded given the factors described above.  These potential additional costs are attributable to several sites and other applicable liabilities.  Further, this estimate excludes reasonably possible liabilities which are not currently estimable primarily due to the factors discussed above. 
  Subject to the previous paragraph, the Company believes established liabilities are sufficient for probable costs expected to be incurred over the next   20 years   with respect to its disposed operations.  However, no assurances are given they will be sufficient for the reasons described above, and additional liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

6.        Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss was comprised of the following: 

(a) 
    These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.  See   Note 12       Employee Benefit Plans   for additional information. 

7.        Preferred Stock    
  Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock 
  On August 4, 2016, the Company completed a registered public offering of   1,725,000   shares of the Company s   8.00%   Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Preferred Stock ), at a public offering price of   $100.00   per share.  Net proceeds were   $166.6 million   after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses.  
  Each share of the Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution and other adjustments, on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be August 15, 2019.  The number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock over a   20   trading day period immediately prior to the mandatory conversion date ( Applicable Market Value ).  If the Applicable Market Value for our common stock is greater than   $15.17   or less than   $12.91  , the conversion rate per share of Preferred Stock will be   6.5923   or   7.7459  , respectively.  If the Applicable Market Value is between   $15.17   and   $12.91  , the conversion rate per share of Preferred Stock will be between   6.5923   and   7.7459  .  Subject to certain restrictions, at any time prior to August 15, 2019, holders of the Preferred Stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common stock at the minimum conversion rate of   6.5923   shares of common stock per share of Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment.

Preferred Stock holders have no voting rights unless dividends on the Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for   six   or more dividend periods.  In those circumstances holders will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of   two   additional members of the Company s board of directors.   
  Dividends Preferred Stock 
  Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis if and when they are declared by our board of directors.  If declared, dividends will be paid at an annual rate of   8.00%   of the liquidation preference of   $100   per share.  Dividend payment dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2016 and ending on August 15, 2019.  Dividends may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.  The terms of the Preferred Stock provide that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Preferred Stock for all prior dividend periods,   no   dividends may be declared or paid on common stock. 

8.        Earnings Per Share of Common Stock 
  The following table provides details of the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share:

9.        Other Operating Expense, Net 
  Other operating expense, net was comprised of the following: 

10.        Income Taxes 
  The Company s effective tax rate for the   third   quarter   2016   was   34.4 percent   compared to   34.2 percent   for the   third   quarter   2015  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 24, 2016   was   35.2 percent   compared to   32.6 percent   for the corresponding   2015   period.  The effective tax rate, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, differs from the federal statutory rate of   35 percent   primarily due to the domestic manufacturing tax deduction, state taxes and nondeductible expenses.  The prior year periods were also unfavorably impacted by an adjustment for state deferred tax rates as a result of a change in a state apportionment factor.   
  The impact of the manufacturing deduction on the effective tax rate is greater in periods that include expenses that reduce pre-tax income but are not currently deductible for income tax purposes.  It is lower in periods that include expenses that reduce taxable income but do not currently reduce pre-tax income.   

11.        Incentive Stock Plans 
  The Company s total stock based compensation cost, for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   $5.0 million   and   $7.3 million  , respectively. 
  The Company also made new grants of restricted and performance shares to certain employees during the first quarter of 2016.  The 2016 restricted share awards vest over   three   or   four   years, depending on the specifics of the grant.  The 2016 performance share awards are measured against an internal return on invested capital target and, depending on performance against the target, the awards will pay out between   0   and   200 percent   of target.  The total number of performance shares earned will be adjusted up or down   25 percent  , for certain participants, based on stock price performance relative to a peer group over the term of the plan, which would result in a final payout range of   0   to   250 percent   of target.

The following table summarizes the activity on the Company s incentive stock awards for the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  : 

12.        Employee Benefit Plans 
  The Company has a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant majority of its employees and an unfunded plan that provides benefits in excess of amounts allowable in the qualified plans under current tax law.  Both the qualified plan and the unfunded excess plan are closed to new participants.  Employee benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial estimates and management assumptions.  These estimates are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events.  Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause the estimates to change. 
  The net pension and postretirement benefit costs that have been recorded are shown in the following tables:

  (Dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise stated) 

On July 27, 2016, the Company made a voluntary contribution of   $10 million   to its pension plan.  The Company does not have any mandatory pension contribution requirements in   2016  . 

13.        Contingencies 
  The Company is engaged in various legal and regulatory actions and proceedings, and has been named as a defendant in various litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  While the Company has procured reasonable and customary insurance covering risks normally occurring in connection with its businesses, the Company has in certain cases retained some risk through the operation of self-insurance, primarily in the areas of workers  compensation, property insurance and general liability.  While there can be no assurance, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

14.        Guarantees 
  The Company provides financial guarantees as required by creditors, insurance programs and various governmental agencies.  As of   September 24, 2016  , the following financial guarantees were outstanding: 

(a) 
    The letters of credit primarily provide credit support for surety bonds issued to comply with financial assurance requirements relating to environmental remediation of disposed sites.  The letters of credit will expire during 2016 and will be renewed as required. 
              (b) 
    The Company purchases surety bonds primarily to comply with financial assurance requirements relating to environmental remediation and post closure care and to provide collateral for the Company s workers  compensation program.  These surety bonds expire at various dates between 2016 and 2019.  They are expected to be renewed annually as required.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

When we refer to  we,   us,   our  or  the Company,  we mean Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  References herein to  Notes to Financial Statements  refer to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. included in Item 1 of this Report. 
  The Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors which may affect future results.  Our MD A should be read in conjunction with our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and information contained in our subsequent Forms 10-Q, 8-K and other reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
  Note About Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ) and adjusted free cash flows.  These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to each of their respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Item 2     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  . 
  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our board of directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  
  We do not consider these non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).  The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they may exclude significant expenses and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management s judgment about which expenses and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, management provides reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon, in whole or part, in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company. 
  Note About Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Rayonier Advanced Materials  future events, developments or financial or operational performance or results, are  forward-looking statements  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   should,   expect,   estimate,   believe,   intend,   anticipate  and other similar language.

Business 
  Rayonier Advanced Materials is a leading manufacturer of high-value cellulose products with production facilities in Jesup, Georgia and Fernandina Beach, Florida.  These products are sold throughout the world for use in various industrial applications and to produce a wide variety of products, including cigarette filters, foods, pharmaceuticals, textiles and electronics. 
  Our primary products consist of the following: 
  Cellulose specialties products   are primarily used in dissolving chemical applications that require a highly purified form of cellulose.  We concentrate on producing the purest, most technologically-demanding forms of cellulose specialties products, such as cellulose acetate and high-purity cellulose ethers, and are a leading supplier of these products.  Typically, though not exclusively, product pricing is set annually in the fourth quarter for the following year based on discussions with customers and the terms of contractual arrangements.  The manufacture and sale of cellulose specialties products are the primary driver of the Company s profitability. 
  Commodity products   are used     for viscose and absorbent materials applications.  Commodity viscose is a raw material required for the manufacture of viscose staple fibers which are used in woven applications such as textiles for clothing and other fabrics, and in non-woven applications such as baby wipes, cosmetic and personal wipes, industrial wipes and mattress ticking.  Absorbent materials, typically referred to as fluff fibers, are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers, feminine hygiene products, incontinence pads, convalescent bed pads, industrial towels and wipes and non-woven fabrics.  Pricing for commodity products is typically referenced to published indices or based on publicly available spot market prices. 
  Industry Update and Outlook 
  For 2016, we continue to expect cellulose specialties prices to decline 6 to 7 percent and cellulose specialties sales volumes to decline   4 to 5 percent   compared to 2015.  Based on contractual commitments for the majority of our acetate volume, 2017 acetate pricing is expected to be approximately 2 percent below 2016.  Negotiations for all cellulose specialties grades for other 2017 volumes will conclude over the next few months, consistent with past practices, and may impact 2017 prices and/or volumes.  Our markets remain challenging as a result of suppressed demand, excess production capacity, and the improved cost position of foreign competitors as a result of weak global currencies relative to the U. S. dollar.  
  During the third quarter, the Company issued $173 million of mandatory convertible preferred stock ( Preferred Stock ) for a net proceeds of approximately $167 million.  We intend to use the funds generated from our Preferred Stock equity issuance to grow and diversify our business.  We will look to invest in our Innovation Initiative through which we are seeking to enhance the value of our current products and engineer new products to extend our market reach, diversify through investments in adjacent businesses and fund potential capital requirements of our Transformation Initiative. 
  Due to the 2016 results of our Transformation Initiative, as well as beneficial raw material prices, we are raising our 2016 guidance.  We expect 2016 net income of   $66   to   $72 million   and are raising pro forma EBITDA guidance to   $215   to   $225 million   from $195 to $205 million.  We expect 2016 operating cash flows of   $210   to   $215 million   and are raising adjusted free cash flows guidance to   $125   to   $130 million   from $100 to $105 million.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately   $85 million  , including a portion of capital for our previously announced lignin joint venture. 
  We have strengthened our culture of continuous improvement allowing us to systematically lower our cost position.  Our success allows us to shift our focus to growing our business through market optimization, innovation and the pursuit of external growth opportunities. 
  Reconciliation of Guided Non-GAAP measures 
  Pro forma EBITDA guidance for 2016 of   $215   to   $225 million   represents expected 2016 net income of   $66   to   $72 million   excluding approximately   $9 million   of pro forma adjustments related to the gain on debt extinguishment as well as estimated

income tax expense, interest expense, net, and depreciation and amortization of   $35   to   $39 million  ,   $35 million  , and   $88 million  , respectively. 
  Adjusted Free Cash Flows Guidance for 2016 of   $125   to   $130 million   represents expected 2016 operating cash flows of   $210   to   $215 million   excluding capital expenditures of   $85 million  . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends, current fact patterns, expectations and other sources of information we believe are reasonable.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  For a full description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations 

14 

Table of Contents  

For the three months ended   September 24, 2016  , total sales decreased   $50 million  , or approximately   19 percent  , primarily due to   8 percent   lower cellulose specialties prices and   13 percent   lower cellulose specialties volumes, as well as, lower commodity volumes.  The decrease in cellulose specialties sales prices and volumes reflected our anticipated declines, from prior year, which were more concentrated in the third quarter.  Commodity volumes were impacted by a change in mix from absorbent materials to commodity viscose and lower production volumes due to an unplanned outage. 

For the   nine   months ended   September 24, 2016  , total sales decreased   $62 million  , or approximately   9 percent  , driven by   7 percent   declines in cellulose specialties sales prices and   5 percent   declines in cellulose specialties volumes.  The decrease in cellulose specialties sales prices and volumes reflected our anticipated declines, from prior year, which were more concentrated in the third quarter.   

(a) 
    Computed based on contribution margin. 
     For the three month period ending   September 24, 2016  , operating income and margin percentage decreased   $17 million  , or 2.8 percentage points, versus the prior year comparable period.  The quarter-to-date results reflect lower cellulose specialties prices and volumes partially offset by lower costs driven primarily by the Transformation Initiative. 

(a) 
    Computed based on contribution margin. 
     For the   nine   month period ending   September 24, 2016  , operating income and margin percentage increased   $22 million  , or 4.7 percentage points, versus the prior year comparable period.  During the year-to-date period, lower cellulose specialties prices and volumes were partially offset by lower costs primarily driven by the Transformation Initiative.  
  Interest Expense, net and Gain on Debt Extinguishment 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased in the open market and retired   $44 million   of our 5.5 percent Senior Notes due 2024 for approximately   $34 million  .  The extinguishment resulted in a gain of about   $9 million  .  We also wrote-off approximately   $1 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished debt. 
  
    15 

Table of Contents  

Interest expense, net of interest income and other expense, was   $8 million   and   $26 million   for the quarter and year-to-date   2016   periods, respectively.  Lower interest expense in 2016 as compared to prior year periods is attributable to lower outstanding debt, including the benefit of the repurchase of our Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher LIBOR interest rates impacting our floating rate debt.  See   Note 3       Debt  . 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Our effective tax rate for the   third   quarter   2016   was   34.4 percent   compared to   34.2 percent   for the   third   quarter   2015  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   35.2 percent   and   32.6 percent  , respectively.  The effective tax rate, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the domestic manufacturing tax deduction, state taxes and nondeductible expenses.  The prior year periods were also unfavorably impacted by an adjustment for state deferred tax rates as a result of a change in a state apportionment factor.  See   Note 10       Income Taxes  . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash flows from operations have historically been our primary source of liquidity and capital resources.  We believe our cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facility, as well as our ability to access the capital markets, if necessary or desirable, will be adequate to fund our operations and anticipated long-term funding requirements, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions and repayment of debt maturities. 
  On October 21, 2016, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   $2.11   per share of Preferred Stock for the period from and including August 10, 2016 through November 14, 2016, which will be paid on November 15, 2016 to Preferred Stock holders of record as of November 1, 2016.  The board of directors also declared a fourth quarter 2016 cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock.  The common stock dividend is payable on December 30, 2016 to common stockholders of record on December 16, 2016. 
  The declaration and payment of future preferred and common stock dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.  In addition, certain of our debt facilities may restrict the declaration and payment of dividends, depending upon our then current compliance with certain covenants. 
  Our debt agreements contain various customary covenants.  At   September 24, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants.  Entities which are non-guarantors under our debt agreements had no assets, revenues, covenant EBITDA or liabilities. 
  A summary of liquidity and capital resources is shown below (in millions of dollars): 

(a) 
    Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, money market deposits and time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Cash Flows (in millions of dollars) 
  The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended: 

Cash provided by operating activities increased $29 million primarily due to improved earnings and working capital and higher deferred taxes, primarily due to accelerated depreciation. 
  Cash used for investing activities decreased $4 million primarily due to reduced capitalized expenditures. 
  Cash used for financing activities increased $152 million primarily due to the issuance of the Preferred Stock partially offset by debt repayments, including the Company s first quarter 2016 repurchase of senior notes.  See   Note 3         Debt     for additional information. 
   
  Performance and Liquidity Indicators 
  The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance, liquidity, ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements.  This information includes the following measures of financial results: EBITDA, pro forma EBITDA and adjusted free cash flows.  These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of EBITDA and adjusted free cash flows is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described above.  Management considers these measures, in addition to operating income, to be important to estimate the enterprise and stockholder values of the Company, and for making strategic and operating decisions.  In addition, analysts, investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing our operating performance, financial condition and cash generating ability.  Management uses EBITDA and pro forma EBITDA as performance measures and adjusted free cash flows as a liquidity measure. 
  EBITDA is defined by SEC rule as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  We define pro forma EBITDA   as EBITDA before non-cash impairment, one-time separation and legal costs, insurance recovery and gain on debt extinguishment.    EBITDA and pro forma EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of results that may be generated in future periods. 
  Below is a reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA for the respective periods (in millions of dollars): 

EBITDA and pro forma EBITDA for the three months ended   September 24, 2016   decreased from the prior year period primarily due to lower gross margin driven by lower prices and volumes for both our cellulose specialties and commodity products.  Lower prices and volumes were partially offset by lower production and selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) costs resulting from the Transformation Initiative. 
  
    17 

Table of Contents  

EBITDA for the nine months ended   September 24, 2016   increased compared to the corresponding 2015 period as lower prices and volumes were more than offset by lower non-cash charges and lower production and SG A costs driven by the Transformation Initiative.  Pro forma EBITDA for the year-to-date period decrease from the prior year period due to lower operating results. 
  We define adjusted free cash flows   as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital expenditures excluding strategic capital.  Adjusted free cash flows is a non-GAAP measure of cash generated during a period which is available for dividend distribution, debt reduction, strategic acquisitions and repurchase of our common stock.  Adjusted free cash flows is not necessarily indicative of the adjusted free cash flows that may be generated in future periods.    
  Below is a reconciliation of cash flows from operations to adjusted free cash flows for the respective periods (in millions of dollars): 

(a) 
    Capital expenditures exclude strategic capital expenditures which are deemed discretionary by management. There have not been any strategic capital expenditures in   2016   or   2015  .  
     Adjusted free cash flows increased over the prior year due to improved earnings, decreases in working capital requirement and lower capital expenditures. 

Contractual Financial Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  See   Note 14       Guarantees   for details on our letters of credit and surety bonds as of   September 24, 2016  . 
  The following table includes material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual financial obligations table as presented in   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Contractual Financial Obligations   of our 2015 Form 10-K.  All items excluded from the table are materially consistent with the Form 10-K presentation.

    Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on outstanding principal amounts and interest rates as of   September 24, 2016  . 
     In addition to the changes noted above, on October 21, 2016, the board of directors declared the first dividend on the Preferred Stock issued in the third quarter of 2016.  For more information on the dividend, see   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Liquidity and Capital Resources   and   Note 1       Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncements  .

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market and Other Economic Risks 
  We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates and commodity prices.  Our objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks.  We may use derivatives in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  Any such derivatives would be managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating, managing and monitoring resulting exposures.  We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  At   September 24, 2016  , we had no derivatives outstanding. 
  Cyclical pricing of commodity market paper pulp is one of the factors which influences prices in the absorbent materials and commodity viscose product lines.  Our cellulose specialties product prices are impacted by market supply and demand, raw material and processing costs, changes in global currencies and other factors.  They are not directly correlated to commodity paper pulp prices.  In addition, a majority of our cellulose specialties products are under long-term volume contracts that extend through 2016 to 2019.  The pricing provisions of these contracts are typically set in the fourth quarter in the year prior to the shipment. 
  As of   September 24, 2016   we had   $286 million   principal amount variable rate debt, which is subject to interest rate risk.  At this borrowing level, a hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase/decrease of approximately $3 million in interest payments and expense over a 12 month period.  Our primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt results from changes in LIBOR. 
  The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk.  However, we intend to hold most of our debt until maturity.  The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt at   September 24, 2016   was   $465 million   compared to the   $506 million   principal amount.  We use quoted market prices to estimate the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.  Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.  A hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in prevailing interest rates at   September 24, 2016   would result in a corresponding decrease/increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of approximately $28 million. 
  We may periodically enter into commodity forward contracts to fix some of our fuel oil and natural gas costs.  Such forward contracts partially mitigate the risk of a change in margins resulting from an increase or decrease in these energy costs.  At   September 24, 2016  , we had no fuel oil or natural gas forward contracts outstanding. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures.  Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )), are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no control evaluation can provide absolute assurance all control exceptions and instances of fraud have been prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance their objectives are achieved. 
  Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 24, 2016  . 
  During the quarter ended   September 24, 2016  , based upon the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of SEC Rule 13a-15, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that would materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. 
    Other Information 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

The Company is engaged in various legal and regulatory actions and proceedings, and has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business.  While the Company has procured reasonable and customary insurance covering risks normally occurring in connection with its businesses, the Company has in certain cases retained some risk through the operation of self-insurance, primarily in the areas of workers  compensation, property insurance and general liability.  Unless specifically noted, any possible range of loss associated with the legal proceedings described below is not reasonably estimable at this time.  While there can be no assurance, the ultimate outcome of these actions, either individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except as may be noted below. 
  Stockholder Litigation 
  On May 4, 2015 the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, captioned   Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System vs. Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc., Paul G. Boynton, Frank A. Ruperto and Benson K. Woo.   An amended consolidated complaint was filed on September 11, 2015 and, subsequently, the case against Mr. Ruperto was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs. The case is a purported class action alleging securities laws violations, primarily related to claims the Company failed to record adequate environmental liabilities related to disposed operations, which the plaintiffs allege led to a decrease in the Company s stock price between June 30, 2014 and January 28, 2015. The allegations are couched as violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, and as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs  amended consolidated complaint in its entirety and, at a hearing on April 20, 2016, the court granted the Company s motion and dismissed the plaintiffs  complaint, but allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to file another amended complaint by a deadline set by the court. The plaintiffs failed to file an amended complaint by the court-imposed deadline and did not appeal the court s April 20 dismissal of the complaint. Pursuant to a stipulation agreed upon by the parties, on July 25, 2016 the court granted final judgment in favor of the Company and all other defendants. No money was paid to the plaintiffs or their counsel in connection with the dismissal of the case and final judgment.  
  Jesup Plant Permit 
  On January 27, 2016, the Altamaha Riverkeeper ( ARK ) filed a Petition for Hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings for the State of Georgia, captioned   Altamaha Riverkeeper, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Division ( EPD ), Georgia Department of Natural Resources  , in which ARK appealed the issuance by EPD to the Company of a new permit for the treatment and discharge of waste water from the Jesup mill, which was to go into effect March 1, 2016.  In the petition, ARK claims, among other things, that the issuance of the permit by EPD would violate Georgia s narrative water quality standard, a rule promulgated by the Georgia Natural Resources Board pursuant to certain provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Georgia Water Quality Control Act.  The petition seeks to have the permit invalidated and modified as demanded by ARK.  On February 16, 2016, the Company moved to legally intervene, as a party-in-interest, in this matter (because EPD, as the permit issuer, is the named defendant) and its petition was granted by the administrative law judge ( ALJ ).  The trial was held in June of 2016, and on September 30 the ALJ issued her decision.  While the court rejected many of ARK s claims, it held that there existed a reasonable potential for the Company s treated effluent discharged to the Altamaha River to cause a violation of Georgia s narrative water quality standard, but only under low (rather than  normal ) river flow conditions. As such, the court reversed the issuance of the new permit by EPD and remanded the matter back to EPD for consideration and issuance of a permit that comports with the ruling. The Company strongly disagrees with the decision and is currently evaluating its legal and other options, and has appealed the ruling to Georgia Superior Court.  EPD has also separately appealed the ruling.  Until final resolution of this litigation, the Jesup plant will continue to operate under its existing waste water permit.  
  SEC Inquiry 
  On June 21, 2016, the Company received a letter from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in which it requested the Company voluntarily provide to it documents and correspondence with environmental regulators concerning certain former operations of the Company.  These documents were requested following the Company s response to comments from SEC staff regarding certain environmental reserves taken by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the disclosures made by the Company in connection therewith. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in its request.  No enforcement action has been brought by the SEC to date and it is unknown whether any such action will be brought in the future.  The Company believes that its reserves and disclosures were appropriate and in compliance with applicable accounting rules and law.

  I, Paul G. Boynton, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
