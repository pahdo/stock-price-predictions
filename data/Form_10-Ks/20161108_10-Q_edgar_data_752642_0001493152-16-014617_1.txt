NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

UMH
Properties, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  us  or  the Company ) owns and operates one hundred
manufactured home communities containing approximately 18,000 developed home sites as of September 30, 2016. These communities
are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana and Michigan. The Company, through its wholly-owned
taxable subsidiary, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. ( S F ), conducts manufactured home sales in its communities.
S F was established to enhance the occupancy of the communities. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include
S F and all of its other wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company also invests in securities of other Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs ) which the Company generally
limits to no more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets.  

The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ), and intends
to maintain its qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, the Company will not be taxed
under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders.
For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. The Company is subject to franchise taxes
in some of the states in which the Company owns property.  

The
interim Consolidated Financial Statements furnished herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information, the instructions
to Form 10-Q, and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For
further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Use
of Estimates    

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the
consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.  

Reclassifications

Certain
amounts in the financial statements for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the statement presentation for
the current periods.  

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities     

In
the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on its variable
rate debt. The Company attempts to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies,
including the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts
is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows. The Company generally employs
derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company does not enter
into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements that
have had the effect of fixing interest rates relative to specific mortgage loans.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement that has the effect of fixing interest rates relative to
a specific mortgage loan as follows:  

The
Company s interest rate swap agreement is based upon 30-day LIBOR. The re-pricing and scheduled maturity dates, payment
dates, index and the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreement coincides with those of the underlying mortgage. The
interest rate swap agreement is net settled monthly. The Company has designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge and has recorded
the fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (See Note 8 for information on the determination
of fair value). The effective portion of the gain or loss on this hedge will be reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that the hedging relationship is not effective or does not qualify
as a cash flow hedge, the ineffective portion is recorded in Interest Expense. Hedges that received designated hedge accounting
treatment are evaluated for effectiveness at the time that they are designated as well as through the hedging period. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has determined that this interest rate swap agreement is highly effective as a cash
flow hedge. As a result, the fair value of these derivatives of $(17,155) and $(1,700), respectively, was recorded as a component
of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), with the corresponding liability included in Accrued Liabilities and Deposits.  

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    

In
September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  ASU 2015-16
eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires
that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting
period in which the adjustment is identified. In addition, separate presentation on the face of the income statement or disclosure
in the notes is required regarding the portion of the adjustment recorded in the current period earnings, by line item, that would
have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition
date. ASU 2015-16 is to be applied prospectively for measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date. The Company
adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  ASU 2015-15 expands guidance provided in ASU 2015-03 and states that presentation
of costs associated with securing a revolving line of credit as an asset is permitted, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding.
The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2016. This adoption resulted in the reclassification of deferred debt
issuance costs of $3,711,591 from other assets ($3,587,294 to mortgages payable and $124,297 to loans payable) in our December
31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassification of amortization of financing costs of $141,592 and $407,481 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).  

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. 
ASU 2015-02 focuses to minimize situations under previously existing guidance in which a reporting entity was required to consolidate
another legal entity in which that reporting entity did not have: (1) the ability through contractual rights to act primarily
on its own behalf; (2) ownership of the majority of the legal entity s voting rights; or (3) the exposure to a majority
of the legal entity s economic benefits. ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.
The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, and it did not have a material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.  

Other
Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and
classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting
periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the potential impact this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 requires that entities use a new forward looking  expected loss 
model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit
losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability
of the reported amount. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within
those periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have
on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory
tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting
periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease
accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor
accounting. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after,
the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity
method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of
financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by
measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the
method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments
measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within
those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory
that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the
scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the
ordinary course of business, less reasonable predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in ASU
2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting
Standards ( IFRS ). ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

NOTE
2   NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE    

Basic
Net Income (Loss) per Share is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding plus the weighted average number of net shares that would be issued upon exercise of stock options pursuant to the
treasury stock method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, employee stock options to purchase 1,900,500 shares
of common stock were excluded from the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, employee stock options to purchase 1,563,000 shares of common stock were
excluded from the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  

NOTE
3   INVESTMENT PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

On
September 1, 2016, the Company acquired two manufactured home communities located in Ohio for approximately $2,954,000. These
all-age communities contain a total of 165 developed homesites that are situated on approximately 71 total acres. At the date
of acquisition, the average occupancy for these communities was approximately 64%.  

These
acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations,
and accordingly, the results of the acquired assets are included in the statements of income (loss) from the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
allocations of the fair value of the assets acquired are subject to further adjustment as final costs and valuations are determined.  

See
Note 12 for the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information relating to these acquisitions.  

NOTE
4   SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE   

The
Company s Securities Available for Sale at Fair Value consists primarily of marketable common and preferred stock of other
REITs with a fair value of $111,046,262 as of September 30, 2016. The Company generally limits its investment in marketable securities
to no more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional
liquidity and additional income and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold securities with a cost basis of $10,431,184 and recognized a Gain on
Sale of $1,898,836. The Company also made purchases of $23,453,933 in Securities Available for Sale. Of this amount, the Company
made total purchases of 86,050 common shares of Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation ( MREIC ), a related REIT,
through MREIC s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan for a total cost of $1,023,326 or weighted average cost of
$11.89 per share. The Company owned a total of 2,211,321 MREIC common shares as of September 30, 2016 at a total cost of $18,878,380
and a fair value of $31,555,547.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had total net unrealized gains of $20,957,227 in its REIT securities portfolio. The Company
held two securities that had unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016. The Company considers many factors in determining whether
a security is other than temporarily impaired, including the nature of the security and the cause, severity and duration of the
impairment. The Company normally holds REIT securities long-term and has the ability and intent to hold these securities to recovery.  

The
following is a summary of the securities that the Company has determined to be temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016:  

The
following is a summary of the range of the losses on these temporarily impaired securities:  

NOTE
5   LOANS AND MORTGAGES PAYABLE   

On
January 7, 2016, the Company obtained a $7,200,000 mortgage loan on Woods Edge from OceanFirst Bank. This mortgage is at a fixed
rate of 4.3% and matures on January 7, 2026. The interest rate will be reset after five years to the rate the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York charges to its members plus 2.5%.   

On
May 2, 2016, the Company obtained a $4,760,000 Freddie Mac mortgage through Wells Fargo on Waterfalls Village with an interest
rate that is fixed at 4.38%. The Company also obtained a $3,498,000 Freddie Mac mortgage through Wells Fargo on Valley Hills with
an interest rate that is fixed at 4.32%. These mortgages mature on June 1, 2026, with principal repayments based on a 30-year
amortization schedule. Proceeds from these mortgages were used to repay existing mortgages on three communities with an average

NOTE
7   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   

The
Company accounts for awards of stock options and restricted stock in accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation.
ASC 718-10 requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and amortized over the service period (generally
equal to the vesting period). The compensation cost for stock option grants is determined using option pricing models, intended
to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date less estimated forfeitures. The compensation expense for restricted
stock is recognized based on the fair value of the restricted stock awards less estimated forfeitures. The fair value of restricted
stock awards is equal to the fair value of the Company s stock on the grant date. Compensation costs of $419,746 and $896,519
have been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $203,549 and $657,230 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

On
April 5, 2016, the Company awarded a total of 40,500 shares of restricted stock to Samuel A. Landy and Anna T. Chew, pursuant
to their employment agreements. The fair value on the grant date of these restricted stock grants was $395,685. These grants vest
ratably over 5 years.  

On
April 5, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 527,000 shares of common stock to thirty-four participants in the Company s
2013 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan. The fair value on the grant date of these options amounted to $424,556. These grants vest
over one year. Compensation costs for grants issued to a participant who is of retirement age is recognized at the time of the
grant.  

On
September 14, 2016, the Company awarded 20,000 shares of restricted stock to Eugene W. Landy. The fair value on the grant date
of these restricted stock grants was $231,400 and since Mr. Landy is of retirement age, the entire compensation cost was recognized
at the time of the grant. These grants vest ratably over 5 years.  

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
weighted-average fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.81 and $0.93 per
share, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there were options outstanding to purchase 1,900,500 shares. There were 1,235,500 shares available for
grant under the 2013 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, eleven participants exercised
options to purchase a total of 137,000 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $7.89 per share for total
proceeds of $1,081,380. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, options to one participant to purchase a total of 50,000
shares expired. As of September 30, 2015, there were options outstanding to purchase 1,563,000 shares and 1,832,000 shares were
available for grant under the Company s 2013 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan. The aggregate intrinsic value of options
outstanding as of September 30, 2016 was $2,562,973 and the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $487,610.  

NOTE
8 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

In
accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value on a recurring basis, including Securities Available for Sale. The fair value of these financial assets and liabilities
was determined using the following inputs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(1)   
      Included
    in accrued liabilities and deposits   

In
addition to the Company s investments in securities available for sale and interest rate swaps, the Company is required
to disclose certain information about the fair values of its other financial instruments, as defined in ASC 825-10, Financial
Instruments. Estimates of fair value are made at a specific point in time, based upon, where available, relevant market prices
and information about the financial instrument. Such estimates do not include any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. All of the Company s Securities
Available for Sale have quoted market prices and are therefore classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. A quoted market
price is indirectly available for our interest rate swap. This price is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows, and reflects the contractual terms of the derivative, including
the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs. As such, we have determined that the valuation of this interest
rate swap is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The
fair value of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Notes Receivable approximates their current carrying amounts since all such items
are short-term in nature. The fair value of variable rate Mortgages Payable and Loans Payable approximate their current carrying
amounts since such amounts payable are at approximately a weighted-average current market rate of interest. As of September 30,
2016, the fair value of Fixed Rate Mortgages Payable amounted to $276,010,009 and the carrying value of Fixed Rate Mortgages Payable
amounted to $277,205,883. The fair value of fixed rate Mortgages Payable is estimated based upon discounted cash flows at current
market rates for instruments with similar remaining terms.   

NOTE
9   CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS   

From
time to time, the Company may be subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe
that any such claims or litigation will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations.  

Included
in the Company s Community Operating Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is $125,000 for the settlement
of the Memphis Mobile City lawsuit. The Company is in the process of constructing a new manufactured home community at this location,
which is expected to cost approximately $5.4 million, of which approximately $1.7 million has been incurred as of September 30,
2016. Once fully developed, the community will contain a total of 134 developed homesites.   

The
Company has an agreement with 21st Mortgage Corporation ( 21st Mortgage ) under which 21st Mortgage can provide financing
for home purchasers in the Company s communities. The Company does not receive referral fees or other cash compensation
under the agreement. If 21st Mortgage makes loans to purchasers and those purchasers default on their loans and 21st Mortgage
repossesses the homes securing such loans, the Company has agreed to purchase from 21st Mortgage each such repossessed home for
a price equal to 80% to 95% of the amount under each such loan, subject to certain adjustments. This agreement may be terminated
by either party with 30 days written notice. As of September 30, 2016, the total loan balance under this agreement was approximately
$5 million. Additionally, 21st Mortgage previously made loans to purchasers in certain communities we acquired. In conjunction
with these acquisitions, the Company has agreed to purchase from 21st Mortgage each repossessed home, if those purchasers default
on their loans. The purchase price ranges from 55% to 100% of the amount under each such loan, subject to certain adjustments.
As of September 30, 2016, the total loan balance owed to 21st Mortgage with respect to homes in these acquired communities was
approximately $5 million.  

The
Company entered into a Chattel Loan Origination, Sale and Servicing Agreement ( COP Program ) with Triad Financial
Services, effective January 1, 2016. The Company does not receive referral fees or other cash compensation under the agreement.
Customer loan applications are initially submitted to Triad for consideration by Triad s portfolio of outside lenders. If
the loan application does not meet the criteria for outside financing, the application is then considered for financing under
the COP Program. If the loan is approved under the COP Program, then it is originated by Triad and subsequently purchased by the
Company. Included in Notes and Other Receivables is approximately $2,923,000 of loans that the Company purchased from the COP
Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview   

The following discussion
and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included elsewhere herein and in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company is a self-administered,
self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) with headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. The Company s primary
business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an
annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through
its taxable REIT subsidiary, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. ( S F ), sells and finances homes to qualified residents
and prospective residents of our communities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned one hundred manufactured home communities
containing approximately 18,000 developed home sites. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Indiana and Michigan. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no
more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets. 

The Company earns income
from the leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes, and the
brokering of home sales, from investments in marketable REIT securities, and from appreciation in the values of the manufactured
home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. The Company believes that its capital structure, which allows for the ownership
of assets using a balanced combination of equity obtained through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and debt, will
enhance shareholder returns as the properties appreciate over time. Our sales operations, which had been negatively affected by
the limited ability of homebuyers to qualify for loans to purchase homes, have improved. 

Manufactured home rentals
in land lease communities has, over the last several years, proven to be the best way to pass the lower housing costs manufactured
homes provide to consumers who desire quality affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. We have
added an additional 715 rental homes during the first nine months of 2016, bringing the total to approximately 4,400 rental homes.
Occupied rental homes represent approximately 28.8% of total occupied sites at quarter end. Occupancy in rental homes continues
to be strong and is at 93.5% as of September 30, 2016. We anticipate adding a total of over 800 rental homes in 2016, as the market
dictates. 

The Company intends to
continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our
cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. This has
resulted in increased occupancy rates and improved operating results. Community Net Operating Income ( NOI ) increased
32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the prior year period. Same property occupancy, which includes communities
owned and operated as of January 1, 2015, increased by 200 basis points to 84.9% over the prior year period and same property NOI
increased 23.1% over the prior year period. We have been positioning ourselves for future growth and will continue to seek opportunistic
investments. There is no assurance that the Company can continue to buy existing manufactured home communities that meet the requirements
of the business plan or that the demand for rental homes will continue in the future. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company acquired seven all-age communities containing 1,520 sites for an aggregate purchase price
of $45,117,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired two all-age communities in Ohio, Lakeview
Meadows and Wayside, containing a total of 165 homesites on 71 acres for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,954,000.
The weighted average occupancy for these two communities was approximately 64%. These communities are part of a five community
portfolio, all located in Ohio, containing a total of 821 homesites, with a total purchase price of $17,020,000. The acquisition
of the remaining communities is expected to close before year-end. The completion of this acquisition is subject to due diligence
and other customary closing conditions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that this acquisition will take place during 2016
or at all. 

To help fund our growth,
on April 5, 2016, the Company issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred stock at a sale price of $25.50 per share.
The Company received net proceeds from the offering after expenses of approximately $49.1 million. 

See PART I, Item 1  
Business in the Company s 2015 annual report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide
factors relevant to the Company and the opportunities and challenges, and risks on which the Company is focused. 

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The discussion and analysis
of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of Assets and Liabilities, Revenues and Expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
Assets and Liabilities at the date of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

On a regular basis, management
evaluates our assumptions, judgments and estimates. Management believes there have been no material changes to the items that we
disclosed as our significant accounting policies and estimates under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Supplemental Measures   

In addition to the results
reported in accordance with GAAP, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include
certain non-GAAP financial measures that in management s view of the business we believe are meaningful as they allow the
investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions
or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-GAAP financial measures as
determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include
Community NOI, Funds From Operations ( FFO ), Core Funds From Operations ( Core FFO ) and Normalized Funds
From Operations ( Normalized FFO ). A discussion of FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO, and a reconciliation to net income
is included in the presentation of FFO included in Item 2 of this Form 10Q. 

We define Community NOI
as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries,
utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure
of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not
be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as
an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor
is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. 

The Company s Community
NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is calculated as follows: 

Changes In Results Of Operations   

Rental and Related Income
increased 22% from $18,970,407 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $23,103,155 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. Rental and Related Income increased 24% from $54,123,435 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $67,313,211
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the acquisitions made during 2015 and 2016,
as well as increases in rental rates, same property occupancy and rental homes. The Company has been raising rental rates by approximately
2% to 6% annually at most communities. Same property occupancy has increased 200 basis points from 82.9% as of September 30, 2015
to 84.9% at quarter-end. Occupied rental homes increased 35% from approximately 3,100 homes at September 30, 2015 to 4,200 homes
at September 30, 2016. 

Community Operating Expenses
increased 15% from $9,337,742 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $10,719,289 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. Community Operating Expenses increased 17% from $27,289,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $31,993,965
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the acquisitions made during 2015 and 2016. 

Community NOI increased
29% from $9,632,665 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $12,383,866 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
Community NOI increased 32% from $26,833,665 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $35,319,246 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the acquisitions during 2015 and 2016 and increases in rental rates,
occupancy and rental homes. 

The Company has also been
reducing its Operating Expense Ratio (defined as Community Operating Expenses divided by Rental and Related Income). Our Operating
Expense Ratio improved from 49.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 46.4% for the three months ended September 30,
2016, and from 50.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 47.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Many recently
acquired communities had substantial deferred maintenance costs, requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years
of ownership. During the current period, these deferred maintenance costs have been reduced, resulting in the Operating Expense
Ratio decreasing as well. In addition, most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs and therefore, as occupancy rates
continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material
effect on revenues and income from continuing operations due to the Company s ability to periodically adjust its rental rates. 

Sales of manufactured
homes decreased 17% from $2,724,592, or 45 homes, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,251,896, or 42 homes, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. Sales of manufactured homes increased 24% from $5,469,093 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $6,756,921 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company has seen a 31% increase in the number
of homes sold to 132 homes sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 101 homes sold for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales of manufactured homes amounted to $1,803,315 and $2,089,602 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes amounted to $5,278,587 and $4,209,126 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gross profit percentage was 20% and 23% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gross profit percentage was 22% and 23% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling expenses, which includes salaries, commissions, advertising and other miscellaneous expenses,
amounted to $812,392 and $798,126 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although the number of
homes sold increased 31%, selling expenses only increased 6% and amounted to $2,270,861 and $2,141,693 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Loss from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of
sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) amounted to $515,720 or 23% of total
sales and $395,878 or 15% of total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Loss from the sales
operations amounted to $1,308,765 or 19% of total sales and $1,429,261 or 26% of total sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Many of the costs associated with sales, such as salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion,
are fixed. The Company continues to be confident about increasing future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need
for affordable housing in its markets. 

The U.S. homeownership
rate was 63.5% in the third quarter of 2016, according to the U.S. Census. This is down from 69.2% at its peak at the end of 2004.
The macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. Rental homes in a manufactured
home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for
less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. The Company remains very focused on increasing this aspect of our business.
Nevertheless, the Company believes that the sale of new homes produces new rental revenue and is an investment in the upgrading
of the communities. 

General and Administrative
Expenses increased 27% from $1,799,181 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,293,366 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. General and Administrative Expenses increased 13% from $5,264,839 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $5,933,299
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel and the issuance of
restricted stock to one employee of retirement age. The entire compensation cost of $231,400 for this employee was recognized at
the time of grant. 

Depreciation Expense increased
23% from $4,786,090 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $5,887,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
Depreciation Expense increased 27% from $13,465,559 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $17,092,676 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2015 and
2016. 

Interest Income decreased
9% from $442,600 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $400,899 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Interest
Income decreased 13% from $1,387,062 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,206,858 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of notes receivable. The average balance at September
30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $18.4 million and $20.0 million, respectively. 

Dividend Income increased
57% from $1,121,274 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,755,438 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
Dividend Income increased 50% from $3,222,928 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $4,834,817 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the increase in the average balance of Securities Available for Sale
from $62.5 million at September 30, 2015 to $93.0 million at September 30, 2016. The dividends received from our securities investments
were at a weighted average yield of approximately 6.5% and 7.6% at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and continue to meet
our expectations. It is the Company s intent to hold these securities long-term. 

The Company recognized
a Gain on Sale of Securities Transactions of $884,458 and $47,671 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company recognized a Gain on Sale of Securities Transactions of $1,898,836 and $127,419 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, the Company s unrealized holding gains (losses) on its investment in securities
increased from an unrealized loss of $(2,055,026) as of December 31, 2015 to an unrealized gain of $20,957,227 as of September
30, 2016, resulting in an increase in value of the securities portfolio for the nine months of $23,012,253. 

Interest Expense increased
9% from $3,450,914 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3,774,341 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Interest
Expense increased 19% from $9,766,523 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $11,604,123 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to an increase in the average balance of mortgages and loans payable due to the new
community acquisitions in 2015, as well as additional community financings/re-financings in 2015 and 2016. The average balance
at September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $341.3 million and $297.6 million, respectively. The weighted average interest
rate was 4.3% and 4.4% at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Changes in Financial Condition   

Total Investment Property
and Equipment increased 8% or $45,881,002 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company purchased two communities
and added 715 rental homes to its existing communities. The Company s occupancy rate on its  rental homes portfolio
increased 60 basis points and was 93.5% at September 30, 2016 as compared to 92.9% at December 31, 2015. 

Securities Available for
Sale increased 48% or $36,035,002 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due to purchases of $23,453,933,
a change in the unrealized gain (loss) from an unrealized loss of $(2,055,026) as of December 31, 2015 to an unrealized gain of
$20,957,227 as of September 30, 2016, resulting in an increase for the nine months of $23,012,253, offset by sales with a cost
basis of $10,431,184, which resulted in realized gains totaling $1,898,836. 

Mortgages Payable increased
1% or $1,970,763 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was due to obtaining new mortgages of approximately
$15.5 million, partially offset by principal and balloon repayments of approximately $13.6 million. 

Loans Payable decreased
2% or $1,282,870 during the nine months September 30, 2016. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease of $6.0 million on our
revolving line of credit for the finance of home sales and a decrease of $1.2 million on our revolving credit facilities for the
purchase of inventory, partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million on our unsecured line of credit and an increase of $900,000
on our margin loan and other loans payable. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The Company s principal
liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company s stockholders,
acquisitions, capital improvements, development and expansions of properties, debt service, purchases of manufactured home inventory
and rental homes, investment in marketable securities of other REITs, financing of manufactured home sales and payments of expenses
relating to real estate operations. We anticipate that the liquidity demands of the recent properties acquired will be met by the
operations of these acquisitions. The Company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet these demands is dependent primarily
on income from its real estate investments and securities portfolio, the sale of real estate investments and securities, refinancing
of mortgage debt, leveraging of real estate investments, availability of bank borrowings, lines of credit, proceeds from the DRIP,
and access to the capital markets. 

In addition to cash generated
through operations, the Company uses a variety of sources to fund its cash needs, including acquisitions. The Company intends to
continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our
cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. There is
no guarantee that any of these additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of
such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company s
investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant. To
fund these acquisitions, the Company may sell marketable securities, borrow on its lines of credit, finance and refinance its properties,
and/or raise capital through the DRIP and capital markets. To the extent that funds or appropriate communities are not available,
fewer acquisitions will be made. 

The Company raised $11,006,722
from the issuance of common stock in the DRIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included Dividend Reinvestments
of $1,738,947. Dividends paid on the common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $14,814,113, of which $1,738,947
were reinvested. Dividends paid on the Series A Preferred shares and the Series B Preferred shares for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 totaled $10,773,898. 

On April 5, 2016, the Company
issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of new Series B Preferred stock in a registered direct placement at a sale price of $25.50 per
share. The Company received net proceeds from the offering after expenses of approximately $49.1 million and used the net proceeds
for general corporate purposes, which included purchase of manufactured homes for sale or lease to customers, expansion of its
existing communities, acquisitions of additional properties and repayment of indebtedness on a short-term basis. 

Net Cash provided by Operating
Activities amounted to $21,403,450 and $14,008,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had Cash and Cash Equivalents of $3.7 million, Securities Available for Sale of $111.0 million, encumbered
by $16.5 million in margin loans, $15.0 million available on its unsecured credit facility, with an additional $15 million potentially
available pursuant to an accordion feature, $6.0 million available on its revolving line of credit for the financing of home sales
and approximately $11.6 million available on its revolving credit facilities for the financing of inventory purchases. The Company
owns 100 communities, of which 25 are unencumbered. These marketable securities, non-mortgaged properties, and lines of credit
provide the Company with additional liquidity. The Company has been raising capital through its DRIP and through public offerings
and registered direct placements of its preferred stock. 

The Company believes that
funds generated will be adequate to meet its obligations over the next several years. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Funds From Operations   

We also assess and measure
our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations ( FFO ),
which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as
a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
( NAREIT ), represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), excluding extraordinary items, as defined under U.S. GAAP,
gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate
assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP
supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core Funds From Operations ( Core FFO ), as FFO plus
acquisition costs and cost of early extinguishment of debt. We define Normalized Funds From Operations ( Normalized FFO ),
as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on securities investments and certain one-time charges. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized
FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude
historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. However,
other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO and, accordingly, our FFO, Core FFO and
Normalized FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are significant
components in understanding the Company s financial performance. 

FFO, Core FFO and Normalized
FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as alternatives to net
income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii)
are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. 

The reconciliation of the
Company s U.S. GAAP Net Income (Loss) to the Company s FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are calculated as follows: 

(1)
      
      Included
    in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).   

(2)
      
      Included
    in Community Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).   

The following are the cash
flows provided (used) by operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:
