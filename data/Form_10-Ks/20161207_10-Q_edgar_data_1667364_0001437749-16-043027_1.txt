  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016   

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
   Nature of Operations      
     
  Opportunity Acquis Corp. (" Opportunity " or "the  Company ") was incorporated on September 17, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the start-up stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to conducting a private placement of its shares of common stock (see Note 3) and seeking target companies with which to form a business combination. The Company is attempting to identify, locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most anticipated instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. Such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (" GAAP ") in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.   
     
  The unaudited interim condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by Opportunity Acquis Corp. (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). We suggest that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10 for the period ended April 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC. We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in Form 10 have been omitted  

The Company s fiscal year end is April 30.  
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   

5

Cash    
     
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents and had $24,178 in cash as of April 30, 2016 and $18,416 as of October 31, 2016.   
     
    Concentration of Risk    
     
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with an FDIC insured banking institution. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of October 31, 2016.   
     
    Income Taxes    
     
  Under ASC 740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of October 31, 2016 there were no deferred income taxes or benefits due to the Company s uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.   
     
     Loss Per Common Share    
     
  Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity. As of April 30, 2016 and October 31, 2016, there were no outstanding dilutive securities.   
     
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
     
  The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).   
     
  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.   
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  On June 12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10 Technical Corrections and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-240  Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.

On May 21, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-09 Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts. The objectives of the amendments in this Update are to increase transparency of significant estimates made in measuring the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, improve comparability through consistently disclosed information, and provide financial statements users with information to facilitate analysis of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from contracts issued by insurance entities and the development of loss reserve estimates. For public business entities, effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. For all other entities, effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
  On May 12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-08 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting: Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 115. This Accounting Standards Update amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 115. The amendments are effective upon issuance (May 12, 2015). Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
  On May 1, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-07 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. Currently, investments valued using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy on the basis of whether the investment is redeemable with the investee at net asset value on the measurement date, never redeemable with the investee at net asset value, or redeemable with the investee at net asset value at a future date. To address the diversity in practice related to how certain investments measured at net asset value with future redemption dates are categorized, the amendments in this Update remove the requirement to categorize investments for which fair values are measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. It also limits disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using the practical expedient. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update EITF-14B Fair Value Measurement  Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (Topic 820), which has been deleted. Effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective approach requires that an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entity s financial statements. Earlier application is permitted. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
  On April 30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06  Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the two-class method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights holders each participate differently in the distribution of available cash. When a general partner transfers (or  drops down ) net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, the statements of operations of the master limited partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the entities were under common control. The amendments in this Update specify that for purposes of calculating historical EPU under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner interest, and previously reported EPU of the limited partners would not change as a result of a dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs also are required. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update EITF-14A Earnings Per Share Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions (Topic 260), which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.

On April 15, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-05 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to address the concerns of stakeholders that the lack of guidance about a customer s accounting for fees in a cloud computing arrangement leads to unnecessary cost and complexity when evaluating the accounting for those fees, as well as some diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-230 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), which has been deleted. Effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
  On April 15, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-04  Compensation  Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets. The amendments in this Update would provide a practical expedient for employers with fiscal year-ends that do not fall on a month-end by permitting those employers to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-260 Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which has been deleted. Effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application is permitted. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
  On April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update would require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs would not be affected by the amendments in this Update. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-250 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), which has been deleted. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.  
     
  On February 18, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities; (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2011-220 Consolidation (Topic 810), which has been deleted. Effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this Update using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.

In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. The objective of this Update is to simplify the income statement presentation requirements in Subtopic 225-20 by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. Extraordinary items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence. Eliminating the extraordinary classification simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-220 Income Statement Extraordinary Items (Subtopic 225-20), which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.   
     
   NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN   
     
  The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating losses during the period ended October 31, 2016. The Company had working capital of $18,416 and an accumulated deficit of $9,584 as of October 31, 2016. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required.   
     
  The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs significantly beyond one year except with extremely limited operations. The Company will engage in extremely limited activities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company may offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations dependent upon the length of time the cash raised through the private offering conducted since inception through October 31, 2016 is adequate to meet the Company s financial obligations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.     
     
  For the period from September 17, 2015 (inception) to April 30, 2016 and for the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss and accumulated deficit of $4,022 and $9,584 respectively, no cash flow from operating activities, and no working capital deficit. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Item 2.      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Results of Operations    
     
   Since inception in 2015   
     
  The Company was formed on September 17, 2015 and since that time has been in the start-up stage wherein it raised a total of $28,000 in a private placement which commenced October 2015. The Company is a blank check company and qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Company has incurred expenses of $4,013 for the six months ended October 31, 2016, consisting entirely of general and administrative expenses related to its limited operations.   
     
  As of the end of the Company s fiscal year, April 30, 2016 and the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations. For the six month period ending October 31, 2016, the Company had sustained a net loss of $5,762.  
     
  The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any revenue generating activities. The Company has neither generated revenues nor received income, has had no operations other than to form a corporation and to raise a limited amount of capital pursuant to a private placement. It has incurred and paid various state fees and expenses related to such activities, engaged its accountants to audit and review its books and records in order to prepare the Company's financial statements and paid filing fees.  
     
  The Company is seeking an Acquisition candidate in order to pursue its business objectives. An Acquisition will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or a tax free stock-for-assets exchange. As of the date of this filing, there have been some companies (target entities) that have been in contact with the Company for such purpose. No assurance is given that the Company will be successful in identifying, locating, negotiating, or consummating an Acquisition. No assurance can be given that the funds held by the Company will be sufficient to finance the operations of any as of yet unknown and unidentified Acquisition candidates.   
     
  The Company has authorized a total of 525,000,000 shares of capital stock which includes 500,000,000 shares authorized as common stock for issuance. The Company issued 21,000,000 shares of common stock as a result of its private placement, 200,000 shares of common stock for services, and 70,000,000 shares of common stock to two of its Officers upon its founding. There are a total 91,200,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.   
     
  The Company s capital stock also includes 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance; none of the preferred Stock have been classified, designated or issued.   
        
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
  The Company, as of October 31, 2016 had limited working capital, consisting of $18,416 of cash on hand. Dependent upon the Acquisition candidate that completes a transaction with the Company and its financial resources, additional financing may be necessary to be raised for the Company to carry-out its then new business objectives, and may further dilute the holdings of all of the current shareholders. In addition, the funds on hand may prove to be insufficient to permit the Company to locate assets and/or a business to acquire. There is no assurance the Company will be able to succeed in its intended business activities due to its limited capital availability.   

11

Cash used in operating activities for the six month period ended October 31, 2016 consisted of a net loss of $5,762.   
     
  No cash was provided from financing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and $28,000 was received in the period from inception (September 17, 2015) through the year ended April 30, 2016.  
     
    Considerations regarding Forward-Looking Disclosures  .
