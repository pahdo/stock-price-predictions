Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan
of Operation:  

Sino-American was organized on February 9, 2009, as a blank check
or shell company under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that
provide cash flow. From inception, the primary activity of the Company has been directed towards organizational efforts, compliance
matters and locating potential merger or acquisition candidates. 

The Company has registered its Common Stock on a Form 10 registration
statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission periodic reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. 

The Company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition
of an unidentified private company, which desires to become a reporting (public) company whose securities are qualified for trading
in the United States secondary market. The Company meets the definition of a blank check company contained in Section 7(b)(3) of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

The Company believes that there are perceived benefits to being
a reporting company with a class of publicly-traded securities which may be attractive to foreign and domestic private companies. 

These benefits are commonly thought to include: 

1. the ability to use registered shares to make acquisition of
assets or businesses; 

2. increased visibility in the financial community; 

3. the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; 

4. improved trading efficiency; 

5. shareholder liquidity; 

6. greater ease in subsequently raising capital; 

7. compensation of key employees through options for stock for
which there is a public market; 

8. enhanced corporate image; and, 

9. a presence in the United States capital market. 

A private company, which may be interested in a business combination
with the Company, may include the following: 

1. a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is
the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses; 

2. a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities
or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; 

3. a company which wishes to become public with less dilution
of its Common Stock than would occur normally upon an underwriting; 

4. a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment
capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; 

5. a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the
United States securities market; 

6. a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public
market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan; and, 

7. a company seeking one or more of the other benefits believed
to attach to a public company. 

The Company is authorized to enter into a definitive agreement
with a wide variety of private businesses without limitation as to their industry or revenues. It is not possible at this time
to predict with which private company, if any, the Company will enter into a definitive agreement or what will be the industry,
operating history, revenues, future prospects or other characteristics of that company. 

As of the date hereof, management of the Company has not made
any final decision for a business combination with any private corporations, partnerships or sole proprietorships. When any such
agreement is reached or other material fact occurs, the Company will file notice of such agreement or fact with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K. Persons reading this Financial Statement are advised to see if the Company has subsequently
filed a Form 8-K. 

There is presently no trading market for the Company's common
stock and no market may ever exist for the Company's common stock. The Company plans to apply for a corporate CUSIP # for its common
stock and to assist broker-dealers in complying with Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that such
brokers can quote the price of the Company's common stock in the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (the  OTC Bulletin Board 
or  OTCBB ) after the Company is no longer classified as a  blank check  or shell company, as defined by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance to investors that any broker-dealer will actually file the
materials required in order for such OTC Bulletin Board trading to proceed. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a rule
(Rule 419) which defines a blank-check company as (i) a development stage company, that is (ii) offering penny stock, as defined
by Rule 3a51-1, and (iii) that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is engage in a
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies. 

BUSINESS COMBINATION 

The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business
entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange (the  business combination ). In most instances the target company will wish to
structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating
with any target business. 

The Company has not restricted its search for any specific kind
of businesses, and it may acquire a business, which is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation,
or in essentially any stage of its business life. It is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may
become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may
seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer. 

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition,
the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation
or entity. 

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business
combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In
some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may agree to register all or a part of such
securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will
be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated
a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop
in the Company's securities may depress the market value of the Company's securities in the future if such a market develops, of
which there is no assurance. 

The Company will participate in a business combination only after
the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations with a target company will likely focus on the percentage
of the combined Company's shares, which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings. 

Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally
such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default,
will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and
will include miscellaneous other terms. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant
dilution effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company's shareholders at such time. 

OPERATIONAL RESULTS 

The Company has no current operating history and does not have
any revenues or earnings from operations. The Company has no assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain
operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in
the Company incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until the Company can consummate a business combination
with a profitable business opportunity. There is no assurance that we can identify such a business opportunity and consummate such
a business combination. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

On December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash and no other assets.
We are dependent upon our officers to meet any minimum costs that may occur. Mr. Zhong Fang, President of the Company, has agreed
to provide the necessary funds, without interest, for the Company to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
provided that he is President of the Company when the obligation is incurred. All advances are interest-free.

Risk  

None. 

Item 8. Financial Statements  

Financial Statements: Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations,

The Company is an inactive entity as defined by Section 3-11 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements required for purposes of reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 are unaudited.

                                    DECEMBER 31, 2015  

1. ORGANIZATIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Sino-American Net Media Corp (the  Company ) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 9, 2009 and has been inactive since inception. The Company intends to serve
as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or
foreign business. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Accounting  

The accompanying audited financial statements and related
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ) for annual financial information, and with the rules and regulations of SEC to Form 10-K and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. 

The Company selected its year-end on December 31. 

Development Stage Company  

The Company is a development stage company as defined by section
915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The Company has recognized no revenue since inception, and is still
devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.
All losses accumulated since inception, have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. 

Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements 

and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash Equivalents  

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
as of the reporting date. 

Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1,
which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 

Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by
market data. 

The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2015, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations
that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting
date for the period from February 9, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company will apply paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and
earned.  The Company will consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)collectability is reasonably assured.   

Income Taxes  

The Company will account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under Section 740-10-25,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures.  The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to
the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

Net Loss Per Common Share  

Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to
section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common
stock during each period.  There were no potentially  

dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

3. GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going
concern basis. The Company had minimal operations during the period from February 9, 2010(date of inception) to December 31, 2015
and has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. The Company will engage in very limited activities
without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer no
cash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing
contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur,
it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions
or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.

reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance.
