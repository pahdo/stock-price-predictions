NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September   30, 2016 

1. Organization and description of business 

PS Business Parks, Inc. ( PSB ) was incorporated in the state of California in 1990. As of   September 30, 2016  , PSB owned   77.9  % of the common partnership units   (the  common partnership units )   of PS Business Parks, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ). The remaining common partnership units are owned by Public Storage ( PS ). PSB, as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in managing and controlling the Operating Partnership. PSB and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership  ,   are collectively referred to as the  Company.  Assuming issuance of the Company s common stock upon redemption of its   common   partnership units, PS would own   42.0  % (  or   14.5   million shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.  

The Company is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office and industrial space. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned and operated   28.2   million rentable square feet of commercial space in   six   states. The Company also   manages   737,000   rentable   square feet on behalf of PS. 

References to the number of properties or square footage are unaudited and outside the scope of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm s review of the Company s financial statements   in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  . 

2. Summary of significant accounting policies 

Basis of presentation 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   

Consolidation and Equity Method of Accounting  

The Company accounts for its investment in a joint venture that it has significant influence over, but does not control, using the equity method of accounting eliminating intra-entity profits and losses as if the joint venture were a consolidated subsidiary. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSB and the Operating Partnership. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

The Company consolidates all variable interest entities (each a  VIE ) for which it is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a VIE is a legal entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. A limited partnership may be considered a VIE if the limited partners do not participate in operating decisions. Under this criteria, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE. The Company s significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, and consequently, substantially all of the Company s assets and  

7   

Table of Contents  

liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. All of the Company s debt is an obligation of the Operating Partnership. 

Noncontrolling interests 

The Company s noncontrolling interests are reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity. Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a gain or loss of control, the interests purchased or sold, as well as any interests retained, are recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. At the end of each reporting period, the Company determines the amount of equity (book value of net assets) which is allocable to the noncontrolling interests based upon the ownership interest, and an adjustment is made to the noncontrolling interests, with a corresponding adjustment to paid-in capital, to reflect the noncontrolling interests  equity interest in the Company. 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Allowance for doubtful accounts 

The Company monitors the collectability of its receivable balances including the deferred rent receivable on an ongoing basis. Based on these reviews, the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of tenants to make contractual rent payments to the Company. A provision for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against tenant and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Tenant receivables are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts totaling $  400,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Deferred rent receivable is net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts totaling $  919,000   and $  909,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Financial instruments 

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below. The Company has estimated the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of market value. Accordingly, estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges. The Company determines the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The following is the fair value hierarchy: 

* 

Level 1   quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;     

* 

Level 2   quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and     

* 

Level 3   fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.     

Financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of   three   months or less at the date of  

8   

Table of Contents  

purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market investments, are only invested in entities with an investment grade rating. Receivables are comprised of balances due from a large number of customers. Balances that the Company expects to become uncollectible are reserved for or written off. Due to the short period to maturity of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets and accrued and other liabilities, the carrying values as presented on the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair value.  

Carrying values of the Company s mortgage note payable and unsecured credit facility approximate fair value. The characteristics of these financial instruments, market data and other comparative metrics utilized in determining these fair values are  Level 2  inputs. 

Real estate facilities 

Real estate facilities are recorded at cost. Costs related to the renovation or improvement of the properties are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that are expected to benefit a period greater than   two   years and exceed   $2,000   are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life. Buildings and improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from   five   to   30   years. Transaction costs, which include tenant improvements and lease commissions, of   $1,000   or more for leases with terms greater than   one   year are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Transaction costs less than   $1,000   or for leases of   one   year or less are expensed as incurred. 

Land held for future development 

Property taxes, insurance, interest and costs essential to the development of property for its intended use are capitalized during the period of development. Upon classification of an asset as held for development, depreciation of the asset is ceased. 

Properties held for disposition 

An asset is classified as an asset held for disposition when it meets certain requirements, which include, among other criteria, the approval of the sale of the asset, the marketing of the asset for sale and the expectation by the Company that the sale will likely occur within the next   12   months. Upon classification of an asset as held for disposition, depreciation of the asset is ceased, and the net book value of the asset is included on the balance sheet as properties held for disposition.  

Intangible assets/liabilities 

Intangible assets and liabilities include above-market and below-market in-place lease values of acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values (included in other assets and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) are amortized to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the value of in-place leases resulted in net intangible assets of $  1.2   million, net of $  9.0   million of accumulated amortization with a weighted average amortization period of   9.2   years, and net intangible liabilities of $  990,000  , net of $  9.8   million of a  ccumulated amortization with a weighted average amortization period   of   6.3   years.   As of   December 31, 2015  , the value of in-place leases resulted in net intangible assets of $  1.7   million, net of $  8.6   million of accumulated amortization and net intangible liabilities of $  1.8   million, net of $  9.0   million of accumulated amortization.

Table of Contents  

The Company recorded net increases in rental income of   $106,000   and   $341,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $437,000   and   $1.0     million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, due to the amortization of net intangible liabilities resulting from the above-market and below-market lease values.  

Evaluation of asset impairment 

The Company evaluates its assets used in operations for impairment by identifying indicators of impairment and by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for each asset to the asset s carrying value. When indicators of impairment are present and the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s current carrying value and its value based on discounting its estimated future cash flows. In addition, the Company evaluates its assets held for disposition for impairment. Assets held for disposition are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less cost of disposition. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not consider any assets to be impaired. 

Stock compensation 

All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as stock compensation in the Company s income statement based on their grant date fair values. See Note 12. 

Revenue and expense recognition 

The Company must meet four basic criteria before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. All leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Straight-line rent is recognized for all tenants with contractual fixed increases in rent that are not included on the Company s credit watch list. Deferred rent receivable represents rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed rents. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as rental income in the period the applicable costs are incurred. Property management fees are recognized in the period earned. 

Costs incurred in connection with leasing (primarily tenant improvements and lease commissions) are capitalized and amortized over the lease period. 

Gains from sales of real estate   facilities 

The Company recognizes gains from sales of real estate facilities at the time of sale using the full accrual method, provided that various criteria related to the terms of the transactions and any subsequent involvement by the Company with the properties sold are met. If the criteria are not met, the Company defers the gains and recognizes them when the criteria are met or uses the installment or cost recovery methods as appropriate under the circumstances. 

General and administrative   expenses 

General and administrative expenses include executive and other compensation, office expenses, professional fees, acquisition transaction costs, state income taxes and other such administrative items. 

Income taxes 

The Company has qualified and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT, as defined in Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax to the extent that it distributes its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. A REIT must distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income each  

10   

Table of Contents  

year. In addition, REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operating requirements. The Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. The Company believes it met all organization and operating requirements to maintain its REIT status during   2015   and intends to continue to meet such requirements for   2016  . Accordingly,   no   provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The Company can recognize a tax benefit only if it is  more likely than not  that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent that the  more likely than not  standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than   50%   likely of being recognized upon settlement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not recognize any tax benefit for uncertain tax positions. 

Accounting for preferred equity issuance costs 

The Company records issuance costs as a reduction to paid-in capital on its balance sheet at the time the preferred securities are issued and reflects the carrying value of the preferred equity at the stated value. Such issuance costs are recorded as non-cash preferred equity distributions at the time the Company notifies the holders of preferred stock of its intent to redeem such shares. 

Net income allocation 

Net income was allocated as follows   (in thousands)  : 

Net income per common share 

Per share amounts are computed using the number of weighted average common shares outstanding.  Diluted  weighted average common shares outstanding includes the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units under the treasury stock method.  Basic  weighted average common shares outstanding excludes such effect. The Company's restricted stock units are participating securities and are included in the computation of basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The Company s restricted stock unit holders are paid   non-forfeitable   dividends   in excess of the expense     recorded which results in   a reduction in net income allocable to common shareholders and unit holders.

Earnings per share has been calculated as follows (  in thousands, except per share amounts  ): 

No   options   were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     as no options were considered anti-dilutive.   Options to purchase   25,000   shares   were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     as such   options were considered anti-dilutive.     Options to purchase   46,000   shares   were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015     as   such options were considered anti-dilutive. 

Segment reporting 

The Company views its operations as   one   segment. 

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements for 2015 in order to conform to the 2016 presentation. 

Recently issued accounting standards 

In May, 2014, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board     (   FASB   )   issued   Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ,   which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new accounting guidance establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is currently effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The amendment allows for full retrospective adoption applied to all periods presented or modified retrospective adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company anticipates no impact upon adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February, 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which amended the existing accounting standards for consolidation under both the variable interest model and the voting model. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this guidance and as the Operating Partnership is already  

12   

Table of Contents  

consolidated in the balance sheets of the Company, the identification of this entity as a VIE has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additionally, the Company s accounting for its investment in its joint venture was not impacted by the adoption of this guidance.  

In February, 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02,   Leases,   which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting  . The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under this guidance. However, the guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.   The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In   March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU   2016-09  ,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , to amend the accounting guidance for share-based payment accounting.   The guidance   is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.   This guidance   is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

3. Real estate facilities 

The activity in real   estate facilities for   the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is   as f  ollows   (in thousands)  : 

The purchase price of acquired properties is recorded to land, buildings and improvements (including tenant improvements, unamortized lease commissions, acquired in-place lease values, and tenant relationships, if any) and intangible assets and liabilities associated with the value of above-market and below-market leases based on their respective estimated fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 

In determining the fair value of the tangible assets of the acquired properties, management considers the value of the properties as if vacant as of the acquisition date. Management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Using different assumptions in the recording of the purchase cost of the acquired properties would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses. Amounts recorded to land are derived from comparable sales of land within the same region.

All operating metrics discussed in this section as of and for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015     exclude sold assets. Management believes excluding the results of such assets provides the most relevant perspective on the ongoing operations of the Company. Please refer to  Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements  included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for financial metrics that include results from sold assets. 

The Company focuses on increasing profitability and cash flow aimed at maximizing shareholder value. The Company strives to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates and minimizing capital expenditures when market conditions allow, although the Company may decrease rental rates in markets where conditions require. The Company also acquires properties it believes will create long-term value, and from time to time disposes of properties which no longer fit within the Company s strategic objectives. Operating results are driven primarily by income from rental operations and are therefore substantially influenced by demand for rental space within our properties and our markets, which impacts occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements. 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company executed leases comprising   5.5   million square feet of space including   3.8   million square feet of renewals of existing leases and   1.7   million square feet of new leases. Overall, the change in rental rates for the Company continued to improve. See further discussion of operating results below. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:   Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, property acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation, accruals of operating expenses and accruals for contingencies, each of which are more fully described in  Part I, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   

Effect of Economic Conditions on the Company s Operations:   During the first   nine   months of   2016  , most markets continued to reflect favorable conditions allowing for   stable and improving occupancy as well as increasing rental rates.   With the exception of the Virginia and Maryland markets, new rental rates for the Company improved

over expiring rental rates on executed   leases as economic conditions   and tenant demand remained healthy.   The Virginia and Maryland markets continue to experience soft market conditions   as evidenced by continued pressure on   occupancy and   rental rates. In these markets, rental rates on   executed   leases declined 7.7% and 5.2%, respectively  , over expiring rents for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Given lease   expirations of 1.2 million   square feet in   Virginia and 418,000 square   feet in Maryland through December 31, 2017, the Company may continue to experience a decrease in rental income in these markets.    

Tenant Credit Risk:   The Company historically has experienced a low level of write-offs of uncollectable rents, but there is inherent uncertainty in a tenant s ability to continue paying rent and meet its full lease obligation. The table below summarizes the impact to the Company from tenants  inability to pay rent or continue to meet their lease obligations   (in thousands)  :

As of October 24  , 2016, the Company had   12,000   square feet of leased space occupied by tenants that are protected by Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. From time to time, tenants contact us, requesting early termination of their   lease, reductions in space under lease, or rent deferment or abatement. At this time, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our future operating results. 

Company Performance and Effect of Economic Conditions on Primary Markets:   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , initial rental rates on new and renewed leases within the Company s total portfolio increased   5.2%   over expiring rents,   an improvement from   the year ended December 31, 2015   in which initial rental rates on new and renewed leases increased 4.4%  . The Company s Same Park (defined below) occupancy rate at   September 30, 2016   was   94.5%  , compared to   93.7%   at   September 30, 2015  . The Company s operations are substantially concentrated in eight regions. Each of the eight regions in which the Company owns assets is subject to its own unique market influences. See  Supplemental Property Data and Trends  below for more information on regional operating data. 

Effect of Acquisitions and Dispositions of     Properties on the Company s Operations:   The Company is focused on growing its operations by looking for opportunities to expand its presence in existing and new markets through strategic acquisitions that meet the Company s focus on multi-tenant flex, industrial and office parks in markets where it has or may obtain a substantial market presence. The Company may also from time to time dispose of assets based on market conditions. 

On September 28, 2016, the Company acquired two multi-tenant office buildings aggregating 226,000 square feet in Rockville, Maryland  ,   for a purchase price of $13.3 million. The buildings, which were 18.5% leased at the time of acquisition, are located within Shady Grove Executive Park, where the Company   owns three other buildings comprised of 352,000 square feet, which   were 86.4% leased as of September 30, 2016.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the bl  ended occupancy rate   of the   six   assets   acquired during   2014   and 2016  , which   comprise the 904,000 square   feet of   Non-Same Park portfolio (defined below), was   78.5%   compared to a blended occupancy rate of   39.7%   at the time of acquisition. The table below   contains the assets acquired during   2014   and 2016     (dollars and square feet in thousa  nds)  : 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015,   the Company completed the sale of   assets in   Tempe, Arizona,   Sacramento, California, Milwaukie, Oregon and Redmond, Washington. The assets sold   aggregat  ed     574  ,000   square feet   and generated   net proceeds of   $55  .  2   million, which resulted in a  n aggregate   gain of   $  28.2 million  . 

In 2013, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which it will maintain 95.0% economic interest, known as Amherst JV LLC, (the  Joint Venture ) with an unrelated real estate development company for the purpose of developing a 395-unit multi-family building on a five-acre site, to be known as Highgate, within its Westpark Business Park in Tysons, Virginia. The Company contributed the site, along with capitalized improvements, to the Joint Venture on October 5, 2015. Subsequent to the contribution date, demolition, site preparation and construction commenced and is expected to be completed in late 2017.  

Along with the equity capital the Company has committed to the Joint Venture, the   Company has also agreed to provide the Joint Venture with a construction loan in the amount of $75.0 million. The Joint Venture will pay interest under the construction loan at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 2.25%. The loan will mature on April 5, 2019.   The aggregate amount of development costs are estimated to   be $105.6 million   (excluding unrealized land   appreciation  ),   of   which the Company is committed to funding $75.0 million through a construction loan in addition to total equity and capital contributions of $28.5 million, which includes a land basis of $15.3 million, to the Joint Venture. 

The Company s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint venture was   $55.5   million and $26.7 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company   made   loan advan  ces of $22.3   million  , capital contributions of $5.7 million and capitalized   $854,000     of   interest. For   the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company capitalized costs of   $2.8   million related to this development, of which   $813,000   was   capit  alized interest. The Company made   no loan advances to the Joint Venture in 2015. 

Scheduled Lease Expirations:   In addition   to the 1.7 million square   feet,   or 6.0%, of vacancy   in our total portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  ,    557   leases  ,    representing 1.4 million   square feet, or   5.3%  , of the leased square footage of our total portfolio are scheduled to expire during the remainder of   2016  . Our ability to re-lease available space will depend upon market conditions in the specific submarkets in which our properties are located. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty the rate at which expiring leases will be re-leased. 

Impact of Inflation:   Although inflation has not been significant in recent years, it remains a potential factor   in our economy, and the Company continues to seek ways to mitigate its potential impact. A substantial portion of the Company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance, as well as increases in common area expenses, partially reducing the Company s exposure to inflation.

Table of Contents  

Net Operating Income:   Rental income, cost of operations and rental income less cost of operations, excluding depreciation   and amortization, or net operating income (defined as  NOI  for purposes of the following tables), are summarized for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .    NOI is   a non-GAAP financial measure   that is often used by investors to determine the performance and value of commercial real estate  .    Depreciation and amortization have been excluded from NOI as they are generally not used in determining the value of commercial real estate by management or the investment community. Depreciation and amortization are generally not used in determining value as they consider the historical costs of an asset compared to its current value; therefore, to understand the effect of the assets  historical cost on the Company s results, investors should look at GAAP financial measures, such as total operating costs including depreciation and amortization. The Company s calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. As part of the tables below, we have reconciled total NOI to net income, which we consider the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

In order to provide a meaningful period-to-period comparison,   for the purpose of computing NOI,   the tables below exclude amortization of the Senior Management Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan ( LTEIP ).

Comparative Analysis of the T  hree and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to the Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015 

Results of Operations:   In order to evaluate the performance of the Company s portfolio over comparable periods, management analyzes the operating performance of properties owned and operated throughout both periods (herein referred to as  Same Park ). The Same Park portfolio includes all operating properties acquired prior to January 1, 2014. Operating properties acquired subsequently are referred to as  Non-Same Park.  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Same Park facilities constitute   27.3   million rentable   square feet, representing   96.8%   of the   28.2   million square feet in the Company s total portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The following table presents the operating results of the Company s properties for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in addition to other income and expenses items affecting net income   (in     thousands, except per square foot data)  :

Rental Income:     Rental income increased $4.0 million from $93.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $97.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Rental income increased $10.7 million from $278.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $289.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For comparative purposes, management has adjusted rental income for a material lease buyout payment of $528,000 recorded in the third quarter of 2016 and rental income from sold assets of $345,000 and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Adjusted r  e  ntal income increased   $3.8   million from   $93.0   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $96.8   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of an increase in   the   Same Park   portfolio   of   $3.5     million,     or   3.8  %, combined     with a   $380,000  ,    or 28.1%, increase   from Non-Same Park facilities.   Adjusted r  ental income increased   $12.9   million from   $275.9   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $288.7   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of an increase in   the   Same Park   portfolio   of   $11.5   million,   or 4.2  %,   combined with a   $1.4   million  ,    or 37.9%, increase   from Non-Same Park facilities. The   three   and   nine   month increase  s in Same Park rental income were   due to an increase in occupancy and executed ren  tal rates. 

Facility Management Fees:   Facility management fees, derived from Public Storage ( PS ), account for a small portion of the Company s revenues.   The Company recognized facility management fees of $  130,000   for the three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company recognized facility management fees of     $389,000     compared to   $410,000   for the same period in   2015  .    The   nine month   decrease resulted from a reduction in total square footage managed on behalf of PS   beginning the latter half of 2015  . 

Cost of Operations:   C  ost of operations increased $348,000,   or   1.1%  ,    from   $30.4   million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016  .   Cost of operations increased $189,000, or 0.2%, from $92.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $92.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   For comparative purposes, management has adjusted cost of operations   for   LTEIP amortization of $657,000 and $2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $284,000 and $1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as well as, cost of operations from sold assets of $203,000 and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . Adjusted c  ost of operations increased   $178,000  ,    or   0.6%  ,    from   $30.0   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $30.1   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     as a result of an   increase     in the Same Park portfolio of   $168,000  ,    or 0.6%  , combined with a     $10,000  , or   1.9%  , increase in the   Non-Same Park facilities  .    The three month increase in Same Park cost of operat  ions was due to an increase in property taxes as a result of increases in assessed values partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense.   Adjusted c  ost   of operations increased   $914,000  , or   1.0%  , from   $89.2   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $90.1   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of an increase in the Same Park portfolio of   $927,000  ,    or 1.1%, partially   offset by a decrease in the Non-Same Park facilities of   $13,000  ,    or 0.8%.     The nine   month increase was   due to increases in property taxes and   repairs and maintenance costs   partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense:   Depreciation and amortization expense was   $24.6   million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $26.0   million for the same period in   2015  . Depreciation and amortization expense was   $74.9   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $79.2   million for the same period in   2015  . The three and   nine   month decreases in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the disposition of assets.

General and Administrative Expenses  : General and administrative expenses   decreased $306,000,   or 9  .3%  ,    from   $3.3   million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016  .   General and administrative expense increased $1.8 million, or 17.8%, from $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For comparative purposes, management has adjusted general and   administrative expenses for     LTEIP amortization of $907,000 and $5.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1.4 million and $4.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as well as,   acquisition transaction costs of $328,000 recorded   during the third quarter of 2016. The nine month increase in the LTEIP amortization was primarily due to   a net   non-cash stock compensation   charge     of $2.0 million recorded   during the second quarter of 2016     related to   a change in senior management and the future issuances of restricted stock units our   former Chief Executive Officer will   receive   under the Company s LTEIP.    A  djusted   genera  l and administrative expenses de  creased   $158,000  , or   8.3%  ,    f  or the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the same period in 2015 due to a decrease in compensation expense resulting from a change in senior management. Adjusted general administrative expenses increased   $61,000  , or   1.1%  , for the   nine   months ended September 31, 2016 over the same period   in   2015   due to acquisition and development costs   partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense  . 

Net Income Allocable to Noncontrolling Interests:   Net income allocable to noncontrolling   interests reflects the net income alloc  able to equity interests in   PS Business Parks, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership )   that are not owned by the Company. Net income allocable to noncontrolling interests was   $5.3   million and   $6.1   million of allocated income to common unit holders for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net income allocable to noncontrolling interests was   $13.5   million and   $14.5   million of allocated income to common unit holders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   three and     nine   month decrease  s    w  ere   primarily the result of   the gain on sale of real estate facilities recognized   in 2015   partially offset by an increase in overall NOI. 

Supplemental Property Data and Trends:   NOI is summarized for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   by region below. See above for more information on NOI, including why the Company presents NOI and how the Company uses NOI. The Company s calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

The following tables summarize the Same Park and Non-Same Park operating results by region for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . In addition, the tables reflect the comparative impact on the overall rental income, cost of operations and NOI from properties that have been acquired since January 1, 2014, and the impact of such is included in Non-Same Park facilities in the tables below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash and cash equivalents decreased   $183.9   million from   $188.9   million at   December 31, 2015   to   $5.0   million at   September 30, 2016   for the reasons noted below. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $187.7   million and   $178.6   million, respectively. The increase   of $  9.1   million   in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in NOI. Management believes that the Company s internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to enable it to meet its operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future. 

Net cash used in investing activities was   $65.7   million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of     $17.3   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to net proceeds of   $55.2 million   received from assets sold in 2015 c  ombined with a   $28.8   million increase in cash investment in the Joint Venture   and $12.6 million acquisition in Rockville, Maryland, in 2016  . This change was partially offset by a decrease in cash paid related to capital improvements. 

Net cash used in financing activities was   $305.9   million and   $96.2   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively  .    The change was primarily due to repayment of   a    mortgage note of $250.0 million in 2016 using cash on hand and borrowings from the Credit Facility (de  fined below).   This change was also impacted by an increase in quarterly distributions paid to common shareholders   of $22.5 million   (year-to-date increase from $1.6  0 per share to $  2  .  25   per share).

The Credit Facility has a borrowing limit of $250.0 million and expires May 1, 2019. The rate of interest charged on borrowings is based on the LIBOR plus 0.875% to LIBOR plus 1.70% depending on the Company s credit ratings. Currently,   the Company s rate under the Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.875%. In addition, the Company is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% of the borrowing limit depending on the Company s credit ratings (currently 0.125%). As of   September 30, 2016  , the   Company had $60.0 million   outstanding on the Credit Faci  lity at an interest rate of 1.36  %. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid   the outstanding balance in full  . The Company had no balance outstanding on the Credit Facility at   December 31, 2015  . The Company had   $596,000   and   $769,000   of unamortized commitment fees as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively  , which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  . The Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest on outstanding   borrowings is payable monthly.  

The Company s preferred equity outstanding decreased from 22.0% of its market capitalization at December 31, 2015   to 18.8%   at   September 30, 2016   primarily due to an increase in stock price from $87.43 at December 31, 2015   to $113.57 a  t    September 30, 2016  . The Company calculates market capitalization by adding (1) the liquidation preference of the Company s outstanding preferred equity, (2) principal value of the Company s outstanding debt and (3) the total number of common shares and common units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   multiplied by the closing price of the stock on that date.  

The Company focuses on retaining cash for reinvestment, as we believe this provides us the greatest level of financial flexibility. As operating fundamentals improve, additional increases in distributions to the Company s common shareholders may be required. The Company will continue to monitor its taxable income and the corresponding dividend requirements. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.  6  0 per common share to $0.75 per common share, increasing quarterly distributions by $5.2 million per quarter. 

Issuance of Preferred Stock:   Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company issued $189.8 million or 7,590,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of a share of the 5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series W, at $25.00 per depositary share. The Company will use the net proceeds from this issuance to pay amounts outstanding under the Company s Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including the potential redemption of preferred equity. 

Repurchase of Common Stock:   No shares of common stock w  ere repurchased under the board-  approved common stock repurchase program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Capital Expenditures:   The Company defines recurring capital expenditures as those necessary to maintain and operate its commercial real estate at its current economic value. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company expended   $23.5   million and   $32.1   million, respectively, in recurring capital expenditures, or   $0.84   and   $1.13   per weighted average square foot owned, respectively. Tenant improvement amounts exclude those amounts reimbursed by the tenants. Nonrecurring capital improvements include property renovations and expenditures related to repositioning acquisitions. The following table depicts capital expenditures   (in thousands)  :

Table of Contents  

Capital expenditures on a per square foot owned basis are as follows:  

The decrease in recurring capital expenditures   of $8.6 million, or 26.9%, was   primarily due to lower tenant improvement costs and continued efforts to reduce capital expenditures. 

Distributions:   The Company has elected and intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, the Company must meet, among other tests, sources of income, share ownership and certain asset tests. As a REIT, the Company is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders provided that at least 90% of its taxable income is distributed to its shareholders prior to the filing of its tax return. 

The Company s funding strategy has been to primarily use permanent capital, including common and preferred stock, along with internally generated retained cash flows to meet its liquidity needs. In addition, the Company may sell properties that no longer meet its investment criteria. From time to time, the Company may use its Credit Facility or other forms of debt to facilitate real estate acquisitions or other capital allocations.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions coverage ratio was 2.3 to 1.0.   The Company targets a minimum ratio of FFO   (as defined below)   to   combined fixed charges and preferred distributions of 3.0 to 1.0. Fixed charges include interest expense and capitalized interest while preferred distributions include amounts paid to preferred shareholders and preferred Operating Partnership unit holders. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the FFO to   combined   fixed charges and preferred distributions coverage ratio was   3.9   to 1.0. 

Non-GAAP Supplemental Disclosure Measure: Funds from Operations:   Management believes that Funds from Operations ( FFO )   and FFO, as adjusted are   useful supplemental measure  s   of the Company s operating performance  . The Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The White Paper defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, before depreciation, amortization, gains or losses on asset dispositions, net income allocable to noncontrolling interests  common units, net income allocable to restricted stock unit holders, impairment charges and nonrecurring items. Management believes that FFO provides a useful measure of the Company s operating performance and when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income. 

FFO   and FFO, as adjusted   should be analyzed in conjunction with net income. However, FFO   and FFO, as adjusted should not be viewed as   substitute  s   for net income as   m  easure  s   of operatin  g performance or liquidity as they do   not reflect depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company s properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially affect the Company s results of operations. 

Management believes FFO provides useful information to the investment community about the Company s operating performance when compared to the performance of other real estate companies as FFO is generally  

33   

Table of Contents  

recognized as the industry standard for reporting operations of REITs.   Management believes FFO, as adjusted provides useful information to the investment community by adjusting FFO for certain items so as to provide more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our operating performance.   Other REITs may use different methods for calculating FFO   and/or FFO, as adjusted   and, accordingly, our FFO   and FFO, as adjusted   may not be comparable to other real estate companies    FFO and/or FFO, as adjusted  . 

FFO for the Company is computed as follows (  in thousands, except per share data  ):

Per share amounts are computed using additional dilutive shares related to noncontrolling interests and restricted stock units.

T  he   following   table reco  nciles reported FFO to   FFO  , as adjusted  , which excludes   a    material   lease buyout payment of $528,000   related to   a 58,000 square foot lease in Virginia  , non-cash distributions related to the redemption of preferred equity, acquisition transaction costs and a net   non-cash stock compensation   charge   of $2.0 million. 

FFO   allocable to common and dilutive shares, as adjusted, increased   $8.2   million and   $19.0   million for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The three and   nine   month increases were due to an increase in NOI and savings from preferred distributions relating to the redemption of preferred equity and lower interest expense  . 

Related Party Transactions:   Assuming issuance of the Company s common stock upon redemption of its   common   partnership units, PS would own   42.0%   (or   14.5 million   shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , PS owned   26.4%   of the Operating Partnership (100.0% of the common units not owned by the Company). Ronald L. Havner, Jr., the Company s chairman, is also the Chairman of the Board, Chief   Executive Officer   of PS.   Joseph D. Russell, Jr. is a director of the Company and also President of PS.   Gary E. Pruitt, an independent director of the Company is also a trustee of PS. 

Pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services agreement, the Company shares costs with PS for certain administrative services and rental of corporate office space. The administrative services include investor relations, legal, corporate tax and information systems, which were allocated to PS in accordance with a methodology intended to fairly allocate those costs. These costs   totaled $123,000 and $117,000 for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   and $370,000 and $352,000 for   the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. In addition, the Company provides property management services for properties owned by PS for a management fee of 5% of the gross revenues of such properties in addition to reimbursement of direct costs. These management fee revenues recognized under a management contract with PS totaled   $130,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $389,000   and   $410,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. PS also provides property management services for the self-storage component of two assets owned by the Company for a fee of 6% of the gross revenues of such properties in addition to reimbursement of certain costs. Management fee expense recognized under the management contract with PS   totaled $22,000 and $21,000 for   the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   and $64,000 and $59,000 for   the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:   The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Contractual Obligations:   The Company is scheduled to pay cash dividends of $55.3 million per year on its preferred equity outstanding as   of   September 30, 2016  . Dividends are paid when and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors and accumulate if not paid. Shares of preferred equity are redeemable by the Company in order to preserve its status as a REIT and are also redeemable five years after issuance. 

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

To limit the Company s exposure to market risk, the Company principally finances its operations and growth with permanent equity capital consisting of either common or preferred stock. As a result, the Company s debt as a percentage of total equity (based on book values) was   3.2%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Credit Facility, which is subject to variabl  e interest rates. See Notes 2, 6   and   7   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the terms, valuations and approximate principal maturities of the Company s indebtedness, including the mortgage note payable and Credit Facility. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company, the difference between the carrying amount of   debt and its fair value is insignificant. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief   Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  . Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company currently is not subject to any material litigation other than routine litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS    

There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

PS BUSINESS PARKS, L.P.  

AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT OF LIMITED  

PARTNERSHIP RELATING TO  

5.20% SERIES W CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE  

PREFERRED UNITS  

This Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of PS Business Parks, L.P., a California limited partnership (the    Partnership   ), dated as of October 20, 2016 (this    Amendment   ), amends the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, dated as of March 17, 1998, as amended, by and among PS Business Parks, Inc. (the    General Partner   ) and each of the limited partners described on Exhibit A to that partnership agreement (the    Partnership Agreement   ). Section references are (unless otherwise specified) references to sections in this Amendment.  

WHEREAS, the General Partner agreed to issue up to 7,590,000 Depositary Shares each representing 1/1000th of a share of the General Partner s preferred stock designated as the  5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series W  (the    Depositary Shares   ) for a price of $25.00 per Depositary Share;  

WHEREAS, Section 4.1(b)(2) of the Partnership Agreement requires the General Partner to contribute to the Partnership the funds raised through the issuance of additional shares of the General Partner in return for additional Partnership Units, and provides that the General Partner s capital contribution shall be deemed to equal the amount of the gross proceeds of that share issuance (i.e., the net proceeds actually contributed, plus any underwriter s discount or other expenses incurred, with any such discount or expense deemed to have been incurred on behalf of the Partnership);  

WHEREAS, Section 4.2(a) of the Partnership Agreement provides generally for the creation and issuance of Partnership Units with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers and duties senior to other Partnership Interests, all as shall be determined by the General Partner, without the consent of the Limited Partners, and Section 4.2(b) of the Partnership Agreement specifically contemplates the issuance of Units to the General Partner having designations, preferences and other rights, all such that the economic interests are substantially similar to the designations, preferences and other rights of shares issued by the General Partner, such as the Depositary Shares;  

WHEREAS, the General Partner desires to cause the Partnership to issue additional Units of a new class and series, with the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties set forth herein; and  

WHEREAS, the General Partner desires by this Amendment to so amend the Partnership Agreement as of the date first set forth above to provide for the designation and issuance of such new class and series of Units.  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by establishing and fixing the rights, limitations and preferences of a new class and series of Units as follows:  

Section 1. Definitions  . Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have their respective meanings set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Capitalized terms that are used in this Amendment shall have the meanings set forth below:  

(a)    Liquidation Preference    means, with respect to the Series W Preferred Units (as defined below), $25.00 per Series W Preferred Unit, plus the amount of any accumulated and unpaid Priority Return (as defined below) with respect to such Series W Preferred Unit, whether or not declared, minus any distributions in excess of the Priority Return that has accrued with respect to such Series W Preferred Units, to the date of payment.  

(b)    Parity Preferred Units    means any class or series of Partnership Interests (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership now or hereafter authorized, issued or outstanding and expressly designated by the Partnership to rank on a parity with the Series W Preferred Units with respect to distributions and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Partnership, including the 6.45% Series S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the    Series S Preferred Units   ), the 6.00% Series T Cumulative  

Redeemable Preferred Units (the    Series T Preferred Units   ), the 5.75% Series U Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the    Series U Preferred Units   ) and the 5.70% Series V Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the    Series V Preferred Units   ). Notwithstanding the differing allocation rights set forth in Section 4 below that apply to the Series S, T, U and V Preferred Units.  

(c)    Priority Return    means an amount equal to 5.20% per annum, of the Liquidation Preference per Series W Preferred Unit, commencing on the date of issuance of such Series W Preferred Unit, determined on the basis of a 360-day year (and twelve 30-day months), cumulative to the extent not distributed on any Series W Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date (as defined below).  

Section 2. Creation of Series W Preferred Units  . (a)   Designation and Number.   Pursuant to Section 4.2(a) of the Partnership Agreement, a series of Partnership Units (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement) in the Partnership designated as the  5.20% Series W Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units  (the    Series W Preferred Units   ) is hereby established effective as of October 20, 2016. The number of Series W Preferred Units shall be 7,590,000. The Holders of Series W Preferred Units shall not have any Percentage Interest (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement) in the Partnership.  

(b)   Capital Contribution  . In return for the issuance to the General Partner of the Series W Preferred Units set forth on Exhibit C to this Amendment, the General Partner has contributed to the Partnership the funds raised through the General Partner s issuance of the Depositary Shares (the General Partner s capital contribution shall be deemed to equal the amount of the gross proceeds of that share issuance,   i.e.  , the net proceeds actually contributed, plus any underwriter s discount or other expenses incurred, with any such discount or expense deemed to have been incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership).  

(c)   Construction  . The Series W Preferred Units have been created and are being issued in conjunction with the General Partner s issuance of the Depositary Shares relating to the General Partner s 5.20% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series W, and as such, the Series W Preferred Units are intended to have designations, preferences and other rights, all such that the economic interests are substantially similar to the designations, preferences and other rights of the Depositary Shares, and the terms of this Amendment shall be interpreted in a fashion consistent with this intent.  

Section 3. Distributions  . (a)   Payment of Distributions  . Subject to the rights of holders of Parity Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions, pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Partnership Agreement, holders of Series W Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Partnership acting through the General Partner, the Priority Return. Such distributions shall be cumulative, shall accrue from the original date of issuance of the Series W Preferred Units and, notwithstanding Section 5.1 of the Partnership Agreement, will be payable (i) quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year commencing on December 31, 2016 and (ii) in the event of a redemption of Series W Preferred Units (each a    Series W Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date   ). If any date on which distributions are to be made on the Series W Preferred Units is not a Business Day (as defined below), then payment of the distribution to be made on such date will be made on the Business Day immediately preceding such date with the same force and effect as if made on such date. Distributions on the Series W Preferred Units will be made to the holders of record of the Series W Preferred Units on the relevant record dates to be fixed by the Partnership acting through the General Partner, which record dates shall in no event exceed fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the relevant Series W Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date. Business Day shall be any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or day on which banking institutions in the State of New York or the State of California are authorized or obligated by law to close, or a day which is or is declared a national or a New York or California state holiday.  

(b)   Prohibition on Distribution  . No distributions on Series W Preferred Units shall be authorized by the General Partner or paid or set apart for payment by the Partnership at any such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Partnership or the General Partner, including any agreement relating to their indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or to the extent that such authorization or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.  

(c)   Distributions Cumulative  . Distributions on the Series W Preferred Units will accrue whether or not the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Partnership, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, at  

any time prohibit the current payment of distributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series W Preferred Units will accumulate as of the Series W Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date on which they first become payable. Distributions on account of arrears for any past distribution periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to a regular Series W Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date, to holders of record of the Series W Preferred Units on the record date fixed by the Partnership acting through the General Partner which date shall not exceed fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the payment date. Accumulated and unpaid distributions will not bear interest.  

(d)   Priority as to Distributions  . Subject to the provisions of Article 13 of the Partnership Agreement:  

(i) So long as any Series W Preferred Units are outstanding, no distribution of cash or other property shall be authorized, declared, paid or set apart for payment on or with respect to any class or series of Partnership Interests ranking junior as to the payment of distributions or rights upon a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership to the Series W Preferred Units (collectively,    Junior Units   ), nor shall any cash or other property be set aside for or applied to the purchase, redemption or other acquisition for consideration of any Series W Preferred Units, any Parity Preferred Units or any Junior Units, unless, in each case, all distributions accumulated on all Series W Preferred Units and all classes and series of outstanding Parity Preferred Units have been paid in full. The foregoing sentence shall not prohibit (x) distributions payable solely in Junior Units, or (y) the conversion of Junior Units or Parity Preferred Units into Partnership Interests ranking junior to the Series W Preferred Units.  

(ii) So long as distributions have not been paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not irrevocably deposited in trust for payment) upon the Series W Preferred Units, all distributions authorized and declared on the Series W Preferred Units and all classes or series of outstanding Parity Preferred Units shall be authorized and declared so that the amount of distributions authorized and declared per Series W Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series W Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units (which shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for prior distribution periods if such class or series of Parity Preferred Units do not have cumulative distribution rights) bear to each other.  

(e)   No Further Rights  . Holders of Series W Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions, whether payable in cash, other property or otherwise, in excess of the full cumulative distributions described herein.  

Section 4. Allocations  . Section 6.1(a)(ii) of the Partnership Agreement is amended to read, in its entirety, as follows:  

(ii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in any taxable year: (1) the holders of Series S, T, U, V and W Preferred Units shall be allocated an amount of gross income equal to the Priority Return distributed to such holders in such taxable year.  

(B) After the Capital Account balances of all Partners other than holders of any series of Preferred Units have been reduced to zero, Losses of the Partnership that otherwise would be allocated so as to cause deficit Capital Account balances for those other Partners shall be allocated to the holders of the Series S, T, U, V and W Preferred Units in proportion to the positive balances of their Capital Accounts until those Capital Account balances have been reduced to zero. If Losses have been allocated to the holders of the Series S, T, U, V and W Preferred Units pursuant to the preceding sentence, the first subsequent Profits shall be allocated to those preferred partners so as to recoup, in reverse order, the effects of the loss allocations.  

(C) Upon liquidation of the Partnership or the interest of the holders of Series S, T, U, V and W Preferred Units in the Partnership, items of gross income or deduction shall be allocated to the holders of Series S, T, U, V and W Preferred Units in a manner such that, immediately prior to such liquidation, the Capital Account balances of such holders shall equal the amount of their Liquidation Preferences.   

Section 5. Optional Redemption  . The Series W Preferred Units shall be redeemed at the same time, to the same extent, and applying, except as set forth below, similar procedures, as any redemption by the General Partner of the Depositary Shares. The redemption price, payable in cash, shall equal the Liquidation Preference (the    Series W Redemption Price   ). Unless otherwise agreed, the Partnership will deliver into escrow with an escrow agent  

acceptable to the Partnership and the holders of the Series W Preferred Units being redeemed (the    Escrow Agent   ) the Series W Redemption Price and an executed Redemption Agreement, in substantially the form attached as   Exhibit A   (the    Redemption Agreement   ), and an Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership evidencing the Redemption, in substantially the form attached as   Exhibit B  . The holders of the Series W Preferred Units to be redeemed will also deliver into escrow with the Escrow Agent an executed Redemption Agreement and an executed Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership evidencing the redemption. Upon delivery of all of the above-described items by both parties, on the redemption date the Escrow Agent shall release the Series W Redemption Price to the holders of the Series W Preferred Units and the fully-executed Redemption Agreement and Amendment to Agreement of Limited Partnership to both parties. On and after the date of redemption, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series W Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in the payment of the Series W Redemption Price. The Redemption Right (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement) given to Limited Partners (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement) in Section 8.6 of the Partnership Agreement shall not be available to the holders of the Series W Preferred Units and all references to Limited Partners in said Section 8.6 (and related provisions of the Partnership Agreement) shall not include holders of the Series W Preferred Units.  

Section 6. Voting Rights  . Holders of the Series W Preferred Units will not have any voting rights or right to consent to any matter requiring the consent or approval of the Limited Partners, except as set forth in Section 14.1 of the Partnership Agreement and in this Section 6. Solely for purposes of Section 14.1 of the Partnership Agreement, each Series W Preferred Unit shall be treated as one Partnership Unit.  

Section 7. Transfer Restrictions  . The holders of Series W Preferred Units shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 11 of the Partnership Agreement.  

Section 8. No Conversion Rights  . The holders of the Series W Preferred Units shall not have any rights to convert such units into shares of any other class or series of stock or into any other securities of, or interest in, the Partnership.  

Section 9. No Sinking Fund  . No sinking fund shall be established for the retirement or redemption of Series W Preferred Units.  

Section 10. Exhibit A to Partnership Agreement  . In order to duly reflect the issuance of the Series W Preferred Units provided for herein, the Partnership Agreement is hereby further amended pursuant to Section 12.3 of the Partnership Agreement by replacing the current form of Exhibit A to the Partnership Agreement with the form of Exhibit A that is attached to this Amendment as  

Exhibit C  .   

Section 11. Inconsistent Provisions  . Nothing to the contrary contained in the Partnership Agreement shall limit any of the rights or obligations set forth in this Amendment.
