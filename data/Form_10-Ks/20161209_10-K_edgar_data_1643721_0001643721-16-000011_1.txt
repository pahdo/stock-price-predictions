 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements.   Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 
   
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the funds we require to implement our business plan.  
   
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 16, 2014) TO JUNE 30, 2015 
   
  Revenue  
   
 During fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated $8,500 in revenue. 
   
 Operating Expenses 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we incurred total expenses of $18,565 compared to $4,607 during the period from Inception (October 16, 2014) to June 30, 2015. Total expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were comprised of $10,100 in accounting and legal expenses (2015: $4,000), amortization expenses of $743, bank charges of $326 (2015: $72), transfer agent fees of $5,825 and $1,571 in miscellaneous expenses (2015: $535).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 
   
 As of June 30, 2016, our current assets were $24,108 comprising of $24,108 in cash. We had $1,937 in equipment. Our total assets were $26,045. Our current liabilities were $10,117 comprising of an advance form related party of $3,617 and accrued expenses of $6,500. 
 Stockholders  equity was $15,928 as of June 30, 2016.   
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and for the period from Inception (October 16, 2014) to June 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were $6,322 and $1,107 respectively. 
   
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities   
   
  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and for the period from Inception (October 16, 2014) to June 30, 2015 cash flow used in investing activities were $2,680 and $0 respectively.  
   
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
   
 We have financed our operations primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and by way of loan from a shareholder.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and for the period from Inception (October 16, 2014) to June 30, 2015, net cash flows from investing activities were $28,600 and $5,617 respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, $25,600 was received from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and $3,000 from proceeds from loans from a related party. For the period from Inception (October 16, 2014) to June 30, 2015, $5,000 was received from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and $617 was received by way of loan from a related party. 
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.

 PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 
   
 We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
   
 To the Board of Directors 
 AP Event, Inc.  
   
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of AP Event, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and the related statements of operations, stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the year then ended These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of AP Event, Inc. as of June 30, 2015 were audited by other auditors whose report dated September 1, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.  
   
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
   
 In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AP Event, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and the results of its operations, stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, the company has had significant operating losses; a working capital deficiency and its need for new capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 AP EVENT INC.(the  Company ) was established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on October 16, 2014. The Company s principal office address is Husovo namesti 7, Okres Praha - Zapad, Czech Republic 25301  

Since inception the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business. The Company s primary services are as follows: delivering a touristic service to broad public. Services and products provided by our company may include custom packages according to client s specifications and travel consultation.  
   
 The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company s business plan. 
   
 The Company has adopted a June 30 fiscal year end. 
   
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s financial statements been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating expenses. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (October 16, 2014) through June 30, 2016 of $14,672. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.   
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period.

Fair Value Measurements 
         
 The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which  defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 
   
 The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
   
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
   
 Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
   
 Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
   
 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 
   
 The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  It records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. 
   
 Start-Up Costs 
   
 In accordance with ASC 720,   Start-up Costs ,  the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company. 
   
 Income taxes 
   
 The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

F-7 

15 |  Page  

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
   
 ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2016.

NOTE 6   INCOME TAX  
   
 The reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34% for the periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The Company has $14,672 of net operating losses ( NOL ) carried forward to offset taxable income in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2036. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure   controls and   procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure   controls and   procedures include, without limitation,   controls and   procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
