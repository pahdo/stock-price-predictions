  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 AP EVENT INC.(the  Company ) was established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on October 16, 2014. The Company s principal office address is Husovo namesti 7, Okres Praha - Zapad, Czech Republic 25301. 
   
 Since inception the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business. The Company s primary services are as follows: delivering a touristic service to broad public, aimed mostly at young people due to it s being specific. Services and products provided by our company may include custom packages according to client s specifications and travel consultation.  
   
 The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company s business plan. 
   
 Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto for the period ended June 30, 2016. 
   
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s financial statements been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating expenses. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (October 16, 2014) through September 30, 2016 of $14,895. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.   
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Fair Value Measurements 
         
 The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which  defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 
   
 The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
   
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
   
 Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
   
 Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
   
 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 
   
 The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  It records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. 
   
 Start-Up Costs 
   
 In accordance with ASC 720,   Start-up Costs ,  the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company. 
   
 Income taxes 
   
 The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

8 |  Page  

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
   
 ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 4   CAPTIAL STOCK  
   
 The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.  
   
 On June 8, 2015, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $5,000 to the company s founder.  
 In January and February 2016, the Company issued 1,280,000 shares at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $25,600.   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 6,280,000 shares issued and outstanding. 
   
  NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
 In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.   
   
 Since October 16, 2014 (Inception) through September 30, 2016, the Company s sole officer and director loaned the Company $3,617 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $3,617. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. 
    NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

Management has evaluated events occurring after the date of these financial statements through December 13, 2016 the date that these financial statements were available to be issued. There have been no other events that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Business  
   
 Our primary services are as follows: delivering a touristic service to broad public, aimed mostly at young people due to it s being specific. Services and products provided by our company may include custom packages according to client s specifications and travel consultation. As it grows the company is likely to take on people and expand into related markets and services. We might also look for additional leverage by establishing relationships and representations with appropriate strategic allies. 
   
 We plan to organize complex tours or offer each feature of our tours separately. A complex tour includes the following features:  
 - transfer (transportation from homeland to the point of final destination by any type of transport, local transportation, from airport/railway/bus terminal to a hotel, from a hotel to an event or attraction); 
 - admission to the music event; 
 - a guided excursion around a particular city or location 4) accommodation (regarding possible demands of our potential clients by accommodation we mean hostels or B B s) 
 - catering, for additional fee upon request; 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
   Three Months Period Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Period Ended September 30, 2015   
   
  Revenue  
   
 During the three months period ended September 30, 2015 we have generated $3,000 in revenue compared to none during the three months period ended September 30, 2016. 

10 |  Page  

Operating Expenses  
   
 During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $223 general and administrative expenses compared to $1,009 during the three months period ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. 
   
  Net Loss  
   
 Our net loss for the three months period ended September 30, 2016 was $223 compared to net income of $1,991 during the three months period ended September 30, 2015. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
   As of September 30, 2016   
   
 As at September 30, 2016 our total current assets were $25,822 compared to $26,045 in total current assets at June 30, 2016. As at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 , our current liabilities were $10,117.  
   
 Stockholders  equity was $15,705 as of September 30, 2016 compared to stockholders  equity of $15,928 as of June 30, 2016.    
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   
 We have not generated cash flows from operating activities.  
   
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities   
   
 We have nor used any cash flows in investing activities during the three months period ended September 30, 2016. 

11 |  Page  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
   
 We have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the three months period ended September 30, 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was $0.  
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
   
 MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any material commitments. 
   
 PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 
   
 We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our June 30, 2016 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
  As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.  
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure   controls and   procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure   controls and   procedures include, without limitation,   controls and   procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
   
 Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties.
