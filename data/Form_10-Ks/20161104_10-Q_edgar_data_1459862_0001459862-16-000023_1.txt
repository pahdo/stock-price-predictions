1. Organization  

The ETFS Palladium Trust (the  Trust ) is an investment trust formed on December 30, 2009   (th  e    Date of Inception )  , under New York law pursuant to a depositary trust agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) executed by ETF Securities USA LLC (the  Sponsor ) and the Bank of New York Mellon (the  Trustee ) at the time of the Trust s organization. The Trust holds palladium bullion and issues ETF  S Physical Palladium Shares (   Shares ) (in minimum blocks of   50,000   Shares, also referred to as  Baskets ) in exchange for deposits of palladium and distributes palladium in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of palladium, less the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a  Shareholder ) an opportunity to participate in the palladium market through an investment in securities. The fiscal year end for the Trust is December 31. 

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America     (   U.S. GAAP     )   for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. In the opinion of the Trust s management, all adjustments (which   consist of   normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position   and   results of operations as of and for the     three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     and for all periods presented have been made. 

These   financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.

2. Significant Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with   U.S. GAAP   requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.  

2.1. Basis of Accounting 

The Sponsor has determined that the Trust falls within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (     ASC     )   946  ,    Financial Services Investment Companies  ,   and has concluded that for reporting purposes, the Trust is classified as an Investment Company.  The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. 

2.2. Valuation of Palladium 

The Trust follows the provisions of ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements    (     ASC 820     ). ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

Palladium is held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the  Custodian ), on behalf of the Trust, at its London, England vaulting premises. Palladium may also be held by UBS A.G., or any other firm selected by the Custodian to hold the Trust s palladium in the Trust s allocated account in the firm s Zurich, Switzerland vault premises on a segregated basis and whose appointment has bee  n approved by the Sponsor (the    Zurich Sub-Custodian ).   At   September   30  , 2016, approximately   4  6  %   of the Trust s palladium was held by the Zurich Sub-Custodian. 

Palladium is recorded at fair value. The cost of palladium is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the afternoon session of the twice daily fix of an ounce of palladium administered by the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) (the  LME PM Fix ). Realized gains and losses on transfers of   palladium  , or   palladium   distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   palladium   transferred. 

Once the value of palladium has been determined, the Net Asset Value (the  NAV ) is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the  Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the palladium and all other assets held by the Trust.  

The Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in palladium as   changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment in palladium   through the Statement of Operations.  

The per Share amount of palladium exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the LME PM Fix to calculate the palladium amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering palladium sales have not yet been made, and represents the per Share amount of palladium held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred.

2.  2  .    Valuation of Palladium (continued) 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

ASC 820   establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows: 

Level 1  

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the   Trust   has the ability to access.  

Level 2  

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data.  

Level 3  

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the   Trust   s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available.  

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3. 

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The investment in palladium is classified as a level 2 asset, as the   fair value of the   Trust s investment in palladium is calculated   based upon   third party pricing sources supported by observable, verifiable inputs. 

The categorization of the Trust s assets is as shown below: 

There were   no   transfers between levels during the period   ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

2.  3  .    Palladium Receivable and Payable    

Palladium receivable or payable represents the quantity of palladium covered by contractually binding orders for the creation or redemption of Shares respectively, where the palladium has not yet been transferred to or from the Trust s account. Generally, ownership of the palladium is transferred within three business days of the trade date.

2.4. Creations and Redemptions of Shares 

The Trust expects to create and redeem Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of     50,000     S  hares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) is a participant in The Depository Trust Company, (3) has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the Sponsor, and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the Trust s Custodian or other palladium bullion clearing bank. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the palladium and any cash required for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is an unallocated palladium account, either loco London or loco Zurich, established with the Custodian or a palladium bullion clearing bank by an Authorized Participant.  

The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of palladium represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.  

Authorized Participants may, on any business day, place an order with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement period for Shares is three business days. In the event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When palladium is exchanged in settlement of redemption, it is considered a sale of palladium for financial statement purposes.  

The amount of bullion represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000  th     of an ounce. As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of bullion to be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct metal is available at all times to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management fees in the event of any shortfall or excess   on each transaction  . For each transaction, thi  s amount is not more than 1/1000  th     of an ounce.  

As the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the Outstanding Shares as Net Assets.  Changes in Shares are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 

2.  5  .    Income Taxes 

The Trust is classified as a  grantor trust  for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses will  flow through  to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust s proceeds, income, deductions, gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis. 

The Sponsor has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that   no   reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.  7  .    Expenses   / Realized Gains / Losses 

The primary expense of the Trust is the Sponsor s Fee, which is paid by the Trust through in-kind transfers of palladium to the Sponsor. 

The Trust will transfer palladium to the Sponsor to pay the Sponsor s Fee that will accrue daily at an annualized rate equal to   0.60  % of the adjusted net asset value ( ANAV ) of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. 

The Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain legal expenses. 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Sponsor s Fee was $  297,956   and $  398,004  , respectively.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   the Sponsor s Fee was   $820,446   and   $1,470,392  , respectively. 

At   September 30, 2016   and at   December 31, 2015  , the fees payable to the Sponsor were $  100,920   and $  97,509  , respectively  . 

With respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s palladium as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling palladium to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of palladium needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than palladium.  Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had   no   expenses during the     three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling palladium the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the LME PM Fix. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such palladium only if the sale transaction is made at the next LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the palladium sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale.  

Realized gains and losses result from the transfer of   palladium   for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   palladium   transferred. 

2.  8  .    Subsequent Events 

In accordance with the provisions set forth in FASB ASC 855-10,   Subsequent Events  , the Trust s management has evaluated the possibility of subsequent events   impacting   the Trust s financial statements through the filing date. During this period, no     material subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements were identified.

ETFS PALLADIUM TRUST 

Notes to the Financial Statements 

3. Related Parties  

The Sponsor and the Trustee are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee s   and Custodian s   fees   are   paid by the Sponsor and   are   not separate expense  s   of the Trust. The Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants  , and purchase or sell Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  In addition the Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time   purchase or sell palladium   directly,   for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  

4. Concentration of Risk  

The Trust s sole business activity is the investment in palladium and substantially all the Trust s assets are holdings of palladium  ,   which creates a concentration of risk associated with fluctuations in the price of palladium. Several factors could affect the price of palladium, including:   (i) global palladium supply, which is influenced by such factors as production and cost levels in majo  r palladium-producing countries; (ii) global palladium supply and demand which us influenced by factors such as   recycling, autocatalyst demand, industrial demand, jewelry demand, investment demand and sales of existing stockpiles of palladium;  (ii  i  ) currency exchange rates; (i  v) interest rates; (  v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and (v  i  ) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations.    In addition, there is no assurance that palladium will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of palladium declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trust s financial position and results of operations.  

5. Indemnification  

Under the Trust s organizational documents, the Trustee (and its directors, employees and agents) and the Sponsor (and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and affiliates) are indemnified by the Trust against any liability, cost or expense it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part and without reckless disregard on its part of its obligations and duties under the Trust s organizational documents. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

Introduction 

The Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on December 30, 2009. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. It will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool,   or   subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares. 

The Trust holds palladium and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of palladium, and to distribute palladium in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of palladium, less the Trust s expenses. The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in palladium. 

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for palladium   and   only in aggregations of 50,000 or integral multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) Arca under the symbol  PALL .  

Valuation of Palladium and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day (the  Evaluation Time ), the Trustee evaluates the palladium held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust. At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s palladium on the basis of that day s LME PM Fix or, if no LME PM Fix is made on such day, the next most recent LME PM Fix determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s palladium is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s palladium, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust s palladium or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith.  

Once the value of the palladium has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the palladium and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (the  ANAV ) of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee. 

All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets shall be calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee shall subtract from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

The Trustee s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities is conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid.

ETFS PALLADIUM TRUST 

The Quarter Ended   September 30, 2016 

The NAV of the Trust is obtained by subtracting the Trust s liabilities on any day from the value of the palladium owned and receivable by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share is obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day.

The   increase     in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from   a  n     increase   in the price per ounce of palladium, which   rose     22.58%   from $  589.00   at   June 30, 2016   to $  722.00   at   September 30, 2016  .

The Trust s NAV per Share   rose   slightly   less   than the price per ounce of palladium on a percentage basis due to   the   Sponsor s Fee, which   was    $  297,956   for the quarter, or 0.60% of the Trust s   ANAV   on an annualized basis. 

NAV   per Share of $  70.16   at   August 10, 2016   was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low of $  57.32   at   July 6, 2016  .

There was a  n     increase   in the price per ounce of palladium, which   rose     31.99%   from   $547.00   at   December 31, 2015   to   $722.00   at   September 30, 2016  .

NAV per Share of   $70.16   at   August 10, 2016   was the highest during the period  , compared with a low of   $45.33   at   January 12, 2016  .

Liquidity   Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee. 

The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s palladium as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell palladium to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of palladium to the Sponsor. At   September 30, 2016   the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
