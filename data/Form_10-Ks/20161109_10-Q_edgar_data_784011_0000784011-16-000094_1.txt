POPE RESOURCES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016    

1. 
    The condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   three- and nine-month periods   and cash flows for the   nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been prepared by Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership (the  Partnership ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited, but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. The financial information as of   December 31, 2015   is derived from the Partnership s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and notes. The results of operations for the interim periods are not indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 

2. 
    The financial statements in the Partnership s   2015   annual report on Form 10-K include a summary of significant accounting policies of the Partnership and should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
       
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Partnership is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Management has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires substantially all leases to be reflected on the balance sheet as a liability and a right-of-use asset. The ASU will replace existing lease accounting guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2019, though early application is permitted. The standard will be applied on a modified retrospective basis in which certain optional practical expedients may be applied. Due to the Partnership's limited leasing activity, management does not expect the effect of this standard to be material to its ongoing financial reporting.  
    
  The Partnership adopted ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, effective January 1, 2016.  In accordance with this standard, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Partnership's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

3. 
    The Partnership has   two   general partners: Pope MGP, Inc. and Pope EGP, Inc. In total, these two entities own   60,000   partnership units. The allocation of distributions, profits and losses among the general and limited partners is pro rata across all units outstanding. 

4. 
    ORM Timber Fund I, LP (Fund I), ORM Timber Fund II, Inc. (Fund II), and ORM Timber Fund III (REIT) Inc. (Fund III), collectively  the Funds , were formed by Olympic Resource Management LLC (ORMLLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, for the purpose of attracting capital to purchase timberlands. The objective of these Funds is to generate a return on investments through the acquisition, management, value enhancement and sale of timberland properties. Each Fund will operate for a term of   ten years   from the end of the respective investment period. Fund I sold all of its timberland holdings in 2014 and terminated in 2015. Fund II is scheduled to terminate in   March 2021   and   Fund III is scheduled to terminate in December 2025. 
       
  Pope Resources and ORMLLC together owned   20%   of Fund I, currently own   20%   of Fund II and   5%   of Fund III. The Funds are considered variable interest entities because their organizational and governance structures are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership. As the general partner or managing member of the Funds, the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of each of the Funds as it has the authority to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance, as well as the right to receive benefits and obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the Funds. Accordingly, the Funds are consolidated into the Partnership s financial statements. Additionally, the obligations of each of the Funds do not have any recourse to the Partnership. 

7 

The Partnership s condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of the Funds as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which were as follows: 

5. 
    In the presentation of the Partnership s revenue and operating income (loss) by segment, all intersegment revenue and expense is eliminated to determine operating income (loss) reported externally. The following tables reconcile internally reported income (loss) from operations to externally reported income (loss) from operations by business segment, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

6. 
    Basic and diluted earnings per unit are calculated by dividing net and comprehensive income attributable to unitholders, adjusted for non-forfeitable distributions paid out to unvested restricted unitholders and preferred shareholders of Fund II and Fund III, by the weighted average units outstanding during the period.  There were no dilutive securities outstanding during the periods presented. The following table shows the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per unit: 

7. 
    In the first quarter of   2016  , the Partnership granted   10,400   restricted units pursuant to the management incentive compensation program and   3,880   restricted units to members of the Board of Directors. These restricted units vest ratably over   four years   with the grant date fair value equal to the market price on the date of grant. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   1,360   units were granted with no restrictions to certain board members who elected to receive their quarterly board compensation in the form of units rather than cash. Units granted to directors are included in the calculation of total equity compensation expense, which is recognized over the vesting period, for restricted units, or immediately for unrestricted units. Grants to retirement-eligible individuals on the date of grant are expensed immediately. The Partnership recognized   $163,000   and   $142,000   of equity compensation expense in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $756,000   and   $722,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to these compensation programs. 

The acquisition was financed with a new   $32.0 million   credit facility issued under the existing master loan agreement with Northwest Farm Credit Services (NWFCS) and is comprised of three segments, all of which require quarterly interest-only payments with principal due at maturity. The two fixed rate loan segments are for   $11.0 million   each, one of which matures in   July 2026   and the other of which matures in   July 2028  . These segments bear interest at   3.89%   and   4.13%  , respectively. The third segment is for   $10.0 million  , matures in   July 2023   and bears interest at a variable rate based on the one-month LIBOR plus a margin of   2.20%  . As with the Partnership's other debt arrangements with NWFCS, this loan will be included in the lender's annual patronage program, which rebates a portion of the interest paid in the prior year back to the borrower. The loan is not collateralized by the timberland acquired in this transaction, but rather by the same portions of the Partnership's timberland that are already pledged as collateral for the Partnership's existing credit facility with NWFCS.  

10. 
    In   August 2016  , the Partnership entered into a   $21.0 million   loan agreement issued under the existing master loan agreement with NWFCS. This amount will remain available for the Partnership to borrow through March 31, 2017. Advances under the loan require quarterly interest-only payments with principal due at maturity in   July 2027  . Advances under the loan agreement can bear interest at a variable rate based on the one-month LIBOR plus a margin of   1.85%   (base rate loan segment) or at fixed rates based on the lender's rate pricing index, for terms of one through eleven years, plus a margin of   1.95%   (fixed rate loan segment). In addition, base rate loan segments can be converted to fixed rate loan segments, though no more than four fixed rate loan segments may be outstanding at any time. The Partnership expects to  
     
   11 

use borrowings under this facility to reduce the balance outstanding on the operating line of credit and increase the amount available to fund either Real Estate lot development, environmental remediation expenditures, or other liquidity needs. As with the Partnership's other debt arrangements with NWFCS, this loan will be included in the lender's annual patronage program, which rebates a portion the interest paid in the prior year back to the borrower. The loan is collateralized by the same portions of the Partnership's timberland that are already pledged as collateral for the Partnerships existing credit facility with NWFCS. In   October 2016  , the Partnership completed its first borrowing under this credit facility, consisting of a base rate loan segment for   $6.0 million  . 

11. 
    The Partnership s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, for which the carrying amount of each represents fair value based on current market interest rates or their short-term nature. Carrying amounts of contracts receivable, although long-term, also approximate fair value based on current market rates. 
       
  The Partnership s and the Funds  fixed-rate debt collectively have a carrying value of   $106.8 million   and   $84.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   The estimated fair value of this debt, based on current interest rates for similar instruments (Level 2 inputs in the Fair Value Hierarchy), is approximately   $115.9 million   and   $89.8 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

12. 
    The Partnership had an accrual for estimated environmental remediation costs of   $11.5 million   and   $16.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The environmental remediation liability represents management s estimate of payments to be made to monitor and remediate certain areas in and around Port Gamble Bay, Washington. 
       
  In December of 2013, a consent decree and Clean-up Action Plan (CAP) related to Port Gamble were finalized with the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) and filed with Kitsap County Superior Court. In the third quarter of 2015, the Partnership selected a contractor to complete the remediation work. Remediation activity began in late September of 2015 and will continue through 2017, followed by a period of monitoring activity. Management's cost estimates for the project are based on amounts included in the construction contract and estimates for project management and other professional fees. 
    
  The environmental liability at   September 30, 2016   is comprised of   $10.3 million   that management expects to expend in the next 12 months and   $1.2 million   thereafter. 
    
  Activity in the environmental liability is as follows: 

13. 
    In   October 2016  , the Partnership closed on two timberland acquisitions for a combined   $6.6 million   comprising   1,967   acres. The acquired timberland is adjacent to the Partnership's existing Washington State timberland holdings in Jefferson and Skamania counties.

ITEM 2. 
    
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  This report contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition, operating results, and business plans and objectives. These statements reflect management s estimates based upon our current expectations, in light of management s knowledge of existing circumstances and expectations about future developments. Statements about expectations and future performance are  forward looking statements  within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which describe our goals, objectives and anticipated performance. These statements can be identified by words such as      anticipate,   believe,   expect,   intend  and similar expressions  .     These statements are inherently uncertain, and some or all of these statements may not come to pass. Accordingly, you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take. Our future actions, as well as our actual performance, will vary from our current expectations, and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse. Some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A below. From time to time we identify other risks and uncertainties in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this report reflect our estimates and expectations as of the date of the report, and unless required by law, we do not undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change. 
    
  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included with this report.  

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership ( we  or the  Partnership ), is engaged in three primary businesses. The first, and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations, is the Fee Timber segment. This segment includes timberlands owned directly by the Partnership and operations of two private equity funds ("Fund II" and "Fund III", collectively, the  Funds ). When we refer to the timberland owned by the Partnership, we describe it as the Partnership s tree farms. We refer to timberland owned by the Funds as the Funds  tree farms. When referring collectively to the Partnership s and Funds  timberland we will refer to them as the Combined tree farms. Operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to domestic manufacturers and export brokers. The second most significant business segment in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate. Real Estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits, entitlements, and, in some cases, installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that land s value by selling larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain by either selling homes to retail buyers or lots to developers of commercial property. Since these land projects span multiple years, the Real Estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed, and will not recognize operating income until that project is sold. In addition, within this segment we sometimes negotiate and sell development rights in the form of conservation easements (CE s) on Fee Timber properties which preclude future development, but allow continued forestry operations. Our third business segment, which we refer to as Timberland Management, is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the Partnership. 
    
  Our current strategy for adding timberland acreage is centered primarily on our private equity timber fund business model. However, we will acquire smaller timberland parcels from time to time to add on to the Partnership's existing tree farms. In addition, during periods when the Funds' committed capital is fully invested, we may look to acquire larger timberland properties for the Partnership as we did in July 2016 with the acquisition of a 7,324-acre tree farm in western Washington. We have closed and invested capital from three timber funds, with assets under management totaling approximately $364 million as of   September 30, 2016   based on the most recent appraisals. Through our 20% co-investment in Fund II and our 5% co-investment in Fund III, we have deployed $26 million of Partnership capital. Our co-investment affords us a share of the Funds  operating cash flows while also allowing us to earn asset management and timberland management fees, as well as potential future incentive fees, based upon the overall success of each fund. We also believe that this strategy allows us to maintain more sophisticated expertise in timberland acquisition, valuation, and management on a more cost-effective basis than we could for the Partnership s timberlands alone. We believe our co-investment strategy also enhances our credibility with existing and prospective Fund investors by demonstrating that we have both an operational and a financial commitment to the Funds  success. 
    
  The Funds are consolidated into our financial statements, but then income or loss attributable to equity owned by third parties is eliminated from consolidated results in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income under the  
  
   13 

caption  Net and comprehensive loss attributable to non-controlling interests-ORM Timber Funds  to arrive at net and comprehensive income attributable to unitholders of the Partnership. 
    
  The strategy for our Real Estate segment centers around how and when to  harvest  a parcel of land and optimize value realization by selling the property, balancing the long-term risks and costs of carrying and developing a property against the potential for income and cash flows upon sale. Land held for development by our Real Estate segment represents property in western Washington that has been deemed suitable for residential and commercial building sites.  Land held for sale represents those properties in the development portfolio that we expect to sell in the next year. 
    
  Third quarter highlights 

The Partnership closed on the sale of two parcels of undeveloped land comprising 265 acres for $1.7 million. 
       
  Outlook 
    
  Over the course of 2016, we have made investments that will begin to pay off in the fourth quarter.  In our Fee Timber segment, we expect to realize over 40% of our annual volume in the fourth quarter.  This back-end loading of our 2016 harvest is timed to coincide with anticipated log pricing improvement.  We expect our total 2016 harvest volume to be between 96 and 100 MMBF, including timber deed sales. In our Real Estate segment, we ve invested over $10 million in our Harbor Hill project this year with the expectation of closing on the sale of up to 127 residential lots in the fourth quarter. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table reconciles and compares key revenue and cost elements that impacted our net income (loss) attributable to unitholders for the respective quarters and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The explanatory text that follows the table describes in detail certain of these changes by business segment. 
  
   14 

(A) 
    Volume variance calculated by extending change in sales volume by the average log sales price for the comparison period. 
              (B) 
    Price variance calculated by extending the change in average realized price by current period sales volume. 

15 

Fee Timber 
    
  Fee Timber results include operations on 119,000 acres of timberland owned by the Partnership and 94,000 acres of timberland owned by the Funds. Fee Timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from these timberlands which are located in western Washington, northwestern Oregon, and northern California. Revenues are driven primarily by the volume of timber harvested and the average log price realized on the sale of that timber. Our harvest volume is based typically on manufactured log sales to domestic mills and log export brokers. We also occasionally sell rights to harvest timber (timber deed sale) from the Combined tree farms. The metrics used to calculate volumes sold and average price realized during the reporting periods exclude the timber deed sales, except where stated otherwise. Harvest volumes are generally expressed in million board feet (MMBF) increments while harvest revenue and related costs are generally expressed in terms of revenue or cost per thousand board feet (MBF). 
    
  Fee Timber revenue is also derived from commercial thinning operations, ground leases for cellular communication towers, and royalties from gravel mines and quarries, all of which, along with timber deed sales, are included in other revenue below. Commercial thinning consists of the selective cutting of timber stands not yet of optimal harvest age.  However, they do have some commercial value, thus allowing us to earn revenue while at the same time improving the projected value at harvest of the remaining timber in the stand. 
    
  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

Operating Income 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q2 2016  .    Operating income increased $348,000, or 12%, from   $3.0 million   in   Q2 2016   to   $3.3 million   in   Q3 2016  . The increase is due primarily to the sale of 1.3 MMBF of timber via timber deed sales on both Partnership and Fund tree farms for $485,000 in Q3 2016 that had no counterpart in Q2 2016. A 12% decrease in harvest volume (including volume from timber deed sales) served to lower operating income, while a 2% increase in average realized log prices and a $169,000 decrease in operating expenses worked to increase operating income. 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  .    Operating income increased   $2.0 million  , or   154%  , from   $1.3 million   in   Q3 2015   to   $3.3 million   in   Q3 2016  . Our Q3 2015 results reflect a $1.1 million loss on the sale of 858 acres from Fund III's timberland, and the absence of a counterpart in our Q3 2016 results is the primary reason for the improvement in operating income. Q3 2016 includes the sale of 1.3 MMBF of timber via timber deed sales from both Partnership and Fund tree farms that had no counterpart in Q3 2015. A 3% increase in harvest volume (including volume from timber deed sales) was partially offset by a 1% decrease in average realized log prices. A $391,000 decrease in operating expenses also helped improve operating income.

Revenue 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q2 2016  .  Log sale revenue in   Q3 2016     decreased   $1.9 million  , or   16%  , from   Q2 2016   due primarily to a   19%   decrease in harvest volume, offset partially by a   2%   increase in average realized log prices. Generally, the third quarter is when log supply is at its peak, and log prices are lower, because summer weather conditions allow uninhibited access to timberlands at higher elevations. We typically reduce our harvest volume during this period in favor of harvesting greater volumes at other times in the year when log supply is more constrained and log prices are higher. We reduced our harvest volume in Q3 2016 as we expect higher log prices in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 due to this seasonal pattern. The increase in other revenue is primarily attributable to timber deed sales of $485,000 in Q3 2016 that had no counterpart in Q2 2016, as well as a $176,000 increase in revenue from road easement fees on the Partnership s Hood Canal tree farm. 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  .  Log sale revenue in   Q3 2016   decreased   $400,000  , or   4%  , from   Q3 2015  , primarily as a result of a   4%   decrease in harvest volume and a 1% decline in average realized log prices. We deferred some harvest volume in Q3 2016, particularly on Fund tree farms, as we expect higher log prices in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. The increase on other revenue was driven primarily by an increase in timber deed sales in Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015. 
     
  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Operating Income 
    
  Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  .  Operating income increased by   $1.0 million  , or   13%  , from   $7.8 million   in the first   nine months   of   2015   to   $8.8 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016  . Our 2015 results include a $1.1 million loss on sale of 858 acres from Fund III's timberland, whereas our 2016 results include a $226,000 gain on the sale of 205 acres of Fund timberland. Excluding these timberland sales, Fee Timber operating income was $8.5 million in 2016 and $8.9 million in 2015. This decrease resulted from a 5% decrease in harvest volume (including timber deed sales), a   2%   decline in average realized log prices, a $516,000 decrease in other revenue from a lack of commercial thinning activity in the current year, and a $194,000 increase in operating expenses. These factors were offset partially by a 15% decrease in cost of sales, driven by a combination of lower harvest volume and a lower average depletion rate. 
    
  Revenue 
    
  Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  .    Log sale revenue in the first nine months of   2016   decreased   $2.9 million  , or   9%  , from the first nine months of   2015  . The reduction in revenue was the result of a   7%   decrease in harvest volume and a   2%   decline in average realized log prices. Since the October 2015 expiration of the Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), Canadian lumber has been sold duty-free into the U.S. market. The combination of this duty-free entry and a weak Canadian currency has boosted Canadian exports of softwood lumber to the U.S. during the first eight months of 2016 by 34% over the corresponding period of 2015, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  The influx of Canadian lumber has played a role in keeping log prices in check when compared to last year. Other revenue declined $516,000 in the current year, primarily as a result of no commercial thinning activity, which last year produced revenue of $1.3 million.

Log Volume 
    
  We harvested the following log volumes by species from the Combined tree farms, exclusive of timber deed sales, for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  : 

Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q2 2016  . Harvest volume decreased   3.9 MMBF  , or   19%  , in   Q3 2016   from   Q2 2016  . The third quarter is generally when log supply is at its peak, and log prices are lower, because summer weather conditions afford timberland owners uninhibited access to their timberland, particularly at higher elevations. We plan for this and, to the extent we can, reduce our sales volume during the summer months in favor of harvesting greater volumes at other times in the year when log supply is more constrained and logs prices are higher.  We reduced our harvest in Q3 2016 as we expect to realize higher log prices in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 from this seasonal pattern. Our species mix shifted towards Douglas-fir and away from whitewoods in Q3 2016 compared to Q2 2016, which was primarily a function of favorable log markets for Douglas-fir for both domestic and export markets. 
    
     Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  . Harvest volume decreased   0.8 MMBF  , or   4%  , in   Q3 2016   from   Q3 2015  . The decrease is due to a 3.2 MMBF decline in harvest volume from Fund properties, offset by a 2.4 MMBF increase in volume from Partnership properties.  In addition, we sold 1.3 MMBF of volume through timber deed sales in Q3 2016, taking some of the pressure off making delivered log sales. Species mix was relatively consistent between the two quarters. 
    
  We harvested the following log volumes by species from the Combined tree farms, exclusive of timber deed sales, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  . Harvest volume decreased   3.8 MMBF  , or   7%  , in the first nine months of   2016   compared to the first   nine months   of   2015  . The decrease in harvest volume is attributable to a reduction in harvest volume from Fund properties in anticipation of better log markets later in the year and into 2017, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. In addition to the delivered log volume displayed in the above table, we sold 1.3 MMBF of volume via timber deed sales in the current year, compared to 0.6 MMBF of timber deed sales in 2015. Species mix was relatively stable between 2015 and 2016.

Log Prices 
    
  Logs from the Combined tree farms serve a number of different domestic and export markets, with domestic mills historically representing our largest market destination. Export customers consist of log brokers who sell the logs primarily to Japan, China and, to a lesser degree, Korea. 
    
  We realized the following log prices by species for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  : 

The following table compares the dollar and percentage change in log prices from each of   Q2 2016   and   Q3 2015   to   Q3 2016  : 

Overall realized log prices in   Q3 2016   were   2%   higher than   Q2 2016  . Our overall average is influenced heavily by price movements for our two most prevalent species on the Combined tree farms, Douglas-fir and whitewood, and the relative mix of harvest volume between those two species. From Q2 2016 to Q3 2016, log prices for Douglas-fir increased 6% while whitewood decreased 8%. Douglas-fir benefited from continued solid demand in the export market, which has worked through an oversupply of logs from earlier in the year. This generated upward pressure on domestic prices as manufacturers needed to compete with the export market to acquire Douglas-fir logs. A reduction in log supply from several large timber companies also helped to create pricing tension in the domestic market. Whitewood prices were down on weakness in the domestic market for that species. Prices for pine, all of which comes from Fund III s McCloud tree farm in northern California, declined 16% as Q3 2016 sales volume consisted primarily of lower-quality salvage logs whereas higher-quality logs were sold in Q2. Hardwood prices increased 23% due to the sale of higher-quality logs in Q3 2016 relative to Q2 2016. 
    
  From   Q3 2015   to   Q3 2016  , average realized log prices decreased 1%.  Species mix was largely unchanged between the two comparable quarters. Whitewood prices declined 3% and pulpwood was down 19%. The decline in pulpwood was due to an abundance of residual wood chips in the market, which decreases demand for pulpwood from which to produce chips. 

19 

The following table compares realized log prices by species for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , as well as the dollar and percentage change in log prices between the two periods: 

Overall realized log prices decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the corresponding period of 2015. The overall average is influenced heavily by Douglas-fir and whitewood prices, which were down 2% and 3%, respectively, but prices for all other species and pulpwood declined as well. Douglas-fir pricing was influenced by reduced demand in the domestic market, while whitewood was impacted by softness in the export market as well as the lower-quality log segment of the domestic market. Pine prices declined 11% due to a large supply of pine logs produced from salvage logging operations following the severe 2015 California fire season. Pulpwood prices declined 11% due to an abundance of residual wood chips in the market, reducing the demand for pulpwood from which to produce chips. 

Customers 
    
  The ultimate decision of whether to sell our logs into the export or domestic market is based on the net proceeds we receive after taking into account both the delivered log prices and the cost to deliver logs to the customer. As such, our reported log price realizations will reflect our properties  proximity to customers as well as the broader log market. 
    
  The table below categorizes logs sold by customer type for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  : 

Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q2 2016  . The relative volume sold to our various customer types changed little during Q3 2016 compared to Q2 2016. 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  . Volume sold to the export market decreased to 16% of Q3 2016 harvest volume compared to 26% of Q3 2015 volume, while volume sold to the domestic market increased to 65% of Q3 2016 harvest volume compared to 53% of Q3 2015 harvest volume. For a certain portion of our volume, the domestic and export markets compete for the same type of log. Domestic customers were paying more than export customers were offering for those logs, so we sold more volume to the domestic market. 
  
   20 

The table below categorizes logs sold by customer type for the   nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  . In the first nine months of 2016, the relative amounts of volume sold to our domestic customers has increased to 64% from 58% during the first nine months of 2015, while volume sold to export customers has decreased to 16% in the current year versus 20% last year. This shift in customer mix reflects the domestic market's continuing gradual recovery tied to the U.S. housing market, while the export market has weakened due in part to a relatively strong U.S. Dollar. Timber deed sales volume of 1.3 MMBF during the first nine months of 2016 came from the Partnership s Hood Canal tree farm and Fund III s Mashel tree farm, while the 0.6 MMBF during the first nine months of 2015 came from Fund III s Willapa tree farm. 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Fee Timber cost of sales, which consists predominantly of harvest, haul and depletion costs, vary with harvest volume. Commercial thinning costs are the primary component of other cost of sales in the tables below. 
    
  Fee Timber cost of sales for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , was as follows, with the first table expressing these costs in total dollars and the second table expressing those costs that are driven by volume on a per MBF basis: 

21 

* 
    Timber deed sale volumes are excluded in the per MBF computation for harvest, haul and tax costs but included in the per MBF computation for depletion. 
       
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q2 2016  .   Cost of sales decreased   $1.4 million  , or   20%  , in   Q3 2016   from   Q2 2016  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a 12% decline in harvest volume (including timber deed sales) and an 11% decrease in harvest, haul, and tax rates on a per MBF basis. The decrease in production cost per MBF was the result of more competitive bidding for our business by logging contractors as some of the larger landowners in our operating regions reduced their harvest operations. The decline in cost of sales would have been more pronounced if not for a 17% increase in the Combined depletion rate, resulting from the Partnership s July acquisition of the 7,324-acre Carbon River tree farm, which has been added to the Columbia tree farm. The Partnership uses a pooled depletion rate for volume harvested from the Hood Canal, Columbia, and now Carbon River tree farms. The Hood Canal and Columbia tree farms had a much lower depletion rate as they were acquired many years ago at much lower costs relative to current timberland values. Though relatively small in acreage, adding the Carbon River tree farm to the Partnership's depletion cost pool resulted in a 61% increase in the Partnership s depletion rate. 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  .   Cost of sales decreased   $748,000  , or   12%  , in   Q3 2016   from Q3   2015  , notwithstanding a 3% increase in harvest volume (including timber deed sales). This decrease is attributable to an 18% decline in the Combined depletion rate and $437,000 of cost associated with commercial thinning operations in Q3 2015 that had no counterpart in Q3 2016. Even with the increase in the Partnership s depletion rate following the July purchase of the Carbon River tree farm, the Combined depletion rate declined due to an increase in the proportion of harvest from Partnership tree farms in Q3 2016 to 67% (including timber deed sales) from 52% in Q3 2015. Conversely, the Funds  share decreased to 33% in Q3 2016 from 48% in Q3 2015. The Funds  tree farms have higher depletion rates, even after the Carbon River acquisition, because they were all purchased more recently at higher timberland valuations. 
    
  Fee Timber cost of sales for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows, with the first table expressing these costs in total dollars and the second table expressing those costs that are driven by volume on a per MBF basis: 

22 

* 
    Timber deed sale volumes are excluded in the per MBF computation for harvest, haul and tax costs but included in the per MBF computation for depletion. 
       
  Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  . Cost of sales decreased   $3.3 million  , or   15%  , in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the corresponding period in   2015   due to a 5% decrease in harvest volume (including timber deed sales), a 9% decline in the depletion rate, and $1.1 million of costs associated with commercial thinning operations in 2015 that had no counterpart in 2016. The Combined depletion rate declined due to the Partnership s relative share of 2016 harvest volume (including timber deed sales) which increased to 59% versus 50% in 2015.  Conversely, the Funds  share decreased to 41% in 2016 from 50% in 2015. The Funds  tree farms have higher depletion rates because they were purchased more recently at higher timberland valuations. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Fee Timber operating expenses include the cost of maintaining existing roads and building temporary roads for harvesting, silviculture costs, and other management expenses. For the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , operating expenses were   $2.1 million  , $2.3 million, and   $2.5 million  , respectively. The decrease in operating expenses in   Q3 2016   compared to both   Q2 2016   and Q3 2015 is attributable primarily to reduced road expenses, particularly on the Funds  tree farms. 
    
  Fee Timber operating expenses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $6.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively.  The $194,000 increase is primarily attributable to higher silviculture expenses on the Combined tree farms. 
    
  Gain (loss) on Sale of Timberland 
    
  The $226,000 gain on sale of timberland in 2016 occurred in the first quarter from sales of two parcels of timberland from Fund II s Riffe Lake tree farm and Fund III s Willapa tree farm totaling 205 acres. The total sales price for these two parcels was $774,000. The $1.1 million loss on sale of timberland in 2015 occurred in the third quarter resulting from a sale of 858 acres from Fund III's timberland. This sale occurred pursuant to a 2010 option agreement for a wind power project on a portion of the Willapa tree farm in western Washington that Fund III acquired in December 2013. The sale price under the option agreement was lower than Fund III's acquisition price for the property because the option price was based on market prices for timberland in 2010, adjusted for inflation, whereas Fund III's acquisition price was based on market prices in late 2013 and market prices appreciated much more rapidly than inflation during that time. As a result, Fund III recognized a loss on the transaction. 

Timberland Management 
    
  The Timberland Management segment develops timberland investment portfolios on behalf of the Funds. Our private equity timber funds own a combined 94,000 acres of commercial timberland in western Washington, northwestern Oregon, and northern California with total assets under management of $364 million based on the most recent appraisals. 

23 

Fund Distributions and Fees Paid to the Partnership 
    
  Fund distributions are paid from available Fund cash, generated primarily from the harvest and sale of timber after paying all Fund expenses, management fees, and recurring capital costs. The Partnership received combined distributions from the Funds of $282,000 and $862,000, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, which are eliminated in consolidation. The 2015 distributions included $622,000 from Fund I, which dissolved later that year. 
  The Partnership earned asset, investment, and timberland management fees from the Funds of   $2.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Revenue and Operating Loss 
    
  The fees earned from managing the Funds include a fixed component related to invested capital and acres owned, and a variable component related to harvest volume from the Funds  tree farms. 
    
  Revenue and operating loss for the Timberland Management segment for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  .   Timberland Management generated management fee revenue of   $772,000   and   $779,000   from managing the Funds for the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. While the decrease in revenue was only $7,000, there were a number of larger offsetting factors that produced the result. The increase in invested capital from Fund III s $50.5 million acquisition of the Mashel tree farm in Q4 2015 was offset by a downward correction to the calculation of invested capital in Q4 2015 used to determine the asset management and investment management fees, resulting in lower fees on an ongoing basis. In addition, Fund III s sale from the Willapa tree farm to Weyerhaeuser in Q3 2015 and two small timberland sales from Willapa and Fund II s Riffe Lake tree farms in Q1 2016 served to reduce invested capital and, in turn, the management fees charged to the Funds. The Mashel tree farm acquisition added 15,000 acres to Fund III, while the timberland sales removed 1,000 acres. Notwithstanding the increase in acres owned in Q3 2016 versus Q3 2015, harvest volume by the Funds declined in the current year as we elected to defer volume in expectation of better prices later in the year as the U.S. housing market continues its recovery. 
    
  Operating expenses incurred for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015   totaled   $644,000   and   $494,000  , respectively. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to costs associated with our fourth timber fund which we expect to launch by the end of 2016. 
    
  Revenue and operating loss for the Timberland Management segment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

24 

Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  . Timberland Management generated management fee revenue of   $2.4 million   from managing the Funds for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As with the quarterly results, there were a number of larger offsetting factors that resulted in management fees remaining flat from 2015 to 2016. 
    
  Operating expenses incurred by the Timberland Management segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $1.9 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively. The decrease in operating expenses is attributable to a decline in costs incurred to place capital for Fund III as the investment period closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the acquisition of the Mashel tree farm. 

Real Estate 
    
  The Partnership s Real Estate segment produces its revenue primarily from the sale of land within its 2,200-acre portfolio.  Additional sources of revenue include sales of development rights and tracts of land from the Partnership s timberland portfolio, together with residential and commercial property rents earned from our Port Gamble and Poulsbo properties. Real Estate holdings are located in the Washington counties of Pierce, Kitsap, and Jefferson with sales of land for this segment typically falling into one of three general types: 

Commercial, business park, and residential plat land sales represent land sold after development rights have been obtained and are generally sold with prescribed infrastructure improvements. 

Rural residential lot sales that generally require some capital improvements such as zoning, road building, or utility access improvements prior to completing the sale. 

The sale of unimproved land, which generally consists of larger acreage sales rather than single lot sales, is normally completed with very little capital investment prior to sale. 
       
  In addition to outright sales of fee simple interests in land, we also enter into conservation easement (CE) sales that allow us to retain the right to harvest and manage timberland, but bar any future subdivision of or real estate development on, the property. 
    
     Land Held for Development  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the Partnership s cost basis in land that has been identified as having greater value as development property than timberland. Our Real Estate segment personnel work with local officials to obtain entitlements for further development of these parcels 
    
  Those properties that are for sale, under contract, and for which the Partnership has an expectation they will sell within the next 12 months, are classified on our balance sheet as a current asset under  Land Held for Sale . The   $10.8 million   amount currently in Land Held for Sale reflects properties that are under contract and expected to close between now and the end of the third quarter of 2017, comprising 138 single-family residential lots from the Harbor Hill project and two separate single-family lot sales. 

25 

Project costs that are associated directly with the development and construction of a real estate project are capitalized and then included in cost of sales when the property is sold, along with our original basis in the underlying land and the closing costs associated with the sale transaction. 
    
  Results from Real Estate operations often vary significantly from period-to-period as we make multi-year investments in entitlements and infrastructure prior to selling entitled or developed land. 
    
  Comparing   Q3 2016   to   Q3 2015  .   In   Q3     2016  , we closed on the sale of two parcels of undeveloped land comprising 265 acres for $1.7 million. In   Q3     2015  , we closed on the sale of a parcel zoned for multi-family residential use from our Harbor Hill development. Real Estate operating expenses remained flat at $1.1 million for the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  .  These factors resulted in an operating income of   $463,000   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to operating loss of   $503,000   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
    
  Comparing YTD   2016   to YTD   2015  . In the first   nine months   of   2016  , we closed on the sale of 9 single-family residential lots from our Harbor Hill development and recognized the remaining revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis on parcels sold in previous periods for a combined total of $1.2 million as well as the sale of the two parcels of undeveloped land described above.  In the first   nine months   of   2015  , we closed on the sale of 75 residential lots from Harbor Hill for $9.0 million and on $6.0 million of conservation land and easement sales covering 3,861 acres. Rentals and other activities in our Real Estate segment have decreased in 2016 due to the loss of a tenant at our corporate headquarters building and commercial tenants at Port Gamble due to the environmental remediation project. Real Estate operating expenses increased from   $3.0 million   to   $3.3 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015   and   2016  , respectively, due primarily to legal and other professional fees in connection with planning and development for a number of properties. These factors resulted in an operating loss of   $1.7 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to operating income of   $5.2 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  . 
    
  Real Estate revenue, gross margin and operating income are summarized in the table below for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  As disclosed previously, we have a liability for environmental remediation at Port Gamble, Washington, due to contamination that occurred in Port Gamble Bay prior to our 1985 acquisition of the property from Pope   Talbot, Inc. We have adjusted that liability from time to time based on evolving circumstances. The first construction season was completed in January 2016. The second and final construction season began in late June 2016 and is expected to continue into the first half of 2017, followed by a period of monitoring activity.  
  
   26 

Project costs may still vary due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: 
  Handling of dredged material:   Our liability estimate is based on the assumption that we will be able to reuse the majority of dredged material on the millsite.  However, we have not yet obtained approval from the relevant regulatory agencies to use the millsite as a permanent location for these materials. We may be required to relocate some or all of the dredged material to land that we own a short distance from the town of Port Gamble or to a commercial landfill.  Either of these scenarios would result in an increase in costs. It is possible that the final determination of whether to reuse the material at the millsite or transfer it to an alternative location may not occur until after we complete the construction phase of the project.  As a result, if it becomes necessary to relocate the dredged material, we may incur additional expenses during the post-construction monitoring phase of the project. 
  Costs based on unit pricing:   The majority of the components of the remediation work are based on a price per unit and the number of units is an estimate.  For example, we are not certain of the number of pilings or volume of wood waste that will ultimately need to be removed from Port Gamble Bay.  The cost for this work is priced on a per piling or cubic yard basis, so to the extent the actual number of pilings or volume of wood waste to be removed changes from our estimates, the overall cost may change. 
  Unforeseen conditions:   Site conditions may be different than what was contemplated during the project design and this could result in changes to the scope of work to be completed.  For example, the Washington State Department of Ecology has required us to increase the depth of the dredging in certain areas where the depth of wood waste is greater than originally expected. 
  Natural Resource Damages (NRD):   Certain environmental laws allow state, federal, and tribal trustees (collectively, the Trustees) to bring suit against property owners to recover damages for injuries to natural resources. Like the liability that attaches to current property owners in the cleanup context, liability for natural resource damages can attach to a property owner simply because an injury to natural resources resulted from releases of hazardous substances on that owner s property, regardless of culpability for the release. The Trustees are alleging that Pope Resources has NRD liability because of releases that occurred on its property.  We have been in discussions with the Trustees regarding their claims, and the alleged conditions in Port Gamble Bay.  We have also been discussing restoration alternatives that might address the damages the Trustees allege.  Resolution of these NRD claims will likely occur after the construction phase of the project is completed. Discussions with the Trustees may result in an obligation for us to fund NRD restoration activities and past assessment costs that are not included currently in our liability. The outcome of this matter is too uncertain for us to determine the likelihood or potential amount of any such obligation at this time.  
  Should any future circumstances result in a change to the estimated cost of the project, we will record an appropriate adjustment to the liability in the period it becomes known and we can reasonably estimate the amount. 

General and Administrative (G A) 
    
  G A expenses remained flat at   $1.2 million   in the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  . G A expenses increased to   $3.8 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   from   $3.6 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  . The increase in G A expenses on a year-to-date basis was due primarily to personnel costs for being fully staffed in 2016 relative to 2015 and higher incentive compensation expense in 2016. 

Interest Expense, Net 

The Partnership s and Fund III s debt arrangements with Northwest Farm Credit Services (NWFCS) are included in its patronage program, which rebates a portion of interest paid in the prior year back to the borrower. This NWFCS patronage  
  
   27 

program is a feature common to most of this lender s loan agreements.  The patronage program reduced interest expense by $190,000 and $120,000 for the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and by $585,000 and $358,000 for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest expense on a quarterly basis is due to the higher debt balances, primarily in the third quarter, offset partially by a higher patronage rebate in 2016 relative to 2015. Interest expense remained relatively flat on a year-to-date basis as the increase in our debt balances did not occur until the third quarter of 2016 and was was offset by the higher patronage rebate in 2016. 
  Capitalized interest decreased from 2015 to 2016 on both a quarterly and year-to-date basis due to the reduction in basis from 2015 completed construction activity at Harbor Hill. 

Income Tax 
    
  The Partnership recorded income tax expense of   $116,000   and   $1,000   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $166,000   and   $369,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Pope Resources is a limited partnership and is therefore not subject to federal income tax. Taxable income/loss is instead reported to unitholders each year on a Form K-1 for inclusion in each unitholder s income tax return. However, Pope Resources does have corporate subsidiaries that are subject to income tax, giving rise to the line item for such tax in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 

Noncontrolling interests-ORM Timber Funds 
    
  The line item  Net and comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests-ORM Timber Funds  represents the combination of the 80% portion of the net income or loss for Fund II which is attributable to third-party owners plus 95% of the net income or loss of Fund III that is similarly attributable to third-party owners. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We ordinarily finance our business activities using operating cash flows and, where appropriate in management s assessment, commercial credit arrangements with banks or other financial institutions. During periods of reduced operating cash flows, such as the first nine months of 2016, we have available to us a line of credit that can be accessed in order to provide for liquidity needs. We expect that funds generated internally from operations and externally through financing will provide the required resources for the Partnership s operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  The Partnership s debt consists of mortgage debt with fixed and variable interest rate tranches and an operating line of credit with Northwest Farm Credit Services (NWFCS). The mortgage debt at   September 30, 2016   includes $56.8 million in term loans with NWFCS structured in six tranches that mature from 2017 through 2028 and is collateralized by portions of the Partnership's timberland. In addition, our commercial office building in Poulsbo, Washington is collateral for a $2.6 million loan from NWFCS that matures in 2023. We also have available, through March 31, 2017, a $21.0 million facility with NWFCS that will mature in 2027.  At September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. Our $20.0 million operating line of credit matures April 1, 2020 and we had $17.3 million drawn as of   September 30, 2016  . The line of credit carries a variable interest rate that is based on the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.5%. 
    
  These debt agreements contain covenants that are measured quarterly. Among the covenants measured is a requirement that the Partnership maintain an interest coverage ratio of 3:1 and not exceed a maximum debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 30%, with total capitalization calculated using fair market (vs. carrying) value of timberland, roads and timber. The Partnership is in compliance with these covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and expects to remain in compliance for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  Mortgage debt within our private equity timber funds are collateralized by Fund properties only. Fund II has a timberland mortgage comprised of two fixed rate tranches totaling $25.0 million with MetLife Insurance Company. The tranches are non-amortizing and both mature in September 2020.  The loans allow for, but do not require, annual principal payments of up to 10% of outstanding principal without incurring a make-whole premium. This mortgage is collateralized by a portion of Fund II s timberland portfolio.  Fund III has a timberland mortgage comprised of two fixed rate tranches totaling  
  
   28 

$32.4 million with NWFCS.  The mortgage is non-amortizing and collateralized by all of Fund III s timberland, with an $18.0 million tranche maturing in December 2023 and a $14.4 million tranche maturing in October 2024. 
    
  The   $617,000   decrease in cash generated for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   is explained in the following table: 

The decrease in cash provided by (used in) operating activities of   $25.9 million   resulted primarily from fewer Real Estate sales in 2016, a $3.7 million increase in environmental remediation expenditures, a   7%   decrease in timber harvest volume, and a   2%   decrease in log prices. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities during   2016   increased by   $29.5 million   compared to   2015   due primarily to the increase in Partnership timberland acquisitions in 2016.  
    
  Cash provided by financing activities increased in the current year by   $54.8 million   due primarily to a debt-financed timberland acquisition in third quarter of 2016, increased borrowings on our operating line of credit, and an increase in distributions to Pope Resources' unitholders. This was offset partially by the repayment of mortgage debt at its maturity in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease in distributions to investors in our private equity timber funds.  

Seasonality 
    
  Fee Timber.    The elevation and terrain characteristics of our timberlands are such that we can conduct harvest operations virtually year-round on a significant portion of our tree farms.  Generally, we concentrate our harvests from these areas in those months when weather limits operations on other properties, thus taking advantage of reduced competition for log supply to our customers and improving prices realized. As such, on a combined basis the pattern of quarterly volumes harvested is flatter than would be the case if looking at one tree farm in isolation. However, this pattern may not hold true during periods of comparatively soft log prices, when we may defer harvest volume to capture greater value when log prices strengthen. 

29 

Timberland Management.   Management revenue generated by this segment consists of asset and timberland management fees. These fees, which relate primarily to our activities on behalf of the Funds and are eliminated in consolidation, vary based upon the amount of invested capital, the number of acres owned by the Funds, and the volume of timber harvested from properties owned by the Funds and are not expected to be significantly seasonal. 
    
  Real Estate.   While Real Estate results are not expected to be seasonal, the nature of the activities in this segment will likely result in periodic large transactions that will have significant positive impacts on both revenue and operating income of the Partnership in periods in which these transactions close, and relatively limited revenue and income in other periods. While the variability of these results is not primarily a function of seasonal weather patterns, we do expect to see some seasonal fluctuations in this segment because of the general effects of weather on Pacific Northwest development activities. 

Capital Expenditures and Commitments 
    
  Capital expenditures, excluding timberland acquisitions, for the full year   2016   are projected to be approximately $18.8 million. The most significant expenditures relate to finishing residential lots for sale to merchant homebuilders in our Harbor Hill project in the fourth quarter and the installation of a new wastewater treatment plant for the town of Port Gamble. The following table presents our capital expenditures by major category on a year-to-date basis and what we expect for the remainder of the year: 

ACCOUNTING MATTERS 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  An accounting policy is deemed to be  critical  if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Management believes its most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the calculation of timber depletion as well as modeling performed to determine liabilities for matters such as environmental remediation, and potential asset impairments. 
    
  For a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates see Accounting Matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . See also note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The consolidated fixed-rate debt outstanding had a fair value of approximately   $115.9 million   and   $89.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on the prevailing interest rates for similar financial instruments. A change in interest rate on fixed-rate debt will affect the fair value of debt, whereas a change in the interest rate on variable-rate debt will affect interest expense and cash flows payable by the Partnership. A hypothetical 1% change in prevailing interest rates would change the fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt obligations by $3.7 million and result in a $273,000 change in interest expense from our variable-rate date. We are not subject to material foreign currency risk, derivative risk, or similar uncertainties. 

30 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  The Partnership s management maintains a system of internal controls, which management views as adequate to promote the timely identification and reporting of material, relevant information. Those controls include (1) requiring executive management and all managers in accounting roles to sign and adhere to a Code of Conduct and (2) implementation of a confidential hotline for employees to contact the Audit Committee directly with financial reporting concerns. Additionally, the Partnership s senior management team meets regularly to discuss significant transactions and events affecting the Partnership s operations. The Partnership s executive officers lead these meetings and consider whether topics discussed represent information that should be disclosed under generally accepted accounting principles and the rules of the SEC. The Board of Directors of the Partnership s general partner includes an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the earnings release and all reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K prior to their filing. The Audit Committee is responsible for hiring the Partnership s external auditors and meets with those auditors at least eight times each year, including regularly scheduled executive sessions outside the presence of management. 
    
  Our executive officers are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures. They have designed such controls to ensure that others make all material information known to them within the organization. Management regularly evaluates ways to improve internal controls. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q our executive officers completed an evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures and have determined them to be effective. There have been no changes to internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

31 

PART II- OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  From time to time, the Partnership may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that may have a material adverse impact on its business. Management is not aware of any current legal proceedings or claims that are expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on its business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Markets 
    
  We are sensitive to demand and price issues relating to our sales of logs in both domestic and foreign markets.   We generate Fee Timber revenue primarily by selling softwood logs to domestic mills and to third-party intermediaries who resell them to the export market. The domestic market for logs in our operating area depends heavily on U.S. housing starts. Recently, the U.S. housing market has started to improve but, to the extent the recovery in the housing market should stall, such a turn of events could have a negative impact on our operating results. For example, interest rates are widely expected to rise in the coming periods. Should this occur, it could have a negative impact on the U.S. housing market. Demand from export markets for Pacific Northwest logs are affected significantly by fluctuations in United States, Japanese and, increasingly, Chinese and Korean economies, the foreign currency exchange rate between these Asian currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as by ocean transportation costs. Further, the prices we realize for our logs depend in part upon competition, and the October 2015 expiration of the Softwood Lumber Agreement between the United States and Canada, combined with a weak Canadian currency, has had the effect of increasing the supply of logs from Canada to the U.S., exerting downward pressure on log prices. 
    
  Our Fee Timber and Timberland Management segments are highly dependent upon sales of commodity products.   Our revenues from our forestry businesses, which comprise our Fee Timber and our Timberland Management segments, are widely available from producers in other regions of the United States and in a number of other countries. We are therefore subject to risks associated with the production of commonly available products, such that an increase in supply from abroad as a result of overproduction by competitors in other nations or as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, may reduce the demand for our products in some or all of the markets in which we do business. Similarly, from time to time in the past we have seen, and in the future we may experience, an increase in supply or a reduction in demand as a result of international tensions or competition that are beyond our control and that may not be predictable. 
    
  We are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions that currently limit, and may increasingly limit, our ability to generate income.   Our ability to grow and harvest timber can be impacted significantly by legislation, regulations or court rulings that restrict or stop forest practices. For example, events that focus media attention upon natural disasters and damage to timberlands have at various times brought increasing public attention to forestry practices. Similarly, certain activist groups in Oregon have proposed a ballot initiative that, if approved and sustained in the courts, would eliminate clearcutting, which is the predominant harvest practice across our geographic region.  These initiatives, alone or in combination, may limit the portion of our timberlands that is eligible for harvest, may make it more expensive or less efficient to harvest all or certain portions of our timberlands, or may restrict other aspects of our operations. Additional regulations, whether or not adopted in response to such events, may make it more difficult or expensive for us to harvest timber and may reduce the amount of harvestable timber on our properties. These and other restrictions on logging, planting, road building, fertilizing, managing competing vegetation, and other activities can significantly increase the cost or reduce available inventory thereby reducing income. Any such additional restrictions would likely have a similar effect on our Timberland Management operations. We cannot offer assurances that we will not be alleged to have failed to comply with these regulations, or we may face a reduction in revenues or an increase in costs as a result of complying with newly adopted statutes, regulations and court or administrative decisions. These claims may take the form of individual or class action litigation, regulatory or enforcement proceedings, or both. Any such claims could result in substantial defense costs and divert management s attention from the ongoing operation of our business, and if any such claims were successful, may result in substantial damage awards, fines or civil penalties. 
    
  Environmental and other activist groups may have an adverse impact on the value of our assets or on our ability to generate revenues from our timberlands.   In recent years we have seen an increase in activities by environmental groups, Native American tribes, and other activists in the legislative, administrative and judicial processes that govern all aspects of our operations. For example, on more than one occasion the Washington Department of Ecology applied more stringent regulatory standards to our existing environmental remediation operations at Port Gamble, Washington, after soliciting or receiving input from tribal representatives. These revisions substantially increased the cost and the time associated  
  
   32 

with our previously-existing remediation plans. Similarly, citizens  and environmental groups have significant influence in the entitlement and zoning processes that affect our Real Estate operations. These activities are not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future, and in some instances may have a material impact upon the revenues we can generate from our properties or upon the costs of generating those revenues. 
    
  Our businesses are highly dependent upon domestic and international macroeconomic factors.   Both our timberland operations and our real estate operations are highly influenced by housing markets. Our Fee Timber and Timberland Management segments depend upon housing and construction markets in the United States and in other Pacific Rim countries. Our Real Estate segment depends upon a highly localized demand in the Puget Sound region of Western Washington. Factors that affect these markets will have a disproportionate impact on our business, and may be difficult or impossible to predict or estimate accurately. 
    
  We face increasing competition from engineered and recycled products.   Our Fee Timber and Timberland Management segments derive substantially all their revenues from the market for softwood logs and wood products derived from them.  Recent years have witnessed the emergence of plastic, fiberglass, wood composite and recycled products, as well as metal products in certain industries, that may have the effect of reducing demand for our products. As these products evolve, and as other competitive products may be developed, we may face a decline in log price realizations that would have an adverse impact on our revenues, our earnings and the value of our assets. 
    
  As a property owner and seller, we face environmental risks associated with events that occur or that may be alleged to have occurred on our properties.   Various federal and state environmental laws in the states in which we operate place liability for environmental contamination on the current and former owners of real estate on which contamination is discovered. These laws are often a source of  strict liability,  meaning that an owner or operator need not necessarily have caused, or even been aware of, the release of hazardous substances. Such a circumstance applies to our operations at Port Gamble and Port Ludlow, Washington, for example, where contamination occurred prior to the formation of the Partnership. If hazardous substances are discovered or are alleged to have been released on property that we currently own or operate, that we have owned or operated in the past, or that we acquire or operate in the future, we may be subject to liability for the cost of remediating these properties without regard for our conduct or our knowledge of the events that led to the contamination or alleged contamination. These events would likely increase our expenses and might, in some cases, make it more difficult or impossible for us to continue operating our timberlands or to sell parcels of real estate for a price we would deem reasonable, or at all. 
    
  Risks Relating to Our Operations 
    
  Our operations are geographically concentrated, and we may face greater impacts from localized events than would more geographically diverse timber companies.   Because our operations are conducted exclusively west of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, between northern California and the Canadian border, regionalized events and conditions may have a more pronounced impact upon our operations than they might upon a more geographically diverse timber company. For example, disease and insect infestations tend to be local or regional in scope, and because our Fee Timber and Timberland Management businesses are geographically concentrated, events of this nature may affect our operations more significantly than they might a similarly situated company whose operations are more widely dispersed. Similarly, because the vast majority of our Real Estate operations are limited to the Puget Sound region of Western Washington, regional impacts such as growth patterns, weather patterns and natural disasters, as well as socio-political events such as environmental and land use initiatives, may disproportionately affect that segment more significantly than a company whose operations are less concentrated. 
    
  Consolidation of sawmills in our geographic operating area may reduce competition among our customers, which could adversely affect our log prices.   In the past we have experienced, and may continue to experience, consolidation of sawmills and other wood products manufacturing facilities in the Pacific Northwest. For example, Simpson Timber Co. announced in 2015 the sale of four of their mills in the Pacific Northwest region to two separate buyers. Two of those mills will be shut down permanently while another will be closed until a new, more modern, mill is built in its place. The replacement mill is expected to open in late 2016 or early 2017. In addition, Interfor announced recently their intention to sell a lumber mill in Tacoma, Washington that it closed in May 2015. Because a portion of our cost of sales in our Fee Timber segment, which encompasses the Combined tree farms, consists of transportation costs for delivery of logs to domestic sawmills, it becomes increasingly expensive to transport logs over longer distances for sales in domestic markets. As a result, a reduction in the number of sawmills, or in the number of sawmill operators, may reduce competition for our logs, increase transportation costs, or both. These consolidations thus may have a material adverse impact upon our Fee Timber revenue or income and, as that segment has traditionally represented our largest business unit, upon our results of operation and financial condition as a whole. Any such material adverse impact on timber revenue and income as a result of regional mill consolidations will also indirectly  
  
   33 

affect our Timberland Management segment in the context of raising capital for investment in Pacific Northwest-based timber funds. 
  We have increased our leverage in recent periods, which may give rise to additional risks that have not historically accompanied our operations.   As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, we have recently increased the Partnership's leverage and its borrowing capacity to expand our timberland holdings and invest in our Real Estate operations. The Partnership's total outstanding debt was $76.5 million at September 30, 2016, of which $27.3 million bears interest at variable rates with the balance at fixed rates. The increase in debt, particularly that portion that carries variable interest rates, exposes us to certain additional risks, including the possibility that we may face additional interest expense, particularly in an economic environment that includes rising interest rates, as are widely expected in the United States in coming periods. In addition, generally speaking, an increase in our indebtedness may limit our ability to defer timber harvests and potentially restricts our flexibility to take advantage of other investment opportunities that might otherwise benefit our business. In extreme cases, we could be placed in a position in which we default under one or more of our credit arrangements, which could require us to pledge additional portions of our timberland as collateral for our indebtedness or which might require us to take other actions or expose us to other remedies that could have a material adverse effect upon our assets, operations or business. 
    
  Our real estate holdings are highly illiquid, and changes in economic and regulatory factors may affect the value of our properties or the timing of the proceeds, if any, that we expect to receive on the sale of such properties.   The value of our real estate investments, and our income from Real Estate operations, is sensitive to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, as well as various land-use regulations and development risks, including the ability to obtain the necessary permits and land entitlements that would allow us to maximize the revenue from our real estate investments. Our real estate investments are long-term in nature, which raises the risk that unforeseen changes in the economy or laws surrounding development activities may have an adverse effect on our investments. These investments often are highly illiquid and thus may not generate cash flow if and when needed to support our other operations. Further, we occasionally announce contracts relating to the sale of our real estate holdings, but those agreements may contain contingencies and conditions that may delay or prevent the consummation of transactions even after we have agreed to sale terms. 
    
  Our timber investment fund business depends upon establishing and maintaining a strong reputation among investors, and on our ability to maintain strong relationships with existing and prospective investors in our Funds.   Our ability to expand our operations using our private equity timber fund strategy depends to a significant degree upon our ability to maintain and develop our expertise in managing timberlands in a manner that generates investment returns for prospective Fund investors. Events or conditions that adversely impact this capacity, including events that damage our reputation or our relationship with Fund investors, may make it more difficult to grow our operations using this strategy, and in some instances may result in actual or alleged liability to our investors. Any such events may cause a reduction in our revenues or may cause us to realize less than the optimum potential of our assets. 
    
  We have an environmental     remediation liability     associated with our Port Gamble property, and     that liability may increase.   We currently own certain real estate at Port Gamble on the Kitsap Peninsula in western Washington. Sediments adjacent to the property were alleged to have been impacted by operations occurring prior to our acquisition of the property, which occurred at the time of our spinoff from Pope   Talbot, Inc. in 1985. However, as current owner of Port Gamble, we have environmental liability for these properties under Washington State s Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA). In December 2013, we reached an agreement with the Washington State Department of Ecology ( DOE ) in the form of a consent decree ( CD ) and clean-up action plan ( CAP ) that provides for the cleanup of Port Gamble Bay. Together, these documents outline the terms under which the Partnership will conduct environmental remediation as well as the specific clean-up activities to be performed. The CD and CAP were filed with the Kitsap County Superior Court in December 2013.  On June 8, 2015, Kitsap County Superior Court ruled on summary judgment that Washington s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) did not qualify as an owner or operator of the site and therefore did not have liability under the MTCA. DNR had been identified by DOE as a "potentially liable person" under the MTCA. The effect of the court s ruling is to absolve DNR of any responsibility to contribute to the cost of cleanup at Port Gamble. We have appealed the Superior Court s ruling, and believe we have a strong case for overturning the lower court s decision, however, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in this matter or that we can reach an acceptable settlement with DNR.  The recorded liability reflects the estimated cost of the entire project, without any contribution by DNR. Additionally, certain environmental laws allow state, federal, and tribal trustees (collectively, the Trustees) to bring suit against property owners to recover damages for injuries to natural resources. Like the liability that attaches to current property owners in the cleanup context, liability for natural resource damages can attach to a property owner simply because an injury to natural resources resulted from releases of hazardous substances on that owner s property, regardless of culpability for the release. The Trustees are alleging that Pope Resources has NRD liability because of releases that occurred on its property.  We have been in discussions with the Trustees regarding their claims, and the alleged conditions in Port Gamble Bay.  We have also been discussing restoration alternatives that might address the damages the Trustees allege. Discussions with the Trustees may result in an obligation for us to fund NRD assessment and restoration activities that are not  
  
   34 

included currently in our liability. The outcome of this matter is too uncertain for us to determine the likelihood or potential amount of any such obligation at this time. 
    
  Management continues to monitor the Port Gamble cleanup processes closely. The $  11.5 million   remediation accrual as of   September 30, 2016   represents our current estimate of the remaining cleanup cost and most likely outcome to various contingencies. These estimates are predicated upon a variety of factors, including the actual amount of the ultimate cleanup costs. The liability is based upon a number of estimates and judgments that are subject to change as the project progresses. There may be additional litigation costs if we successfully overturn the Superior Court's ruling but cannot reach a settlement with DNR, and the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. The filing of the CD limits our legal exposure for matters covered by the decree, but does not eliminate it entirely. DOE reserves the right to reopen the CD if new information regarding factors previously unknown to the agency requires further remedial action. While unlikely, a reopening of the CD may result in adverse financial impacts and may have the effect of distracting management and other key personnel from the day to day operation of our business. These factors, alone or in combination with other challenges, may have a material adverse effect upon our assets, income and operations. 
    
  We compete with a number of larger competitors that may be better able than we to absorb price fluctuations, may be able to expend greater resources on production, may have greater access to capital, and may operate more efficiently than we can.   We compete against much larger companies in each of our business segments. We compete with these companies for management and line personnel, as well as for purchases of relatively scarce capital assets such as land and standing timber and for sales of our products. These larger competitors may have access to larger amounts of capital and significantly greater economies of scale, and they may be better able to absorb the risks inherent in our line of business. Moreover, the timber industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and, as that consolidation occurs, our relative market share decreases and the relative financial capacity of our competitors increases. While management believes the Partnership is at a competitive advantage over some of these companies because of our lack of vertical integration into forest products manufacturing, our advantageous tax structure, and management s attempts to diversify our asset base, we cannot assure readers that competition will not have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition. 
    
  We and our customers are dependent upon active credit markets to fund operations.   We sell logs from our Fee Timber segment to mills and log brokers that in most circumstances rely upon an active credit market to fund their operations. Our Real Estate sales are also often dependent upon credit markets in order to fund acquisitions. To the extent borrowing restrictions impinge on customers  access to debt, we expect those customers to respond by reducing their expenditures, and those reductions may have the effect of directly reducing our revenues and of indirectly reducing the demand for our products. Any such outcomes could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
    
  We may incur losses as a result of natural disasters that may occur, or that may be alleged to have occurred, on our properties.   Forests are subject to a number of natural hazards, including damage by fire, severe windstorms, insects and disease, flooding and landslides. Changes in global climate conditions may intensify these natural hazards. Severe weather conditions and other natural disasters can also reduce the productivity of timberlands and disrupt the harvesting and delivery of forest products. While damage from natural causes is typically localized and would normally affect only a small portion of our timberlands at any one time, these hazards are unpredictable and losses might not be so limited. Consistent with the practices of other large timber companies, we do not maintain insurance against loss of standing timber on our timberlands due to natural disasters. However, as a result of the extreme fire conditions in the Pacific Northwest in 2015, we have acquired fire insurance on a portion of our timberland portfolio. 
    
  We rely on contract loggers and truckers who are in short supply and seeking consistent work at increasing rates.    We rely on contract loggers and truckers for the production and transportation, respectively, of our products to customers.     The pool of available contractors is limited and can result in an increase in harvest and haul costs as harvest volume increases.  In addition, contractors may emphasize continuity of work which influences contractor selection and solicitation of contractor bids for jobs.  The commitment to more continuous work could reduce our flexibility to time markets, affecting total returns.

Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities 
    
  We are controlled by our managing general partner.   As a master limited partnership, substantially all of our day-to-day affairs are controlled by our managing general partner, Pope MGP, Inc. The board of directors of Pope MGP, Inc. serves as our board of directors, and by virtue of a stockholder agreement, each of the two individual shareholders of Pope MGP, Inc. have the ability to designate one of our directors and jointly appoint two others, with the fifth board position taken by our chief executive officer, who serves as a director by virtue of his executive position. Unitholders may remove the managing general partner only in limited circumstances, including, among other things, a vote by the holders of a two-thirds majority of the  qualified units,  which means the units that have been owned by their respective holders for at least five years prior to such vote. By virtue of the terms of our agreement of limited partnership, as amended, or  partnership agreement , our managing general partner directly, and the general partner shareholders indirectly, have the ability to do the following: prevent or impede transactions that would result in a change of control of the Partnership; to prevent or, upon the approval of limited partners holding a majority of the units, to cause, the sale of the assets of the Partnership; and to cause the Partnership to take or refrain from taking certain other actions that one might otherwise perceive to be in the Partnership s best interest. Under our partnership agreement, we are required to pay to Pope MGP, Inc. an annual management fee of $150,000, and to reimburse Pope MGP, Inc. for certain expenses incurred in managing our business. 
    
  We have a limited market capitalization and a relatively low historic trading volume, as a result of which the trading prices of our units may be more volatile than would an investment in a more liquid security.   Our relatively small public float and our limited trading volume may, in certain instances, make trading in our units more volatile, as a result of which our price may deviate more significantly, and opportunities to buy or sell our units may be more limited, than investors might experience with a more liquid market. This circumstance may be magnified during times of significant or prolonged selling pressure on our securities. 
    
  We benefit from certain tax treatment accorded to master limited partnerships, and if that status changes the holders of our units may realize less advantageous tax consequences  . The Partnership is a Master Limited Partnership and is therefore not generally subject to U.S. federal income taxes. If a change in tax law (or interpretation of current tax law) caused the Partnership to become subject to income taxes, operating results would be adversely affected. We also have a handful of taxable subsidiaries. The estimation of income tax expense and preparation of income tax returns requires complex calculations and judgments. We believe the estimates and calculations used in this process are proper and reasonable and more likely than not would be sustained under examination by federal or state tax authorities, however if a federal or state taxing authority disagreed with the positions we have taken, a material change in provision for income taxes, net income, or cash flows could result.

  8.02.          Notice and Opportunity to Cure  .    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents, Lender shall not accelerate the maturity of a Loan (a) because of a monetary default (defined below), unless the monetary default is not cured within ten days of its due date, or (b) because of a nonmonetary default (defined below), unless the nonmonetary default is not cured within 30 days after (i) the date on which Lender transmits by facsimile, mails or delivers written notice of the nonmonetary default to Borrower, or (ii) the date on which Borrower notifies Lender (verbally or in writing) of the nonmonetary default.

c.        Prepayment Fee  .  The    Prepayment Fee    is an amount intended to reasonably compensate Lender for the loss of the intended benefit of Lender s bargain in the case of a prepayment.  Borrower and Lender intend that the principal balance of each Loan Segment will yield to Lender an annual return after the date the Loan Segment is prepaid of not less than the annual return for the period when the interest rate is fixed.  In the event of a prepayment, Lender will lose the intended benefit of its bargain.  Accordingly, the Prepayment Fee is intended to reasonably compensate Lender for such loss and costs.  The Prepayment Fee shall be payable on demand, and shall be an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology. 
  9.02.          Breakage Fee  .    In the event of an occurrence under subparagraphs a. or b. below, then Borrower shall immediately pay Lender, on demand, a    Breakage Fee    in an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology: 
  a.        Borrower provides Lender Notice that Loan principal is to be priced using a Fixed Rate Option, after which Borrower revokes such Notice; or 
  b.        Borrower provides Lender Notice that Loan principal priced under a Fixed Rate Option is to be repriced or prepaid on other than a Pricing Date, after which Borrower revokes such Notice or fails to prepay pursuant to the Notice. 
  9.03.          Participation  .    Participant(s), if any, may calculate a Prepayment Fee or Breakage Fee on a make-whole basis using a different methodology than Lender. 
  10.        Enforcement and Waiver; Indemnity. 
  10.01.          Enforcement and Waiver by Lender  .    Lender shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of the Loan Documents in strict accordance with the terms thereof, notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of Lender in refraining from so doing at any time or times.  The failure of Lender at any time or times to enforce its rights under such provisions, strictly in accordance with the same, shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to specific provisions or as having in any way or manner modified or waived the same.  All rights and remedies of Lender are cumulative and concurrent, and the exercise of one right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any other right or remedy.  Lender shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies given it by the Loan Documents, all rights and remedies allowed by all applicable Laws and in equity. 
  10.02.          Lender s Expenses; Indemnity; Waiver of Damages by Borrower  .   
  a.        Expenses  .

  b.        Indemnification by Borrower  .  Borrower shall indemnify Lender and each Related Party of Lender (each such Person being called an    Indemnitee   ) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by Borrower or any other party hereto arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations or the consummation of the transactions contemplated, (ii) any actual or alleged presence or release of hazardous materials on or from any Property owned or operated by Borrower, or any environmental liability related in any way to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by Borrower or any other party hereto, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;   provided   that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by Borrower or any other party hereto against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if Borrower or such party hereto has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Provided however, in the course of any proceeding of any nature contemplated by this subsection between or among Indemnitee, Borrower or any party hereto, each such party shall be responsible for their own fees and expenses, provided further, that following a nonappealable judgment, the prevailing party or substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to payment of its reasonable costs and expenses from the other party or parties. 
  c.        Waiver by Borrower of Consequential Damages, Etc.    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Borrower shall not assert, and each such party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated, the transactions contemplated, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Borrower and Lender intend that the principal balance of each Loan Segment will yield to Lender an annual return after the date the Loan Segment is prepaid of not less than the annual return for the period when the interest rate is fixed. In the event of a prepayment, Lender will lose the intended benefit of its bargain. Accordingly, the Prepayment Fee is intended to reasonably compensate Lender for such loss and costs. The Prepayment Fee shall be payable, on demand, and shall be an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology. 
  9.02        Breakage Fee  . In the event of an occurrence under subparagraphs a, or b, below, then Borrower shall immediately pay Lender, on demand, a  Breakage Fee  in an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology: 
  (a)        Borrower provides Lender Notice that Loan principal is to be priced using a Fixed Rate Option, after which Borrower revokes such Notice; or 
  (b)        Borrower provides Lender Notice that Loan principal priced under a Fixed Rate Option is to be repriced or prepaid on other than a Pricing Date, after which Borrower revokes such Notice or fails to prepay pursuant to the Notice. 
  9.03        Participation  .     Participant(s), if any, may calculate a Prepayment Fee or Breakage Fee on a make-whole basis, using a different methodology than Lender. 
  10.        Enforcement and Waiver; Indemnity  . 
  10.01        Enforcement and Waiver by Lender  . Lender shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of the Loan Documents in strict accordance with the terms thereof, notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of Lender in refraining from so doing at any time or times. The failure of Lender at any time or times to enforce its rights under such provisions, strictly in accordance with the same, shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to specific provisions or as having in any way or manner modified or waived the same. All rights and remedies of Lender are cumulative and concurrent, and the exercise of one right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any other right or remedy. Lender shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies given it by the Loan Documents, all rights and remedies allowed by all applicable Laws and in equity. 
  10.02        Lender s Expenses; Indemnity; Waiver of Damages by Borrower  .  
  (a)        Expenses  .

  (b)        Indemnification by Borrower  .

Provided however, in the course of any proceeding of any nature contemplated by this subsection between or among Indemnitee, Borrower or any party hereto, each such party shall be responsible for their own fees and expenses, provided further, that following a nonappealable judgment, the prevailing party or substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to payment of its reasonable costs and expenses from the other party or parties. 
  (c)        Waiver by Borrower of Consequential Damages, Etc  .  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Borrower shall not assert, and each such party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this

  3.06      Security Interest  .      Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first lien security interest in any FPF Account established or to be established by or on behalf of Borrower related to the Loan.

  13 

4.02      1-, 3-, 5-, 7- or 10-Year Fixed Rate Options  .    Borrower understands and agrees that the availability of any Fixed Rate Option will be determined at Lender s (and participant s, if applicable) sole discretion.  Subject to the preceding sentence, a Fixed Rate Loan Segment may be priced with a fixed rate equal to the 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- or 10-year Fixed Rate Options, as defined herein, plus the Applicable Margin.  With these Fixed Rate Options, (a) rates may be fixed for Interest Periods, as defined herein, of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years; and (b) rates may only be fixed on a Pricing Date to take effect on such Pricing Date.  For purposes hereof:  (i) the  1-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-year Fixed Rate Options  shall mean the rate for the all-in cost of the corresponding term for Farm Credit Medium Term Notes, rounded to the nearest .05 percent, as made available by the Index Source on the Pricing Date; and (ii)  Interest Period  shall mean a period commencing on the Pricing Date and ending on the Fixed Rate Maturity Date.

  4.03      Pricing Elections.    Upon irrevocable Notice to Lender in accordance with Paragraph 2.04 above, as to principal (i) in the amount of an advance, (ii)  in the Base Rate Loan Segment, or (iii)  in a Fixed Rate Loan Segment on a Fixed Rate Maturity Date, Borrower may elect to designate all or any part of the advance or of the Adjusted Principal Balance of such Loan Segment on such Pricing Date to bear interest at any Rate Option described herein; provided however, that (1) there is no Event of Default or Incipient Default, (2) no Fixed Rate Option may be selected which would have for its Fixed Rate Maturity Date a date later than the Loan Maturity Date, and (3) there are no more than three Fixed Rate Loan Segments at any one time.  If Borrower does not provide Lender irrevocable Notice of election of a Rate Option on a Fixed Rate Maturity Date for a Fixed Rate Loan Segment, the Adjusted Principal Balance of such Loan Segment will be priced at the Base Rate effective on such Pricing Date.   
    
  4.04      Single Base Rate Loan Segment  .    If on a Pricing Date, any Loan Segment is priced under the Base Rate resulting in more than one Loan Segment priced under the Base Rate, all Loan principal priced under the Base Rate will be treated as a single Base Rate Loan Segment by combining the Adjusted Principal Balances of such Loan Segments on such Pricing Date.

Interest rates using any other Index Source are calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during the year for the actual number of days in the year.   
    
  4.06      Index and Index Source  .    If the Index or Index Source provided for herein cannot be ascertained during the Note term, Lender will choose a new index or Index Source which it determines, in its sole discretion, is comparable to be effective upon notification thereof to Borrower. 
    
  4.07      Additional Pricing Options  .    In the event Borrower should desire to price a Loan Segment using the Index, Pricing Date and margin other than as provided for herein, Borrower may request Lender to quote a rate and lock-in fee for an identified principal amount and desired pricing option.   

Note and Loan Agreement (Seventh Avenue Poulsbo, LLC/Note No. 6097341) 
  14 

Lender will provide Borrower such a quote if available under Lender s then existing policies and procedures, and shall provide Borrower the option to elect such a rate upon payment of the lock-in fee, if required, which rate shall be effective on the Pricing Date for the Loan Segment, upon terms and conditions and within timeframes as Lender may prescribe at the time of the quote. 
    
  4.08      Changes in Circumstances  .    In the event that, on any date on which an interest rate for pricing this Note is to be determined, Lender determines that the applicable interest rate does not adequately reflect the cost to Lender of making or maintaining its loans, Lender shall promptly give notice of such facts to Borrower.  Within ten days thereof, Borrower shall make an appointment to meet with Lender to determine a new adjustment factor for pricing this Note.  Any change to the adjustment factor shall require mutual written consent and agreement. 
    
  5.    Payment.

Such payments shall be due and payable, commencing on the first day of the month beginning on February 1, 2013, and shall continue on the first day of each month thereafter until the Loan is paid in full.  Provided however, so long as there is no Event of Default or Incipient Default, upon a Pricing Date for a Loan Segment, Lender will reamortize the Adjusted Principal Balance of the Loan Segment on such Pricing Date over the period from such Pricing Date to January 1, 2033. 
    
  5.02      Payment in Full on Loan Maturity Date  .    The unpaid principal balance, unpaid interest thereon, and other amounts due under this Note and the other Loan Documents shall be paid in full on the Loan Maturity Date.  The payment required in Paragraph 5.01 results in a balloon payment being due on the Loan Maturity Date. 
    
  5.03      Manner of Payments  .    Upon Lender s written request, payments shall be electronically submitted no later than 10:00 a.m. Spokane time on the date specified for payment.  If any payment date is not a Business Day, then payment shall be due on the next succeeding Business Day.      All sums payable to Lender hereunder shall be paid directly to Lender in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars.  Lender shall send to Borrower periodic statements of all amounts due hereunder at applicable interest rates, which statements shall be considered correct and conclusively binding on Borrower in all respects and for all purposes unless Borrower notifies Lender in writing of any objections within 15 days of receipt of any such statement, provided, however, that failure to receive a periodic statement shall not excuse payment of any sums payable hereunder. 
    
  5.04      Application of Payments  .    Lender may apply any payment received from or on behalf of Borrower to principal, interest, or any part of the indebtedness, including any fees and expenses due under this Note or any other Loan Document, as Lender, in its sole discretion, may choose.  Subject to the preceding sentence, Borrower may at any time pay any amount of principal in advance of its maturity subject to the Prepayment Fee described herein.  Unless Lender otherwise elects, so long as there is no Event of Default, principal prepayments shall reduce the balance owing and discharge the indebtedness at an earlier date, but shall not alter the obligation to pay scheduled  

Note and Loan Agreement (Seventh Avenue Poulsbo, LLC/Note No. 6097341) 
  15 

payments until the indebtedness is paid in full.  In addition, so long as there is no Event of Default or Incipient Default, principal prepayments shall be applied to principal under a given Loan Segment, as selected by Borrower, in inverse order of their maturity, and shall not alter the obligation to pay scheduled payments until the indebtedness for each Loan Segment is paid in full. 
    
  5.05      Right of Setoff  .    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any and all of the obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Note or any other Loan Document to Lender, irrespective of whether or not Lender shall have made any demand under this Note or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness.  The rights of Lender under this Paragraph 5.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that Lender may have. 
    
  5.06      Disbursements  .    Borrower agrees that all Loan funds disbursed shall be used only for the Loan Purpose. 
    
  6.    Prepayment and Breakage Fees. 
    
  6.01      Prepayment Fee  .    The following Prepayment Fee shall apply to the Loan and supersede and replace any inconsistent terms in the Prior Note and this Note.  The Loan is subject to the following Prepayment Fee. 
    
  a.      Exemption to Prepayment Fee  .  Principal prepayments made while a Loan Segment is priced under the Base Rate shall not be subject to a Prepayment Fee.  In addition, there is no Prepayment Fee for any prepaid principal if a prepayment is received on a Fixed Rate Maturity Date for the Loan Segment being prepaid.  Other prepayments of principal shall be subject to a Prepayment Fee, as described below.   
    
  b.       Prepayment  Defined  .  For purposes of this Note,  prepayment  shall mean any instance wherein the indebtedness is partially or fully satisfied in any manner prior to a payment due date whether voluntarily or involuntarily (excluding scheduled payments that have been paid) pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents.  Prepayment shall include, but not be limited to:  (i) any payment after an Event of Default under the Loan Documents; (ii) payment to Lender by any holder of an interest in any Collateral; (iii) any payment after the Loan Maturity Date is accelerated for any reason; (iv) payment resulting from any sale or transfer of Collateral pursuant to foreclosure, sale under power, judicial order or trustee s sale; and (v) payment by sale, transfer or offsetting credit in connection with or under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or receivership or similar proceedings under any statute of the United States or any state thereof involving Borrower or the Collateral.  In the event of any acceleration of the Loan Maturity Date, the amount due hereunder shall include the charge which would be due under the Prepayment Fee in the event of a voluntary prepayment at the time of such  

Note and Loan Agreement (Seventh Avenue Poulsbo, LLC/Note No. 6097341) 
  16 

acceleration, and the date of acceleration of the Loan Maturity Date will be deemed to be the date of prepayment. 
    
  c.      Prepayment Fee  .  The  Prepayment Fee  is an amount intended to reasonably compensate Lender for the loss of the intended benefit of Lender s bargain in the case of a prepayment.  Borrower and Lender intend that the principal balance of each Loan Segment will yield to Lender an annual return after the date the Loan Segment is prepaid of not less than the annual return for the period when the interest rate is fixed.  In the event of a prepayment, Lender will lose the intended benefit of its bargain.  Accordingly, the Prepayment Fee is intended to reasonably compensate Lender for such loss and costs.  The Prepayment Fee shall be payable on demand, and shall be an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology. 
    
  6.02      Breakage Fee  .    In the event of an occurrence under subparagraphs a. or b. below, then Borrower shall immediately pay Lender, on demand, a Breakage Fee in an amount calculated on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology:

  b.    Borrower provides Lender Notice that Loan principal priced under a Fixed Rate Option is to be repriced or prepaid on other than a Pricing Date, after which Borrower revokes such Notice or fails to prepay pursuant to the Notice. 
    
  6.03      Participation  .    Participant(s), if any, may calculate a Prepayment Fee or Breakage Fee using the calculation on a make-whole basis, as calculated under Lender s then current methodology, provided however, a participant may use a different methodology than Lender. 
    
  7.    Default. 
    
  7.01      Events of Default  .    Time is of the essence in the performance of this Note.  The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an  Event of Default  under this Note: 
    
  a.    Borrower fails to make any payment of principal, interest or other costs, fees or expenses when due and payable or to perform any obligation or covenant as and when required under the Loan Documents for the Loan or any other note, loan or contract Borrower, or any of them, may have with Lender or an affiliate of Lender. 
    
  b.    Any financial statement, representation, warranty or certificate made or furnished by Borrower or Guarantor to Lender in connection with the Loan, or as an inducement to Lender to enter into the Loan is materially false, incorrect, or incomplete when made. 
    
  c.    Any Bankruptcy Event shall occur with respect to Borrower, or any Bankruptcy Event that has a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower shall occur with respect to any of Borrower s Subsidiaries.

  e.    This Note or any other Loan Document ceases to be valid and binding on Borrower or Guarantor or is declared null and void, or the validity or enforceability thereof is contested by Borrower or Guarantor or Borrower or Guarantor denies that it has any or further liability under this Note or any of the other Loan Documents. 
    
  7.02      Acceleration  .    In the event of any uncured Event of Default beyond any applicable cure periods provided for in the Loan Documents, at Lender's option, without notice or demand, the unpaid principal balance of the Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due shall immediately become due and payable. 
    
  7.03      Default Interest Rate  .    The Default Interest Rate applicable to a delinquent payment for a Loan Segment shall equal four percent (4%) per annum above the interest rate in effect on such Loan Segment at the time such payment was due, which rate shall accrue on the total amount of the payment due until paid, accelerated or upon maturity; provided however, that upon acceleration and/or maturity, the Default Interest Rate shall be equal to and remain at four percent (4%) per annum above the interest rate in effect for each Loan Segment at the time of acceleration or maturity and shall accrue on the entire unpaid balance of the Loan Segment until paid in full. 
    
  7.04      Notice and Opportunity to Cure  .

Note and Loan Agreement (Seventh Avenue Poulsbo, LLC/Note No. 6097341) 
  20

  c.    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Borrower shall not assert, and each such party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Note, any other Loan Document or any agreement
