Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation and Organization   

Yappn
Corp., formerly  Plesk Corp. , (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on November 3, 2010. The business plan of the Company is to provide effective unique and proprietary tools and services that create
dynamic solutions that enhance a brand s messaging, media, e-commerce and support platforms. The Company has offices in
the United States and Canada. In March 2013, the Company acquired a concept and technology license from Intertainment Media Inc.,
a Canadian company, in exchange for 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. As a result of this exchange, Intertainment
Media Inc. acquired, at that time, a seventy percent (70%) ownership of the Company. On September 15, 2015, the Company closed
the acquisition of Ortsbo Inc. s (subsidiary of Intertainment Media Inc.) intellectual property. As a result of the acquisition,
Intertainment Media Inc. s ownership was reduced to 37%. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company were prepared from the accounts of the Company under the accrual basis of accounting.  

Unaudited
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of August 31, 2016, and for the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, are
unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments,
consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of August
31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three month period ended August 31,
2016 and August 31, 2015. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the fiscal year ending May 31,
2017. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto do not reflect all disclosures required
under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Refer to the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements as of May 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for additional information including significant
accounting policies. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 which was amended in August 2015 by Update No 2015-14: Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard outlines a five-step model for revenue recognition with the core principle being that
a company should recognize revenue when it transfers control of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the
consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Companies can choose to apply the standard
using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. Under the modified approach, financial statements
will be prepared for the year of adoption using the new standard but prior periods presented will not be adjusted. Instead, companies
will recognize a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This new guidance is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company
has not yet made a determination as to the method of application (full retrospective or modified retrospective). It is too early
to assess whether the impact of the adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations
or financial position.  

On
August 27, 2014 the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial
Statements   Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as
a Going Concern.  The standard provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this update apply to all companies.
They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.  

In
November 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2014-16,  Determining Whether the Host Contract
in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity.  The ASU clarifies how
current guidance should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial
instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant
terms and features, including the embedded derivatives feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of a
host contract. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2016. The Company has determined there is no material impact to the accounting treatment of its hybrid financial instruments
based on this new standard.  

2.
Going Concern   

The
accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as
a going concern. The Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and has incurred a deficit of
$23,447,696 through August 31, 2016.  

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had a working
capital deficit of $1,407,491. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $471,341.
The Company expects to have similar cash needs for the next twelve months. At the present time, the Company does not have sufficient
funds to fund operations over the next twelve months. 

Implementation
of the Company business plan will require additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that additional financing
can be obtained on acceptable terms. The Company has realized limited revenues to cover its operating costs. As such, the Company
has incurred an operating loss since inception. This and other factors raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet their obligations,
to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitability. The interim consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management
plans to meet its operating cash flow requirements from financing activities until the future operating activities become sufficient
to support the business to enable the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to work on generating operating
cash flows from the commercialization of its business. Until those cash flows are sufficient the Company will pursue other financing
when deemed necessary.  

The Company is pursuing a number of different
financing opportunities in order to execute its business plan. These include, short term debt arrangements, convertible debt arrangements,
common share equity financings, either through a private placement or through the public markets. During the three months ended
August 31, 2016, the Company raised $70,848 through various financial instruments, net of repayments. Subsequent to the three
month ended August 31, 2016, the Company raised $500,000 in cash proceeds (Note 13). 

There
can be no assurance that the raising of future equity or debt will be successful or that the Company s anticipated financing
will be available in the future, at terms satisfactory to the Company. Failure to achieve the equity and financing at satisfactory
terms and amounts could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the
Company cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic development plan, its liquidity, financial condition
and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected, and the Company may have to cease operations.  

3.
Concentration of Credit Risk    

All of the Company s revenues are attributed
to a small number of customers. One former customer comprises 100% of the note receivable balance as at August 31, 2016 and 0%
of the revenue recorded for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 100% of the revenue for the three months ended August 31,
2015. Intelligent Content Enterprises ( ICE ) comprises 53% of revenue recorded for the three months ended August 31,
2016. The Company billed ICE $59,681 for the three month ended August 31, 2016, none of which has been recorded as part of the
accounts receivable or revenue. Due to the long period without payment, the Company has determined the revenue recognition criteria
starting at the beginning of the Company s second quarter of fiscal 2016 for Digital Widget Factory (Belize) ( DWF )
was not met and further revenues in fiscal 2017 will not be recorded until reasonable assurance over collectability has been established. 

Effective February 29, 2016, DWF sold the
technology platform, partially developed by Yappn, in conjunction with DWF s principals, to ICE in exchange for common shares
of ICE. As part of the transaction, DWF received ownership and rights to 24 million common shares of ICE for a large minority
shareholder position of ICE. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company executed a promissory note from DWF, for the
outstanding value of the billings of $2,125,000 (of which $968,289 is recorded as a note receivable at August 31, 2016 and was
previously recognized in revenue and a trade receivable). The promissory note is secured by DWF s ICE stock holdings in
the amount of 2,250,000 restricted common shares, which at the market value at the time of execution significantly exceeded the
value of the promissory note. The note receivable includes monthly payments of differing amounts with the final payment scheduled
by November 30, 2016. The note receivable is past due on contractual payments by $807,500 as at August 31, 2016. 

Additionally,
the Company received stock options for the purchase of shares of common stock of ICE from DWF. The first option entitles Yappn
to subscribe for purchase from DWF up to 1,000,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of ICE s common stock at a purchase
price of $0.55 per share exercisable until $987,500 remains outstanding on the note receivable, of which the price of the option
is offset against $550,000 of the remaining note receivable. DWF can elect to buy out the option at any time at a price of $0.75
per each underlying share of the option agreement. For each missed payment (not the remedy period per the promissory note, but
any payment not made on the exact due date), the buyout price will increase by $0.05 per underlying share for each payment date
missed starting with the payment due on June 30, 2016 per promissory note. The second option entitles Yappn to subscribe for purchase
from DWF up to 1,250,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of ICE s common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share
until $437,500 is remaining on the note receivable. DWF can elect to buy out the option at any time at a price of $0.50 per each
underlying share of the option agreement. For each missed payment (not the remedy period per the promissory note, but any payment
not made on the exact due date), the buyout price will increase by $0.05 per underlying share for each payment date missed starting
with the payment due on June 30, 2016 per promissory note. The value of these options is not recognized in the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements, as the maximum value recorded is limited to what has previously been recorded as revenue as
at August 31, 2016.  

4.
Acquisition of Intellectual Property    

On September 15, 2015, the Company finalized
its purchase of intellectual property assets of Ortsbo, Inc. ( Ortsbo ) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed
and closed on July 15, 2015. With this closing, the Company had an obligation to issue 31,987,000 shares of common stock of Yappn
to Ortsbo or its designees. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, from the share issuance obligations from the purchase of
the Ortsbo intellectual property assets, 12,998,682 shares were issued comprising 8,312,500 to Ortsbo and 4,686,182 to the former
debt and minority shareholders of Ortsbo, which were valued at $1,806,608 leaving 18,988,318 shares to be issued which remain
outstanding as at August 31, 2016. Yappn also assumed $975,388 of debt as part of the transaction. This assumed debt was immediately
subscribed as part of the secured debenture in Yappn (Note 6). The fair value for the agreed upon consideration for the acquisition
of intellectual property from Ortsbo was $16,968,888, however, due to the common control of Ortsbo Inc. and the Company, the value
of the intangible assets acquired from Ortsbo was recorded at the carrying value in the financial records of Ortsbo Inc. This
value was $5,421,067 on September 15, 2015. 

5.
Short Term Loans   

The
Company has a past due term loan originated on April 1, 2014 with an interest rate of 1% per month. The Company repaid $15,483
(Canadian $20,000) during the three months ended August 31, 2016. As at August 31, 2016, the loan had a value of $90,588 ($118,815
Canadian).  

The
Company has a past due term loan originated on January 7, 2014 with an interest rate of 1% per month. The Company repaid $13,899
(Canadian $18,125) during the three months ended August 31, 2016. As at August 31, 2016, the loan had a value of $64,711 ($75,000
Canadian).  

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company received $100,000 from a director as an intended subscription in anticipation of
a third closing of a private placement of units consisting of one common stock at $0.25 per share and one common stock purchase
warrant with an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The Company completed this closing on August 31, 2016 and the loan was applied
against the private placement (Note 9).  

The
following is a summary of Short Term Loans:  

6.
Line of Credit Arrangement and Secured Debentures   

On
April 7, 2014, the Company finalized its line of credit arrangement whereby the Company could borrow up to $3,000,000 from a third
party lender. The loan agreement was for an initial two year term subject to the lender s right to demand repayment of the
outstanding balance. It carried an interest rate of 12% per annum and a 1% draw down fee on each draw.  

During
fiscal 2016, the Company borrowed $150,000 against the line of credit and converted $2,000,000 to secured debentures. The facility
is no longer available to the Company and the outstanding obligation was $nil at August 31, 2016.  

Yappn closed the first tranche of secured debentures
in the amount of $4.5 million. The secured debentures carry an annual interest rate of 12% payable at maturity. Maturity was initially
the earlier of the date proceeds are available from a public offering or December 31, 2015. During the third quarter of fiscal
2016, the holders of the Secured Debentures (the  Holders ) agreed to extend the maturity date of the Secured Debentures
from December 31, 2015 to July 15, 2020, and were provided with the right to amend the Secured Debenture such that a Holder shall
have the right, at any time after the earlier of (i) six (6) months from the date of first issuance of any subsequent Debentures;
and (ii) June 30, 2016, to require the Company to satisfy the outstanding obligations underlying the Secured Debenture; provided,
however, that at least two thirds (66.67%) of the Holders of the principal amount of the Secured Debentures consent to a put of
their Secured Debentures to the Company. Yappn executed a non-binding letter of intent with Winterberry Investments Inc. ( Winterberry ),
a private company led by Mr. David Berry, a current director, pursuant to which Winterberry will facilitate and manage the financing
transaction as well as to advise on Yappn's future capital programs. The Company received $2.5 million of this financing in the
form of cash and cash commitments, including conversion of the short term loans obtained on May 11, 2015 and June 19, 2015. $2,000,000
of the $4.5 million financing is conversion of a portion of the Company s existing debt that remained in the secured debenture.
$925,000 was repaid out of the secured debenture, in the form of cash in the amount of $465,000 with the remainder in the form

Convertible Promissory Notes and Debentures   

The
following is a summary of the convertible promissory notes and debentures as of August 31, 2016:  

Convertible
Debentures with Series A and B Warrants     

On
January 29, 2014, February 27, 2014, and April 1, 2014, the Company issued 395, 305, and 469 Units for $395,000, $305,000, and
$469,000 respectively, to accredited investors under subscription agreements. The Units, as defined in the subscription agreements,
consist of (i) one unsecured 6% convertible promissory note, $100 par value, convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock; (ii) a warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock (individually Series A Warrant) at
an exercise price of $1.50; and, (iii) a warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock (individually
Series B Warrant) at an exercise price of $2.00 (Note 10). The purchase price for each Unit was $1,000 and resulted in a funding
total of $1,069,000 in cash and the retirement of $100,000 debt obligation to a private investor.  

The notes mature 24 months from the issuance
date and has an interest rate of 6% per annum payable in arrears on the earlier of a default date or the maturity date. The notes
may be converted at any time after the original issuance date at the election of their holders to convert all or part of the outstanding
and unpaid principal amount and accrued interest at a conversion price of $1.00 per share repriced from $1.50 due to a breach
to previously contracted price protection clauses which have expired. Any amount of principal or interest which is not paid when
due, shall bear interest at the rate of 16% per annum from the date it is due. The Series B warrants do not provide any price
protection provisions and therefore are treated as equity instruments at the commitment date and thereafter. Both the Series A
and Series B warrants have a five year life. 

The convertible debentures due on January 29,
February 27, 2016, and April 1, 2016 respectively were not repaid or converted into common shares of the Company by the maturity
dates. Non-repayment of the debentures triggered a penalty interest rate whereby the stated interest rate goes up to 16% from the
original 6%. The Company management is diligently working with the debenture holders on either extension terms or conversion into
common shares as the Company does not currently have the ability to repay these debtholders in cash. In fiscal 2016, $260,000 in
principal value of debenture holders took the offer for additional investment and repricing of both warrants (Note 9). During the
three month period ended August 31, 2016, $175,000 in principal value of debenture holders took conversion but only the Series
A warrants were repriced (Notes 9 and 10). The holders of $175,000 in principal converted have the right to an additional issuance
of shares if Company closes a financing below $0.25 per common share for a six month period to a floor of $0.20 per common share.
Interest expense for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was $43,760 ($17,679 for the three months ended August 31, 2015).
Interest expense is recorded in accrued expenses on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Convertible
Debentures with Series C or Series D Warrants    

During
late fiscal 2014, and early fiscal 2015 the Company authorized and issued 1,050 Units for $1,050,000 to private investors, and
475 Units for $475,000 to seven independent accredited investors respectively. The 475 Units were issued in exchange for $300,000
in cash and release of $90,777 (Canadian $100,000) in the loan originated on January 7, 2014 and $50,000 in settlement of trade
payables. The Units, as defined in the subscription agreement, consist of (i) one unsecured 6% convertible debenture, $100 par
value convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $1.50 per share; and (ii) a warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase 700,000 shares of common stock (Series C Warrant) and 316,666 shares of common stock
(Series D Warrant) at a purchase price of $2.20 per share that expires in 5 years (Note 10).  

The
debentures mature 24 months from the issuance date and have an interest rate of 6% per annum payable in arrears on the earlier
of a default date or the maturity date. The notes may be converted at any time after the original issuance date at the election
of their holders to convert all or part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued interest at a conversion price
of $1.50 per share. The warrants may be exercised in whole or in part.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and
first quarter of fiscal 2017 $1,125,000 in principal value of debenture holders converted their outstanding debentures and accrued
interest into common stock of the company as well as received amendments to their warrants price of $0.25 (Notes 9 and 10). The
holders of $1,125,000 in principal converted have the right to an additional issuance of shares if Company closes a financing below
$0.25 per common share for a six month period to a floor of $0.20 per common share. All remaining term and conditions still same
as before. Interest expense for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was $28,878 ($23,063 for the three months ended August
31, 2015). Interest expense is recorded in accrued expenses on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Convertible Secured Debentures   

On
December 30, 2015, the Company completed a secured debenture and warrant financing of $2,040,000 ($1,075,000 from directors of
the Company) through the offering of units by way of private placement, with each unit consisting of (i) a 12% secured convertible
debenture with a maturity date of five years from issuance convertible at $0.25 per common stock and (ii) ten (10) five year common
share purchase warrants, vesting in 1/3 increments with 1/3 vested in one year, 1/3 to be vested in two years and 1/3 to be vested
in three years and having an exercise price of $0.01 per share (Note 10). The units were sold at $1.00 per unit.  

Values
were allocated for this private placement between the debt, equity warrants, and the beneficial conversion feature. The valuation
approach involved determining a fair value for the debt and warrants and then using the relative fair value method to allocate
value to these components. Based on relative fair values, the present value method was used to determine the fair values of the
debt and the binomial tree option pricing model was used to determine the fair value of the warrants. The value of the interest
and principal payments of the debentures resulted in a value of $459,020 for the debentures and the binomial model resulted in
a value for warrants for $1,580,980. The assumptions used for the binomial model are: Volatility 177%, expected life of five years,
risk free interest rate of 1.80%, and dividend rate of 0%. Additionally, this convertible secured debenture instrument includes
a beneficial conversion feature as the effective conversion price is less than the Company s market price of common stock
on the commitment date. The value of this beneficial conversion feature is $459,020. The resulting fair value of the debt is $nil,
with $1,580,980 allocated to equity warrants (Note 10) and $459,020 to the beneficial conversion feature, both which are recorded
as components of additional paid in capital.  

On
May 1, 2016, the Company closed a secured debenture and warrant financing through conversion of a short term loan of $170,468
from a director of the Company that was otherwise payable on demand in cash. The offering of units was by way of private placement,
with each unit consisting of (i) a 12% secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of five years from issuance convertible
at $0.25 per common stock and (ii) ten (10) five year common share purchase warrants, vesting in 1/3 increments with 1/3 vested
immediately, 1/3 to be vested in one year and 1/3 to be vested in two years and having an exercise price of $0.01 per share (Note
10). The units were sold at $1.00 per unit.  

Values
were allocated for this private placement between debt, equity warrants, and the beneficial conversion feature similar to the
secured debenture and warrant financing of $2,040,000 closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (see above). The value of the
interest and principal payments of the debentures resulted in a value of $51,396 for the debentures and the binomial model resulted
in a value for warrants for $119,072. The assumptions used for the binomial model are: Volatility 180%, expected life of five
years, risk free interest rate of 1.28%, and dividend rate of 0%. Additionally, this convertible secured debenture instrument
includes a beneficial conversion feature as the effective conversion price is less than the Company s market price of common
stock on the commitment date. The value of this beneficial conversion feature is $51,396. The resulting fair value of the debt
is $nil, with $119,072 allocated to equity warrants (Note 10) and $51,396 to the beneficial conversion feature, both which are
recorded as components of additional paid in capital.  

The
difference between the fair value and face value of the debentures is to be accreted up to face value over the term to maturity
using the effective interest method. The carrying value of the debenture liability as at August 31, 2016 is $273,714 for the December
30, 2015 closing and $11,390 for the May 1, 2016 closing.  

The
following table summarizes the fair values of the components of the convertible secured debentures, including the debt, warrants,
and the beneficial conversion feature.  

On
May 1, 2016, the Company completed a secured debenture financing with a consultant in settlement of $200,000 in obligations with
similar terms as the above private placement with no warrant financing, through the offering of units by way of private placement,
with each unit consisting of (i) a 12% secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of five years from issuance convertible
at $0.25 per common. The $200,000 debenture was accounted for as a single debt instrument.  

Interest expense for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was $72,314 ($nil for the three months ended
August 31, 2016). Interest expense is recorded in accrued expenses on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Employee Benefit and Incentive Plans   

On August 14, 2014, the Board of Directors
approved the adoption of the 2014 Stock Option Plan, which was ratified by the shareholders on December 22, 2014. On August 21,
2015, the Company amended its 2014 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of options available to 25,000,000. 

The
following table outlines the options granted and related disclosures:  

As
at August 31, 2016, vested and exercisable options do not have any intrinsic value and have a weighted-average remaining contractual
term of 4.0 years. It is expected the 9,135,833 unvested options will ultimately vest. These options have a weighted average exercise
price of $0.26 per share and a weighted average remaining term of 4.58 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of options represents
the total pre-tax intrinsic value, the difference between our closing stock price as at August 31, 2016 and the option s
exercise price, for all options that are in the money. This value was $nil as at August 31, 2016.  

As
at August 31, 2016, there is $1,800,919 of unearned stock based compensation cost related to stock options granted that have not
yet vested (9,135,833 options). This cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.6 years.  

710,000
and 520,000 of the stock options granted on August 14, 2014 and March 2, 2015 respectively vest 1/3 immediately, 1/3 after one
year and 1/3 after two years. The remaining options have immediate vesting terms or have been cancelled or expired. 8,750,000
and 3,200,000 of the stock options granted on March 21, 2016 and August 25, 2016 respectively vest 1/4 immediately, 1/4 after
one year, 1/4 after two years, and 1/4 after three years. The remaining 25,000 options issued on March 21, 2106 have immediate
vesting terms.  

The
estimated fair value of options granted is measured using the binomial model using the following assumptions:  

The
assumptions used in the stock based compensation binomial models are consistent with the methodology used in valuing the Company s
other derivatives debt and warrant financings. Due to a lack of history, the Company has assumed the expected life of the options
is the contractual life of the options.

Company issued 250,000 warrants on August 25, 2016 to a recently appointed Advisory Board member at an exercise price of $0.25
with expiry date of August 25, 2021. These were expensed as stock based compensation.  

On
May 1, 2016, the Company completed secured debenture financing with a consultant, whose principal is the former CEO of
the Company, for $200,000 with no warrant financing, through the offering of units by way of private placement, with each
unit consisting of (i) a 12% secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of five years from issuance convertible at
$0.25 per common. This closing includes conversion of $200,000 in consulting expense. The Company also issued 4,000,000
warrants at an exercise price of $0.25 included in consulting expense with an expiry of May 1, 2021. Consultant was also
granted a $100,000 signing bonus payable in cash. All obligations due to the former CEO of Yappn including $294,906 in cash
obligations as an employee and $18,200 as a consultant prior to May 1, 2016, have been forgiven. All obligations being
forgiven were recorded as general and administrative expenses within fiscal 2016 and were reversed out from general
and administrative expenses.  

1,200,000
of the shares from the 2 nd  tranche of common stock private placement at $0.25 per unit totaling $300,000 in cash proceeds
were issued to two members of the board of directors (Note 9).  

1,000,000
of the shares from the 3 rd  tranche of common stock private placement at $0.25 per unit totaling $250,000 in cash proceeds
and compensation for consulting work were issued to four members of the board of directors (Note 9).  

On March 21, 2016, the Board of Directors
passed a resolution for a contingent common stock award in line with the metrics used in the CEO s targets for
additional bonus compensation. The award would see the members of the Board of Directors as well as the Advisory
Board receive common shares for the Company reaching revenue milestones. Per the resolution, 500,000 common shares for each
member of the Board of Directors and 250,000 for each Advisory Board member would be issued when the following milestones are
met: (i) $3.5 million in new revenue generated and realized within 12 months of the start date of the CEO which was
February 22, 2016 and minimum of 5 new recurring revenue contracts being signed within 12 months of the start date; or (ii)
$5 million of new revenue generated and realized within 24 months of the start date and minimum of 5 new recurring revenue
contracts being signed within 12 months of the start date. 

On August 25, 2016 a recently appointed Advisory
Board member received the same contingent common stock award of 250,000 common shares as described above for the March 21, 2016
award to Advisory Board members.

value of debenture holders converted their outstanding debentures and accrued interest into common stock of the company as well
as received amendments to their Series A, C or D warrants as applicable to a price of $0.25. The holders of $224,000 in principal
converted have the right to an additional issuance of shares if Company closes a financing below $0.25 per common share for a six
month period to a floor of $0.20 per common share (Note 10). All remaining terms and conditions remain the same. 

On

$0.35.  

On
September 23, 2016, the Company issued 780,000 shares of common stock for $195,000 cash received against the fourth tranche and
final closing of a private placement of units consisting of one common stock at $0.25 per share and one common stock purchase
warrant with an exercise price of $0.25 per share. These warrants will vest in increments of thirds with the first 1/3 being vested
on September 23, 2017, second increment of 1/3 on September 23, 2018, and last 1/3 on September 23, 2019.  

On
September 30, 2016, the Company issued 120,000 shares of common stock as settlement against prior accounts payables.  

On October 3, 2016, the Company filed a request
to withdraw is previously filed Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-207292), with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). On October 3, 2016 the Company filed a new Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-213947) (the
 Registration Statement ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to 14,840,964 shares of Yappn Corp. s
$0.0001 par value per share common stock (the  Common Stock ) issuable to certain selling stockholders that are issued
and outstanding and upon conversion of promissory notes, related past due accrued interest and penalties and/or warrants currently
held by those selling stockholders, specifically (i) 8,227,821 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding (ii) 907,200 shares
of Common Stock issuable to them upon exercise of promissory notes (iii) 273,272 shares of Common Stock issuable underlying past
due accrued interest and penalties and (iv) 5,432,671 shares of Common Stock issuable to them upon exercise of warrants. The warrants
have an exercise price varying from $0.25 to $2.20 per share (subject to adjustment). The Registration Statement has not yet been
declared effective. 

On various dates in October 2016, a director advanced the Company $500,000 to be subscribed as a part of a
future secured debt financing in which the Company is currently finalizing the definitive agreements which will be followed by
a formal approval by its Board of Directors of the definitive agreements and the total dollar amount approved.

within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section
21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Any statements about our expectations,
beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These

We base these forward-looking statements on our expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our business and the
industry in which we operate as of the date of this Quarterly Report. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted, quantified or controlled and that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements. Statements in this Quarterly Report
describe factors, among others, that could contribute to or cause these differences. Actual results may vary materially from those
anticipated, estimated, projected or expected should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect. Because the factors discussed in this Quarterly Report could cause actual results or outcomes to
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statement. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict
which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Except
as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available
after the date of this Quarterly Report or the date of documents incorporated by reference herein that include forward-looking
statements.

Discussion and Analysis of Results of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) should be read in
conjunction with our financial statements included herein. Further, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with our Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
May 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 18, 2016. Our actual results could differ materially

Business
History   

We
were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 3, 2010 with an initial business plan to import
consumer electronics, home appliances and plastic housewares. In March 2013, we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to change our name to  YAPPN Corp.  and increase our authorized capital stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Further, in March 2013, our
Board of Directors declared a stock dividend, whereby an additional 14 shares of our common stock was issued for each one share
of common stock outstanding to each holder of record on March 25, 2013. All per share information in this report reflect the effect
of such stock dividend. On December 22, 2014, our shareholders approved the increase of authorized and issued shares of common
stock to 400,000,000 shares of common stock.  

On
March 28, 2013, we purchased a prospective social media platform and related group of assets known as Yappn ( Yappn )
from Intertainment Media, Inc. ( IMI ), a corporation organized under the laws of Canada, for 7,000,000 shares of
our common stock, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement  and the transaction, the  Asset
Purchase ) by and among IMI, us, and our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Yappn Acquisition Sub., Inc., a Delaware
corporation ( Yappn Sub ). Mr. David Lucatch, our prior Chief Executive Officer was the Chief Executive Officer of
IMI at that time. IMI, as a result of this transaction had a controlling interest in our company. Included in the purchased assets
is a services agreement (the  Services Agreement ) dated March 21, 2013 by and among IMI and its wholly owned subsidiaries
Ortsbo, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Canada ( Ortsbo Canada ), and Ortsbo USA, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ( Ortsbo USA  and, collectively with Ortsbo Canada,  Ortsbo ). Ortsbo is the owner of certain
multi-language real time translation intellectual property that we believe is a significant component of the Yappn business opportunity.
On July 6, 2015, Yappn entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the intellectual property assets of Ortsbo (see below).  

On
July 15, 2015, after the approval of the Board of Directors of each company, Intertainment Media and Yappn entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire all of the intellectual property assets of Ortsbo.  

The
purchased assets include US Patent No. 8,983,850 B2, US Patent No. 8,917,631 B2, US Patent No. 9,053,097 B2, and other intellectual
property including Ecommerce and Customer Care know-how for a total purchase price of approximately $17 Million, which will be
paid by the assumption of approximately $1 Million in debt and the issuance of $16 Million worth of our restricted common shares
(32 Million shares at $0.50 per share).  

Intertainment
Media received Toronto Stock Venture Exchange final approval on September 14, 2015 to proceed with the transaction. On September
15, 2015, the acquisition of Ortsbo Intellectual property by our company was closed.  

Our
principal executive offices are located at 1001 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10018 and our telephone number
is (888) 859-4441. Our website is http://www.yappn.com (Our website is expressly not incorporated into this filing).  

Our
Business   

Yappn
delivers real-time language translation products which enable vendors and consumers to communicate freely with one another, each
in their own preferred languages. The result is increased business and customer satisfaction.  

Being
able to conduct business in multiple languages is essential. As per Common Sense Advisory (a research company specializing in
the areas of translation, localization, interpreting, internationalization, globalization, marketing, international strategy,
market intelligence, web content, and procurement), Global eCommerce sales continue to increase at a rate of 15 percent per year
and more than 72 percent of consumers say they are more likely to purchase online if the experience is in their preferred language.  

Breaking
down language barriers creates business opportunities and promotes efficiency and effectiveness within organizations. While internet
challenges have largely been solved, resolving language barriers remains a costly issue for every company wishing to access global
markets.  

Through
its proprietary innovative language solutions, we believe Yappn has altered the translation paradigm by offering a completely
customizable set of tools to engage consumers in up to 67 languages. Yappn s technology gives people, brands and organizations
the power to be social, conduct commerce and communicate freely without a language barrier.  

Generic
machine translation, which can be found from providers like Google Translate TM  or Microsoft Bing TM ,
employ a  word-for-word  approach. Unfortunately, the translated result does not always reflect the essence of
the original text and may not make sense. Context (cultural, political and ethnic), syntax and meaning are  simply not
captured through generic machine translation methods.  

Yappn
provides far more than simple word-for-word translation. Yappn translates the words as well as the context and syntax, thereby
ensuring that what is written in one language is translated into another in an accurate, meaningful and relevant way. This capability
is Yappn s key differentiator.  

Yappn
has the ability to detect the online or mobile user s preferred language and translates the communication into the user s
language in real-time. Yappn provides very  high fidelity  and accurate translation, without the necessity of direct
human translation or intervention, with an added option to customize translation settings, making the results simple, elegant
and cost effective.  

Yappn
offers products for eCommerce, customer care, enhanced messaging collaboration (such as intranets, gaming or social platforms),
online marketing and custom translation solutions to a variety of verticals including entertainment, retail and marketing.  

Continued
expansion of our business rollout will likely require additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that additional
financing can be obtained on acceptable terms. We are in the early stage of commercialization, and management believes that we
have insufficient revenues to cover our operating costs. As such, we have incurred an operating loss since inception. This and
other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is
dependent on our ability to meet our obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain
profitability. Our independent auditors have included an explanatory paragraph, in their audit report on our financial statements
for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Footnote 2 to the
Notes to this Form 10-Q Report also discusses concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Our
Strategy   

Our
management believes that Yappn approaches the challenge of real-time language translation in an entirely unique way. The result
is enhanced translations based on the context of the content or discussion, thereby significantly improving the translation result.  

To
accomplish this, Yappn leverages the power of multiple generic machine translation (MT) providers, recognizing that many of these
commodity services specialize and produce substantially better results in some languages over others. This aggregated generic
machine translation is then passed through Yappn s proprietary algorithms and enhancement processes which, in turn, provide
the optimal translation for the language requested. Yappn then applies yet another overlay of refinement through  lexicons .
Lexicons are essentially custom dictionaries designed to improve the translation by contextualizing the result and making it relevant
to the specific commercial requirement. Lexicons can be industry or brand specific or both.  

An
illustrative example of how Yappn s lexicons work is reflected in its ability to distinguish between a car transmission
versus a radio transmission. Similarly, the system understands that the word  travel  means something different in
basketball than it does when planning a trip. Companies use various words in unique ways and Yappn s lexicons continuously
evolve, improve and store these subtle nuances and then apply them to the final output to provide an enhanced and more optimal
translation.  

Yappn
is not a generic machine translation provider but an enhancement to create better, customized results. Additionally, Yappn is
not a Language Service Provider (LSP) simply returning a document in another language; instead Yappn provides tools and solutions
to better utilize translation in the course of business.  

Yappn s
tools and solutions are built with industry leading technology and hosted on the Microsoft Azure  cloud-based platform which
provides Yappn with global reach, dependable presence, and dynamic scalability.  

To
be certain that translation is highly accurate, Yappn s services team initially works with the customer to develop an appropriate
database of lexicon additions which can be further improved after deployment using Yappn s professional services or custom
tools. The lexicon can be enhanced on an on-going basis by the customer s staff as-needed when additions and revisions are
required.  

Yappn
can enable an auto update feature that can be used on demand or as a persistent connection that senses updates to the translation
source then has each addition either automatically changed or optionally human verified for fidelity, followed by an update to
the customer s lexicon. For example, when a product description is updated; the machine translation will instantly display
the change in the store.  

The
Yappn application suite is designed to provide a competitive advantage to commercial enterprises and power social users to communicate
more effectively without a language barrier, fostering and driving a competitive edge in a global marketplace.  

Offering
an  a la carte  menu of tools to engage consumers, Yappn helps clients improve their customer s experiences
and therefore increase customer satisfaction.

eCommerce
Platform Integration   

Yappn s
technology is, we contend, a game changing solution, providing a set of stand-alone commercial tools for brands to easily implement
cost effective globalization solutions that support the entire sales cycle, inclusive of the eCommerce website, shopping cart
checkout, marketing, sales and support. No longer is a company constrained to whom they can sell to because of language.  

The
Yappn eCommerce experience is more than a simple translation of a store. eCommerce applications exist today to translate a copy
of a store to another language. However, creating a separate instance of a store in another language is problematic as it can
cause several business issues that are difficult to rectify, for example, inventory reconciliation and amalgamated sales reporting
would be left to the vendor to handle manually. The Yappn solution of enabling a single store that is presented in the customer s
language of choice is a better business solution as we believe it will negate these issues.  

Yappn
has made the integration of these services into a store quite simple. Yappn uses standardized web technologies to connect a secondary
database of the translations of the text, metadata and keywords on the site. The benefit of the database connection is the ability
to call accompanying data such as imagery, (e.g. replacing an English ad with a Spanish ad) and the ability to manage translation
without coding expertise. This integration also allows Yappn to access the text components of a secure third party checkout screen,
thereby reducing cart abandonment, which, we contend, is unique to Yappn s services.  

Security
and privacy is maintained via a variety of solutions such as SSL encryption and the exception of customer/user identification
and private information from machine translation services.  

Customer
Care Platform Integration    

Yappn
Customer Care allows customers to chat in their language of choice, while our clients can staff their customer care operations
in their language of choice.  

Chat
is quickly becoming the preferred means for companies to communicate with their customers. Chat is replacing voice and e-mail
providing a window of opportunity for companies to better serve their customers and to do so more cost effectively.  

Using
Yappn s multilingual translation API in conjunction with the client s existing chat portal, a Customer Service Representative
(CSR) can converse with customers in the customer s language of choice with Yappn s technology bridging the language
gap between the two individuals.  

This
allows the CSR to think and type in their native language thereby providing better and more accurate service while reducing customer
care costs. Employing multilingual CSR staff is expensive and unnecessary with the use of Yappn s customer care solution.  

Enhanced
Messaging Platform Integration   

Yappn s
proprietary and easily integrated Enhanced Messaging Solution allows for real time communication between languages in a myriad
of platforms for social, business and gaming messaging. The translation is contextualized to provide superior translation results.  

Much
of the communication that transpires on messaging platforms is conducted in a single language. This is not always by choice but
instead, is driven by the limitations of the platforms themselves.  

Companies
that communicate internally but have staff, partners and customers with different languages can communicate more effectively when
the barrier of language is removed.  

Yappn s
technology can securely integrate into existing chat platforms through a simple API connection to Yappn s Microsoft Azure 
cloud platform, reducing existing workflow disruptions which would require changes to a client work environment.  

Marketing
Platform Integration    

Yappn
has created several tools to support online marketing customized for a global audience.  

Social
Wall: a fully branded and customized page, which includes the aggregation of a company s major social media accounts and
#hashtags automatically displayed in any of the 67 languages. This allows followers to interact with all their social media accounts,
in their language and on the company s website, giving the company back control of its marketing initiatives. Essentially,
a company can present a variety of social media sources on a single page in the language of a customer s choice, regardless
of the original language the social media content was written in.  

Multilingual
Chat: provides companies, brands, organizations and consumers with the ability to have topical discussions in almost any language.
Each user sees the chat experience in their preferred language and communicates to others in that language, allowing every user
to have a native experience in their individual language. The chat can be embedded to facilitate commenting on blogs, special
event discussions with brand ambassadors or as a standalone program, providing a place to discuss the company s brand.  

Live
and Global Events: a tool to promote a company s brand which embeds our interface directly onto the company s website
where the company can direct their consumers to attend a live Q A while promoting the company s brand on social media.
The technology allows the company to filter and reply to questions posted on Twitter  and display them in an easy to read
format on the company website, creating a captive audience to market to. Yappn s easy-to-use backend even allows the company
to reply to the attendees in their native language while automatically displaying the entire event in a user s individual
language automatically.  

Video
Captioning: If video promotion is an element of a company s marketing strategy, allowing a global audience to watch and
understand these videos is a natural complement. Yappn s translation system provides simple and accurate video sub-titling
in up to 67 languages, on a live or pre-recorded video, without disruption to the company s current broadcast process.  

Custom
Translation Solutions    

Yappn
is a consistent agile developer of tools and solutions to address the three important elements of conducting business: online
marketing, sales and customer care. We are, however, keenly aware that technologies and trends are evolving almost as fast as
we are. For this reason, Yappn publishes its technology via a secured API to enable today s entrepreneurs to enhance their
innovations with language capabilities. This secure credential-enabled connection is available in a SaaS or by way of pay per
use models and can be tested in sandbox environments. Each installation comes with full support from our development teams.  

Digital
Widget Factory   

In
November 2014, Yappn executed a three-year Master Services Agreement (MSA) and Statement of Work (SOW) with Digital Widget Factory
(Belize) ( DWF ) to develop and manage a minimum of 200 multilingual Ecommerce sites which will include multilingual
online marketing through traditional online services and social engagement. Contract terms allowed for pre-paid fees in association
with the project of a minimum of $700,000 plus ongoing professional fees in addition to 40% net profit on the program for the
term duration.  

The
Global Content Market is an ever growing market, with Ipsos Market Research stating that 7 out of 10 online consumers in 24 countries
have indicated that in a month they share some type of content on social media sites, including pictures as well as articles and
something recommended, such as a product, service, movie or book. Emarketer.com also points out that global ad spending was estimated
at nearly $600 billion worldwide in 2015 with the increase in digital and mobile platforms being the key growth in ad spending.  

Yappn,
through the program execution intended to provide multilingual online marketing through traditional online services and social
engagement with its proprietary patented technology to DWF. Yappn would do so by scheduling and supporting DWF s revenue
programs related to direct and network online advertising, schedule and support DWF s affiliate and Ecommerce partnerships
and also support DWF users to customize their content experience, submit original content and provides tools to incent sharing
of content and encourage users to build the membership base. Although Yappn ultimately is not proceeding with the DWF program
as originally contemplated, Yappn has provided content support as part of its service to Intelligent Content Enterprises, who
acquired the DWF technology, and Yappn is likely to continue to be the vendor of choice pertaining to language translation on
a go-forward basis, which more in line with Yappn s current business model.   

Effective February 29,
2016, DWF sold the technology platform, partially developed by Yappn, in conjunction with DWF s principals, to Intelligent
Content Enterprises Inc. ( ICE ) in exchange for common shares of ICE. As part of the transaction, DWF received ownership
and rights to 24 million common shares of ICE for a large minority shareholder position of ICE. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2016, the Company executed a promissory note from DWF, for the outstanding value of the billings of $2,125,000 (of which $968,289
is recorded as a note receivable at August 31, 2016 and was previously recognized in revenue and a trade receivable). The promissory
note is secured by DWF s ICE stock holdings in the amount of 2,250,000 restricted common shares, which at the market value
at the time of execution significantly exceeded the value of the promissory note. The note receivable includes monthly payments
of differing amounts with the final payment scheduled by November 30, 2016. The note receivable is past due on contractual payments
by $807,500 as at August 31, 2016. 

Additionally,
the Company received stock options for the purchase of shares of common stock of ICE from DWF. The first option entitles Yappn
to subscribe for purchase from DWF up to 1,000,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of ICE s common stock at a purchase
price of $0.55 per share exercisable until $987,500 remains outstanding on the note receivable, of which the price of the option
is offset against $550,000 of the remaining note receivable. DWF can elect to buy out the option at any time at a price of $0.75
per each underlying share of the option agreement. For each missed payment (not the remedy period per the promissory note, but
any payment not made on the exact due date), the buyout price will increase by $0.05 per underlying share for each payment date
missed starting with the payment due on June 30, 2016 per promissory note. The second option entitles Yappn to subscribe for purchase
from DWF up to 1,250,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of ICE s common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share
until $437,500 is remaining on the note receivable. DWF can elect to buy out the option at any time at a price of $0.50 per each
underlying share of the option agreement. For each missed payment (not the remedy period per the promissory note, but any payment
not made on the exact due date), the buyout price will increase by $0.05 per underlying share for each payment date missed starting
with the payment due on June 30, 2016 per promissory note. The value of these options is not recognized in the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements, as the maximum value recorded is limited to what has previously been recorded as revenue as
at August 31, 2016.  

The
Services Agreement    

We
acquired the rights to use the technology and management and development support services under the Services Agreement, dated
March 21, 2013 and amended October 2013, between Intertainment Media, Inc. ( IMI ), and IMI s wholly owned Ortsbo
subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, Ortsbo made available to us its representational state transfer
application programming interface (the  Ortsbo API ), which provides multi-language real-time translation as a cloud
service. The Services Agreement also provides that Ortsbo makes its  Live and Global  product offering, which enables
a cross language experience for a live, video streaming production, available to us as a service for marketing and promoting the
Yappn product in the marketplace (the  Services ). The Services do not include the  chat  technology itself
and we shall be solely responsible for creating, securing or otherwise building out our website and any mobile applications to
include chat functionality, user forums, user feedback, and related functionality within which the Ortsbo API can be utilized
to enable multi-language use. Under the initial agreement, no intellectual property owned by Ortsbo would be transferred to us
except to the extent set forth in the Services Agreement as described in  Intellectual Property  set forth below.  

In
October 2013, we amended the Services Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment to the Services Agreement, we have the first
right of refusal to purchase the Ortsbo platform and all its assets and operations for a period of two years; increasing the use
of Ortsbo's technology for business to consumer social programs at a purchase price to be negotiated at the time we exercise our
right. We would also have a right to purchase a copy of the source code only applicable to Yappn programs for $2,000,000 which
may be paid in cash or restricted shares of our common stock at a per share price of $1.50 per share. As part of the agreement,
we issued Ortsbo 166,667 shares of our restricted common stock. On April 28, 2014, we exercised our right to purchase a copy of
the source code for the Ortsbo property in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of restricted common stock for a value of $2,000,000.  

On
July 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the intellectual property assets of Ortsbo which closed
on September 15, 2015. The purchased assets include US Patent No. 8,983,850 B2, US Patent No. 8,917,631 B2, US Patent No. 9,053,097
B2, and other intellectual property including Ecommerce and Customer Care know-how for a total purchase price of approximately
$17 Million, which was paid by the assumption of approximately $1 Million in debt and the issuance of $16 Million worth of our
restricted common shares (32 Million shares at $0.50 per share). Upon the completion of the transaction on September 15, 2015
the amended Services Agreement was terminated.   

Competition

Our
business relating to and arising from the development of our assets is characterized by innovation, rapid change, patented, proprietary,
and disruptive technologies. We may face significant competition, including from companies that provide translation, tools to
facilitate the sharing of information, that enable marketers to display advertising and that provide users with multilingual real-time
translation of Ecommerce, events and proprietary social media and chat platforms. These may include:  

Companies
    that offer full-featured products that provide a similar range of communications and related capabilities that we provide.     

Companies
    that provide web and mobile-based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users.   

Companies
    that offer Ecommerce solutions with built in language support.   

Traditional
    and online businesses that offer corporate sponsorship opportunities and provide media for marketers to reach their audiences
    and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns.   

Competitors,
in some cases, may have access to significantly more resources than Yappn.  

We
anticipate that we will compete to attract, engage, and retain clients and users, to attract and retain marketers, to attract
and retain corporate sponsorship opportunities, and to attract and retain highly talented individuals, especially software engineers,
designers, and product managers. As we introduce new features to the Yappn platform, as the platform evolves, or as other companies
introduce new platforms and new features to their existing platforms, we may become subject to additional competition. We believe
that our ability to quickly adapt to a changing marketplace, and our experienced management team, will enable us to compete effectively
in the market.   

Intellectual
Property    

We
own (i) the yappn.com domain name (which website is expressly not incorporated into this filing) and (ii) the Yappn name and all
trademarks, service marks, trade dress and copyrights associated with the Yappn name, logo and graphic art. We may prepare several
patent filings in the future. Upon payment of the applicable fees pursuant to the Services Agreement, we became the exclusive
owner of copyright in the literary works or other works of authorship delivered by Ortsbo to us as part of the Services provided
under the Services Agreement (the  Deliverables ). All such rights shall not be subject to rescission upon termination
of the Services Agreement. Also as set forth in the Services Agreement, we shall grant to Ortsbo (i) a non-exclusive (subject
to certain limitations) license to use the Deliverables for the sole purpose of developing its technology, (ii) a non-exclusive
license to use, solely in connection with the provision of the Services, any intellectual property owned or developed by us or
on our behalf and necessary to enable Ortsbo to provide the Services and (iii) a license to use intellectual property obtained
by us from third parties and necessary to enable Ortsbo to provide the Services. All such licenses shall expire upon termination
of the Services Agreement.  

On
April 28, 2014, we purchased a copy of the source code for the Ortsbo property and all the rights associated with it.  

On
July 16, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the intellectual property assets of Ortsbo which closed
on September 15, 2015. The purchased assets include US No. 8,983,850 B2, US Patent No. 8,917,631 B2, US Patent No. 9,053,097 B2,
and other intellectual property including Ecommerce and Customer Care know-how (Proprietary lexicons and linguistic databases
that integrate into our language services platform). Upon completion of the transaction on September 15, 2015 the amended Services
Agreement was terminated.   

We
continue to engage in activities to maintain and further build differentiated technologies that increase our intellectual properties.  

Government
Regulation    

We
are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business
on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm
our business. These may involve user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution,
electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment
services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign
data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal
and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the
application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving
industry in which we operate. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state
legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. For example, a revision to the 1995
European Union Data Protection Directive is currently being considered by legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational
requirements for data processors and significant penalties for non-compliance.  

Legal
Proceedings    

None.  

Registration
Statement    

On October 3, 2016, we
filed a request to withdraw our previously filed Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-207292), with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the    SEC   ).  On October 3, 2016 the Company filed a new Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No.333-213947) (the    Registration Statement   ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
for up to 14,840,964 shares of our Company s $0.0001 par value per share common stock (the  Common Stock ) issuable
to certain selling stockholders that are issued and outstanding upon conversion of promissory notes, related past due accrued
interest and penalties and/or warrants currently held by those selling stockholders, specifically (i) 8,227,821 shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding (ii) 907,200 shares of Common Stock issuable to them upon exercise of promissory notes (iii) 273,272
shares of Common Stock issuable underlying past due accrued interest and penalties and (iv) 5,432,671 shares of Common Stock issuable
to them upon exercise of warrants. The warrants have an exercise price varying from $0.25 to $2.20 per share (subject to adjustment).
The Registration Statement has not yet been declared effective. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS    

Three
months ended August 31, 2016   

Revenues    

We
are in the process of commercialization of our various product offerings. We had revenues of $100,068 and $758,159 for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively. $53,390 of revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2016
related to professional services provided for Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc. ( ICE ). We billed ICE $59,681
for three months ended August 31, 2016, that has not been recorded as revenue in our financial statements. Our company has received
acknowledgment and acceptance of the services performed during the three months ended August 31, 2016. $59,390 of revenue recognized
from ICE is based on payments received against the outstanding billings. Comparative period revenues resulted from the professional
services related to the Digital Widget Factory (Belize) ( DWF ) program. The DWF assets were acquired by ICE effective
February 29, 2016 and thus no further billings were made to DWF since that date. Billings as part of professional and language
services for the program subsequent to February 29, 2016 were through ICE, and were expected and have been lower than the average
billings to DWF. Our management has focused on developing relationships with large commercial partners and influencers, which
has delayed revenue realization from prospective customers in recent quarters.  

Cost
of revenue    

We
incurred costs of revenues of $6,543 and $128,471, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.
These costs were directly attributable to the revenues generated in the applicable periods and resulted in a gross profit of $93,525
and $629,688, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Total
operating expenses    

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, total operating expenses were $1,408,214 and $856,290, respectively.  

For
the three months ended August 31, 2016, the operating expenses consisted of marketing expense of $10,372, research and development
expenses of $120,204, general and administrative expenses of $400,516, professional fees of $85,734, consulting fees of $49,726,
depreciation of $1,025, amortization of $266,649, and stock based compensation of $473,988. For the comparable three months ended
August 31, 2015 the operating expenses consisted of marketing expenses of $102,785, research and development expenses of $95,070,
general and administrative expenses of $352,133, professional fees of $91,569, consulting fees of $102,000, depreciation of $91,
amortization of $nil and stock based compensation of $112,642.  

Marketing
 Expenses  

The
reduction in marketing expenses of $92,413 or 90% is due mainly to a realignment of spending by the company. In the three months
period ending August 31, 2015 we incurred higher costs as a result of promoting the Yappn brand through consultants and various
promotional expenses. In three months ending August 31, 2016, we substantially reduced the spending on consultants engaged in marketing
activities and focused our efforts on operationalizing the current products based on more direct sales channels.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses increased by $25,134 or 26% in the three months ended August 31, 2016 over the three months ended August
31, 2015. Our research and development costs in the comparative period are partially for fees to technology consultants from Intertainment
Media and Ortsbo, with higher weighting on our own employees and arm s length third party consultants. There were no research
and development costs from Intertainment Media and Ortsbo in fiscal 2017. There were significant costs incurred in development
of the various technologies supporting the business towards the commencement of commercialization. Many of these costs will not
continue into the future, however there will continue to be maintenance and ongoing development customization to ensure our technology
solutions meet required standards for our current and prospective customers.  

General
and administrative expenses    

General
and administrative expenses increased by $ 48,383 or 14% in the three months ended August 31, 2016 over the three months ended
August 31, 2015 including executive and office salaries, administrative services accounting and finance as well as general office
expenses or costs. These costs have increased mainly due to employee related expenses with the hiring of senior management personnel
in late fiscal 2016 even though the overall headcount has decreased. Certain other costs have been reduced or eliminated such
as billings from Intertainment Media under the services agreement and employee headcount in the US office. Billings from Intertainment
Media ceased due to the acquisition of the Intellectual Property and assets from Ortsbo on September 15, 2015 and the subsequent
cancellation of the Services Agreement. We anticipate that costs in fiscal 2017 will be relatively consistent period over period
as we continue to work to develop a customer base and meet the needs of investors to finance our operation. Upon further significant
increases in revenue, management will continue to hire qualified personnel, but the growth of this cost, we believe, will be far
less than the impact to Net Loss.  

Professional
fees   

Professional fees decreased
by $5,835 or 6% three months ended August 31, 2016 over the three months ended August 31, 2015 and includes audit and audit related
services pertaining to the year-end audits, and legal fees related to both ongoing operational compliance for the business and
for financing closings. Although audit related fees have generally stayed consistent, the comparative period had less audit expense
due to timing of billing and the offsetting higher legal fees were a result of our fees various financings that closed during
fiscal 2016. 

Consulting
fees   

Consulting
fees went down by $52,274 or 51% and are mainly due to a significant reduction in spending on consultants. In the comparative
period, Company had six different consultants engaged whereas in the current three month period, Company has only two consultants
engaged. This is expected to be consistent in the near term due to the Company s overall realignment of spending.  

Amortization
of Intangible Assets   

Amortization
of $266,649 relates entirely to Technology and Intellectual Property purchased during prior fiscal 2016 which we are amortizing
over 5 years on a straight-line basis. On September 15, 2015, we finalized our purchase of Intellectual property assets of Ortsbo,
Inc. pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed and closed on July 15, 2015.  

Stock
based compensation   

Stock
based compensation increased by $361,346 or 321%. This increase is due to the issuances of certain awards in the three month period
ended August 31, 2016, for issuance of stock options, issuance of warrants to a new advisory board member, as well as continued
vesting of existing options. Overall values ascribed will be different for each period based on the underlying assumptions used
at the time of each grant. The stock options expense is determined using the acceptable binomial tree valuation method, which
is an acceptable method under US GAAP.  

Total
other income and expenses    

Other
(income) expenses totaled $468,582 and $(393,250), for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.
The change of $861,832 is primarily due to interest expense, change in fair value of derivative liabilities and convertible notes,
and miscellaneous (income)/expense. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, total other (income)/expense consisted of interest
expense of $287,053, financing expense on issuance of convertible promissory notes and common stock totaling $nil, a loss resulting
from the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities and convertible notes of $172,260, prepayment fees on convertible
notes with floating strike prices of $nil, and other miscellaneous expense of $9,269. During the three months ended August 31,
2015, total other (income)/expense consisted of interest expense of $153,985 and financing expenses on the issuance of convertible
promissory notes and common stock totaling $89,490, a gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities
and convertible notes of $(801,639), prepayment fees on variable notes of $177,232, and miscellaneous other income of $(12,318).  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense increased by $133,068 or 86% for the three months ended August 31, 2016 over the three months ended August 31, 2015. The
significant increase is mainly due to additional financings closed in fiscal 2016. We closed multiple secured debenture financings
totaling approximately $6.7 million, most of which is new debt for the Company. Additionally, we incurred a higher penalty interest
on convertible debentures from fiscal 2014 that reached maturity in late fiscal 2016.  

Financing
expense on issuance of convertible promissory notes and common stock   

Financing
expense decreased by $89,490 or 100% as we did not fund the Company through variables rate notes in fiscal 2016 whereas there
was still a minor financing completed on a variable rate convertible note in the three month period ended August 31, 2015. The
expense is a function of the underlying assumptions at the time of the grant. It is mainly driven by the strike price of the instrument
and the stock price at the time of the grant. As this is a non-cash expense, based on financings and model outputs it is hard
to estimate variability for this account.  

Change
in fair value of convertible promissory notes and convertible secured debentures   

Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities and convertible promissory notes expense was a loss resulting in incremental change in
the recognized gain/loss by $973,899 in the three months ended August 31, 2016 over three months ended August 31, 2015 as the
existing debt instruments continued to have fair value adjustments in addition to the new secured debentures that were issued
during the current fiscal year. The total fair value change is a gain in the comparative period due to the revaluations on the
variable conversion priced notes and the underlying assumptions used to value them using the binomial tree valuation method which
includes elapsed time, and market price decreases.  

Payment
fees on variable conversion priced notes   

Payment
fees on variable conversion priced notes is significantly lower by $177,232 or 100% in three months ended August 31, 2016 over
three months ended August 31, 2015 as we repaid the variable conversion priced notes in the prior fiscal year. As of August 31,
2016, we do not have any further variable conversion priced notes.  

Miscellaneous
expense/(income)   

Miscellaneous
expense/(income) was a loss resulting in incremental change in the recognized gain/loss by $21,587 in three months ended August
31, 2016 over three months ended August 31, 2015. The expense/(income) is largely a function of foreign exchange expense/(income)
and write-off of payables that Company does not expect to pay either due to a settlement or management has concluded the obligations
are barred by the statute of limitations. A small portion of the foreign exchange is a cash expense in bank spread for currency
variance conversion between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar. The remaining foreign exchange expense/ (income) was incurred
on changes in the foreign exchange and the foreign denominated liabilities.  

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we raised $70,848 through private placement financing of common stock and warrants. During
the three months ended August 31, 2015, we raised $486,179, in net cash from short term notes payable, line of credit, convertible
notes, secured notes and debentures through normal channels, and private placements of common stock and warrants. For accounting
purposes, since certain financial instruments had convertible provisions they are treated as derivatives liabilities and are valued
using a binomial lattice fair value model upon inception and where applicable adjusted accordingly to market at the close of the
period. The financing expense associated with the capital raises and prior obligations were $nil and $89,490 for three months
ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.  

For
the three months ended August 31, 2016, the gain from fair value adjustment largely relates to accretion fair value changes on
various convertible notes. In the comparative period in 2015, there was a significant decline in the market price compared to
those prices that were in effect at the time of the original issuance of these convertible instruments. The changes in market
value of our common stock coupled with the other parameters used in the binomial lattice model for all instruments marked to market,
resulted in an expense of $172,260 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 in contrast to a gain of $801,639 for the three
months ended August 31, 2015, for a change of $973,899.  

Net
loss and comprehensive loss    

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, we had net loss/(income)  and comprehensive loss/(income)
of $1,783,271 and $(166,648) respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of August 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $38,914, which is a decrease of $409,661 from the ending cash balance of
$448,575 as of May 31, 2016. We do not have sufficient funds to fund our operations over the next twelve months. There can be
no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. Since we have no other financial arrangements currently in
effect, our inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a
viable going concern.  

To
fund our operations, we raised $70,848 through private placement financing of common stock and warrants in the three months ended
August 31, 2016. During the three months ended August 31, 2015 we issued secured debentures, and convertible debt instruments
for gross cash receipts of $486,179.   

We
have used this financing for funding operations and replacing short term high cost debt instruments with lower cost longer term
financial instruments where the economics made sense.  

We
estimate we will need additional capital to cover our ongoing expenses and to successfully market our product offerings. This
is only an estimate and may change as we receive feedback from customers and have a better understanding of the demand for our
application and the ability to generate revenues from our new products. Both of these factors may change and we may not be able
to raise the necessary capital and if we are able to, that it may not be at favorable rates.  

On
July 15, 2015, we completed a secured debt financing of $4.5 Million of 12% Secured Debentures. The Secured Debentures had an
original maturity date of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the holders of the Secured
Debentures (the  Holders ) agreed to extend the maturity date of the Secured Debentures from December 31, 2015 to
July 15, 2020, and were provided with the right to amend the Secured Debenture such that a Holder shall have the right, at any
time after the earlier of (i) six (6) months from the date of first issuance of any subsequent Debentures; and (ii) June 30, 2016,
to require the Company to satisfy the outstanding obligations underlying the Secured Debenture; provided, however, that at least
two thirds (66.67%) of the Holders of the principal amount of the Secured Debentures consent to a put of their Secured Debentures
to our company.  

We
received $2.5 million of this financing in the form of cash and cash commitments, including conversion of the short term loans
obtained on May 11, 2015 and June 19, 2015. $2,000,000 of the $4.5 million financing is conversion of a portion of our existing
debt that remained in the secured debenture. $925,000 was repaid out of the secured debenture, in the form of cash in the amount
of $465,000 with the remainder in the form of the release of secured deposit that was applied against accounts receivable. On
September 15, 2015, we closed the acquisition of intellectual property from Ortsbo Inc., and as part of this closing, assumed
debt and non-controlling equity interests from Ortsbo in the amount of $975,388 that was immediately subscribed to a second tranche
of secured debentures. The secured debentures balance as at August 31, 2016, was $4,550,388.  

On
December 30, 2015, we completed a secured debenture and warrant financing for $2,040,000 through the offering of units by way
of private placement, with each unit consisting of (i) a 12% secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of five years
from issuance and (ii) ten (10) five year common share purchase warrants, vesting in 1/3 increments and having an exercise price
of $0.01 per share. The units were sold at $1.00 per unit. This closing includes conversion of $1,201,000 in short term loans
advanced during the quarter prior to the closing of this secured debenture. On May 1, 2015 the Company closed a final tranche
of this financing for $370,468 which includes $170,468 in cash and $200,000 in settlement of a consultant obligation. The $200,000
debenture did not include the attached warrants as they were waived by the consultant.  

During
the three months ended August 31, 2015, we raised $90,750 via various convertible promissory notes and debentures, and $1,830,695
from secured debentures. The Company also repaid $340,846 of various convertible promissory notes and debentures, $942,025 of
line of credit, and $152,395 of short term loans.  

Going
Concern Consideration   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We experienced
negative cash flows from operations since inception and have incurred a deficit of $23,447,696 through August 31, 2016.  

As of August 31, 2016,
we had a working capital deficit of $1,407,491. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities
was $471,341. Management expects to have similar cash needs for the next twelve months. At the present time, we do not have sufficient
funds to fund operations over the next twelve months. 

Implementation
of our business plan will require additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance that additional financing
can be obtained on acceptable terms. We have realized limited revenues to cover our operating costs. As such, we have incurred
an operating loss since inception. This and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to meet our obligations, to obtain additional financing as may
be required and ultimately to attain profitability. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management
plans to meet its operating cash flow requirements from financing activities until the future operating activities become sufficient
to support the business to enable us to continue as a going concern. Management continues to work on generating operating cash
flows from the commercialization of its business. Until those cash flows are sufficient, we will pursue other financing when deemed
necessary.  

Management
is pursuing a number of different financing opportunities in order to execute our business plan. These include, short term debt
arrangements, convertible debt arrangements, common share equity financings, either through a private placement or through the
public markets. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we raised $70,848 through various financial instruments, net of
repayments. Subsequent to the three months ended August 31, 2016, we raised $200,000 in cash proceeds.  

There
can be no assurance that the raising of future equity or debt will be successful or that our anticipated financing will be available
in the future, at terms satisfactory to us. Failure to achieve the equity and financing at satisfactory terms and amounts could
have a materially adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot successfully raise additional capital
and implement its strategic development plan, its liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and
adversely affected, and we may have to cease operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

None.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls
and procedures, as well as internal control over financial reporting, may not prevent or detect all inaccurate statements or omissions.  

Our
management, with the supervision and participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2016 were effective such that the information required
to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives
of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.  

(b)
Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to have a materially affect, on our internal control over financial reporting.
