NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of Nestor Partners  (the  Partnership ) financial condition at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 (unaudited) and the results of its operations for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (unaudited). These financial statements present the results of interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ( U.S. GAAP ) in the United States of America (the  U.S. ), as detailed in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The Partnership enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification provisions. The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. The Partnership does not anticipate recognizing any loss related to these arrangements. 

The Income Taxes topic of the Codification clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This requires that the Partnership recognize in its financial statements the impact of any uncertain tax positions. Based on a review of the Partnership s open tax years, 2012 to 2015, Millburn Ridgefield Corporation (the  General Partner ) has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions were required. 

There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnership's critical accounting policies, off-balance sheet arrangements or disclosure of contractual obligations as reported in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015. 

2. FAIR VALUE 

The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Codification defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3: Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

In determining fair value, the Partnership separates its investments into two categories: cash instruments and derivative contracts. 

Cash Instruments   The Partnership s cash instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are typically valued using quoted market prices. The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include U.S. government obligations and an investment in a quoted short-term U.S. government securities money market fund. The General Partner does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments even in situations where the Partnership holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 

Derivative Contracts   Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded futures contracts are valued based on quoted closing settlement prices and typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Spot currency contracts are valued based on current market prices ( Spot Price ). Forward currency contracts are valued based on pricing models that consider the Spot Price, plus the financing cost or benefit ( Forward Point ). Forward Points from the quotation service providers are generally in periods of one month, two months, three months,   six   months  , nine months and twelve months forward while the contractual forward delivery dates for the forward currency contracts traded by the Partnership may be in between these periods. The General Partner s policy to determine fair value for forward currency contracts involves first calculating the number of months from the date the forward currency contract is being valued to its maturity date ( Months to Maturity ), then identifying the forward currency contracts for the two forward months that are closest to the Months to Maturity ( Forward Month Contracts ). Linear interpolation is then performed between the dates of these two Forward Month Contracts to calculate the interpolated Forward Point. Model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

10   

Investment Company Status: The Partnership adopted Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2013-08,  Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements  and based on the General Partner s assessment, the Partnership has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.      

During the three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2. The following tables represent the Partnership s investments by hierarchical level as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   in valuing the Partnership s investments at fair value. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Partnership held no assets or liabilities in Level 3. 

11   

3. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 

The Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification requires qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. 

The Partnership s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Partnership s open positions, and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades. 

The Partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures and forward contracts on currencies, energies, grains, interest rates, livestock, metals, softs and stock indices. The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Partnership at   September 30, 2016  , by market sector: 

Agricultural (grains, livestock and softs)   The Partnership s primary exposure is to agricultural price movements which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions as well as supply and demand factors. 

12   

Currencies   Exchange rate risk is a principal market exposure of the Partnership. The Partnership s currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. The fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes, as well as political and general economic conditions. The Partnership trades in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates e.g., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 

Energies   The Partnership s primary energy market exposure is to gas and oil price movements often resulting from political developments in the oil producing countries and economic conditions worldwide. Energy prices are volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market. 

Interest rates   Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the Partnership and indirectly the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country, as well as relative interest rate movements between countries, may materially impact the Partnership s profitability. The Partnership s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in countries or regions, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and the Eurozone. However, the Partnership also may take positions in futures contracts on the government debt of other nations. The General Partner anticipates that interest rates in these industrialized countries or areas, both long-term and short-term, will remain the primary interest rate market exposure of the Partnership for the foreseeable future. 

Metals   The Partnership s metals market exposure is to fluctuations in the price of aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, platinum, silver, tin and zinc. 

Stock indices   The Partnership s equity exposure, through stock index futures, is to equity price risk in the major industrialized countries, as well as other countries. 

The Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification requires entities to recognize in the Statements of Financial Condition all derivative contracts as assets or liabilities. Fair values of futures and forward currency contracts in an asset position by counterparty are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition as  Net unrealized appreciation on open futures and forward currency contracts.  Fair values of futures and forward currency contracts in a liability position by counterparty are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition as  Net unrealized depreciation on open futures and forward currency contracts.  The Partnership s policy regarding fair value measurement is discussed in the Fair Value and Disclosures note, contained herein. 

Since the derivatives held or sold by the Partnership are for speculative trading purposes, the derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging guidance. Accordingly, all realized gains and losses, as well as any change in net unrealized gains or losses on open positions from the preceding period, are recognized as part of the Partnership s trading gains and losses in the Statements of Operations. 

13   

The following tables present the fair value of open futures and forward currency contracts, held long or sold short, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Fair value is presented on a gross basis even though the contracts are subject to master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Statements of Financial Condition. 

14   

The effect of trading futures and forward currency contracts is represented on the Statements of   Operations for the three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as  Net realized gains (losses) on closed positions: Futures and forward currency contracts  and  Net change in unrealized: Futures and forward currency contracts.  These trading gains and losses are detailed below.  

Trading gains (losses) of futures and forward currency contracts for the three   and nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    

The following table presents average notional value by sector of open futures and forward currency contracts for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in U.S. dollars. The Partnership s average   net asset value for the nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $153,000,000   and   $135,000,000  , respectively. 

Notional values in the interest rate sector were calculated by converting the notional value in local currency of open interest rate futures positions with maturities less than   10   years to   10  -year equivalent fixed income instruments and translated to U.S. dollars at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The 10-year note is often used as a benchmark for many types of fixed-income instruments and the General Partner believes it is a more meaningful representation of notional values of the Partnership s open interest rate positions. 

15   

The customer agreements between the Partnership, the futures clearing brokers, including Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG), and SG Americas Securities, LLC., as well as the FX prime broker, Deutsche Bank AG, and the swap dealer, Morgan Stanley   Co., LLC, give the Partnership the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures and foreign currency contracts. The Partnership netted, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward currency contracts on the Statements of Financial Condition as the criteria under ASC 210-20,  Balance Sheet,  were met. The Partnership ceased clearing trades through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC during September 2015. 

16   

17   

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk is normally reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to futures transactions since typically the collective credit of the members of the exchange is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange. 

The General Partner seeks to minimize credit risk primarily by depositing and maintaining the Partnership s assets at financial institutions and trading counterparties which the General Partner believes to be creditworthy. In addition, for OTC forward currency contracts, the Partnership enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties. Collateral posted at the various counterparties for trading of futures and forward currency contracts includes cash and U.S. Treasury notes. 

The Partnership s forward currency trading activities are cleared through Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) and Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS ). The Partnership s concentration of credit risk associated with DB or MS nonperformance includes unrealized gains inherent in such contracts, which are recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition plus the value of margin or collateral held by DB and MS. The amount of such credit risk was   $5,976,006   and   $14,631,693   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

18   

4. PROFIT SHARE 

The following table indicates the total profit share earned and   accrued during the three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Profit share earned (from Limited Partners  redemptions) is credited to the New Profit Memo Account as defined in the Partnership s Agreement of Limited Partnership.    

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Partnership pays administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services, up to   0.25   of   1%   per annum of the Partnership's average month-end net assets. A portion of such expenses are paid to an affiliate of the General Partner, The Millburn Corporation ( TMC ), for providing accounting services to the Partnership. The following table indicates the portion relating to administrative expenses as well as the portion relating to legal and accounting services provided to the Partnership by TMC during the three   and nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The General Partner pays all administrative expenses in excess of   0.25   of   1%   per annum of the Partnership's average month-end net assets. 

Limited partnership interests ( Interests ) sold through selling agents engaged by the General Partner are generally subject to a   2.5%   redemption charge for redemptions made prior to the end of the twelfth month following their sale. All redemption charges will be paid to the General Partner. At     September 30, 2016     and   December 31, 2015  ,    $  0   was owe  d to the General Partner. 

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Reference is made to Item 1, "Financial Statements." The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in connection with, the following analysis. 

OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW 

Due to the nature of the Partnership's business, its results of operations depend on the General Partner's ability to recognize and capitalize on trends and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the global capital and commodity markets. The General Partner's investment and trading methods are confidential so that substantially the only information that can be furnished regarding the Partnership's results of operations is contained in the performance record of its trading. Unlike operating businesses, general economic or seasonal conditions do not directly affect the profit potential of the Partnership and its past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The General Partner believes, however,  

19   

that there are certain market conditions, for example, markets with strong price trends, in which the Partnership has a better likelihood of being profitable than in others. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Interests may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed as of the end, of each month. 

The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and charges. Within broad ranges of capitalization, the General Partner s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership. 

The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any). The Partnership does not engage in borrowing. 

The Partnership trades futures,   forward  ,   and spot contracts on interest rate instruments, agricultural commodities, currencies, metals, energy and stock indices, and forward contracts on currencies, and may trade options on the foregoing and swaps thereon. Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) and the potential inability of counterparties or brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk). Market risk is generally measured by the face amount of the futures positions acquired and the volatility of the markets traded. The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with these instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on these positions plus the value of the margin or collateral held by the counterparty. The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with OTC transactions because exchanges typically (but not universally) provide clearinghouse arrangements in which the collective credit (in some cases limited in amount, in some cases not) of the members of the exchange is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange. In most OTC transactions, on the other hand, traders must rely (typically but not universally) solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties. Margins which may be subject to loss in the event of a default are generally required in exchange trading and counterparties may require margin or collateral in the OTC markets. 

The General Partner has procedures in place to control market risk, although there can be no assurance that they will, in fact, succeed in doing so. These procedures primarily focus on (1) real time monitoring of open positions; (2) diversifying positions among various markets; (3) limiting the assets committed as margin or collateral, generally within a range of 5% to 35% of an account s net assets, though the amount may at any time be higher; and (4) prohibiting pyramiding - that is, using unrealized profits in a particular market as margin for additional positions in the same market. The General Partner attempts to control credit risk by causing the Partnership to deal exclusively with large, well-capitalized financial institutions as brokers and counterparties. 

The financial instruments traded by the Partnership contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures,   forward  ,   and spot contracts or the Partnership s satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition of the Partnership. 

Due to the nature of the Partnership s business, substantially all its assets are represented by cash, cash equivalents  ,   and U.S. government obligations while the Partnership maintains its market exposure through open futures,   forward  ,   and spot currency contract positions. 

The Partnership s futures contracts are settled by offset and are cleared by the exchange clearinghouse function. Open futures positions are marked to market each trading day and the Partnership s trading accounts are debited or credited accordingly. Options on futures contracts are settled either by offset or by exercise. If an option on a future is exercised, the Partnership is assigned a position in the underlying future which is then settled by offset. The Partnership s spot and forward currency transactions conducted in the interbank market are settled by netting offsetting positions or payment obligations and by cash payments. 

The value of the Partnership s cash and financial instruments is not materially affected by inflation. Changes in interest rates, which are often associated with inflation, could cause the value of certain of the Partnership s debt securities to decline, but only to a limited extent. More importantly, changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down market price trends during which the Partnership s profit potential generally increases. However, inflation can also give rise to markets which have numerous short price trends followed by rapid reversals, markets in which the Partnership is likely to suffer losses. 

The Partnership s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, including U.S. government securities or securities issued by federal agencies (or, to a limited extent, foreign government securities in connection with trading on non-U.S. exchanges), other Commodity Futures Trading Commission authorized investments or bank held or certain other money market instruments (e.g., bankers acceptances and Eurodollar or other time deposits), which are used to margin the Partnership s futures,   forward  ,   and spot currency positions and withdrawn, as necessary, to pay redemptions and expenses. Other than potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, due, for example, to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership s futures,   forward   and spot trading, the Partnership s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. 

During it  s operations for the three   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the numerous markets traded by the General Partner. 

20   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Partnership records its t  ransactions in futures, forward   and spot contracts, including related income and expenses, on a trade date basis. Open futures contracts traded on an exchange are valued at fair value, which is based on the closing settlement price on the exchange where the futures contract is traded by the Partnership on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined. Open spot currency contracts are valued based on the current Spot Price. Open forward currency contracts are recorded at fair value, based on pricing models that consider the Spot Price and Forward Point. Spot Prices and Forward Points for open forward currency contracts are generally based on the   median of the   average midpoint of bid/ask quotat  ions at the last minute   ending at 3:00 P.M. New York time provided by widely used quotation service providers on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined. Forward Points from the quotation service providers are generally in periods of one month, two months, three months,   six   months  , nine months and twelve months forward while the contractual forward delivery dates for the forward currency contracts traded by the Partnership may be in between these periods. The General Partner s policy to determine fair value for forward currency contracts involves first calculating the number of Months to Maturity, then identifying the Forward Month Contracts. Linear interpolation is then performed between the dates of these two Forward Month Contracts to calculate the interpolated Forward Point. The General Partner will also compare the calculated price to the forward currency prices provided by dealers to determine whether the calculated price is fair and reasonable  . 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  

THREE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $  1,730,033   was attributable to net income after profit share of $  1,649,037   and contributions of $  3,512,155   which was partially offset by withdrawals of $  3,431  ,159  . 

Brokerage fees are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by tr  ading performance, contributions and withdrawals  . Brokerage fees for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased    $  152,238   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  .    The in  crease was due   to   a  n   in  crease in average net assets of the Partnership during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . 

The Partnership pays administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services, up to 0.25 of 1% per annum of the Partnership s average month-end net assets. Administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   in  creased $  17,139   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . The   increase   was due mainly to a  n     increase   in the Partnership s average net assets during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . 

Interest income is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Partnership s brokers and custodian. Interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d $  110,805   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . This   increase   was due predominantly to a  n     increase   in   short-term U.S. Treasury yields during   the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  ,        and partially due to an increase in average net assets over the same period. 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,    the Partnership experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $  2,633,392   from its trading operations (including foreign exchange translations and U.S. Treasury notes). Brokerage fees of $  948,536  , administrative expenses of $  102,246  , custody fees and other expenses of $  7,252   and an accrued profit share to the General Partner of $  115,246   were incurred. The Partnership s gains achieved from trading operations, in addition to interest income of $  188,925  , were   partially offset by the Partnership expenses resulting in net income after profit share to the General Partner of $  1,649,037  . An analysis of the trading gain (loss) by sector is as follows:

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $  25,384,650   was attributable to net income after profit share of $  22,426,002   and contributions of $  10,277,008   which was partially offset by withdrawals of $  7,318,360  . 

Brokerage fees are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by tr  ading performance, contributions and withdrawals  . Brokerage fees for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d $  328,839   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . The   increase   was due   to    a  n     increase   in average net assets of the Partnership during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . 

The Partnership pays administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services, up to 0.25 of 1% per annum of the Partnership s average month-end net assets. Administrative expenses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d $  35,597   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . The   increase   was due mainly to a  n     increase   in the Partnership s average net assets during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . 

Interest income is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Partnership s brokers and custodian. Interest income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d $  255,049   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  . This   increase   was due predominantly to a  n     increase   in   short-term U.S. Treasury yields during   the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the corresponding period in   2015  , and partially due to an in  crease in average net assets over the same period. 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,    the Partnership experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $  27,335,706   from its trading operations (including foreign exchange translations and U.S. Treasury notes). Brokerage fees of $  2,689,578  , administrative expenses of $  290,096  , custody fees and other expenses of $  20,084   and an accrued profit share to the General Partner of $  2,338,360   were incurred. The Partnership s gains achieved from trading operations, in addition to interest income of $  428,414  , were   partially offset by the Partnership expenses resulting in net income after profit share to the General Partner of $  2  2,426,002  .

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION    2016 

Three   months ended   September 30, 2016 

The Partnership was profitable during the third quarter largely due to gains from long equity and lo  ng interest futures positions.   Trading of currency forwards   and grain and livestock futures   were each slightly profitable.   On the other hand, trading of energy and metal futures were unprofitable. Trading of soft commodity futures was nearly flat. 

Markets were unsettled throughout the period by a number of factors including: the repercussions of the   U.K.   voters  decision   to have the U.K. leave   the   European Union,   continued market schizophrenia about an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve ( Fed ), the persistent discussions within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) about a potential production cut, and concerns abou  t the upcoming U.S. elections.   Moreover, as interest rates, the U.S. dollar, and energy prices reacted to these influences, there were secondary repercussions of those prices in other markets.  

Long positions in German, French, Italian, British, Japanese and Canadian note and bond futures were profitable as sluggish growth and inflation kept the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan on ac  commodative policy paths.   Meanwhile, the Fed continued to waffle on if and when it will raise interest rates, even though   U.S.   growth and inflation data showed imp  rovement in the third quarter.   As a result, long positions in U.S. note, bond and short-term interest rate futures posted losses, especially in August and early September when U.S. interest rates rose in anticipation   of a near term Fed rate hike.   After the Fed failed to deliver that increase at its September meeting, those U.S. losses were reduced somewhat.  

Though the path was uneven, improving U.S. eco  nomic data, continued developed-  world accommodative monetary policy, and higher energy prices that underpinned commodity producers led to profits on long positions in U.S., Canadian and Australian eq  uity futures.   A weaker pound sterling and policy accommodation from the Bank of England produced a gain for a   long U.K. stock futures trade.   Long Hong Kong and Taiwanese futures posit  ions were profitable, as well.   Meanwhile, short Japanese equity futures positions were unprofitable. 

Foreign   exchange trading was vo  latile and results were mixed.   A short Mexican peso trade was profitable as   U.S.   political problems and somewhat slower growth combined with the trade and immigration concerns raised by the   U.S. presidential   campaign   of Donald Trump   to undermine the peso.  Rising energy and commodity prices and the lack of a Fed rate hike led to profits on long positions in high yield and commodity currencies including the: New Zealand and Australian dollars, Russian ruble, South African rand, Indian rupee, and Israeli shekel, especially in September.  A short sterling trade was also profitable, as were short euro trades versus the No  rwegian and Polish currencies.   Short U.S. dollar trades against the euro, yen, Canadian dollar, and several other units produced largely offsetting losses. 

With corn inventories at 30-  year highs and with worldwide grain production expected to increase 10% this year, short corn and wheat positions were profitable, particularly in July and August  .    Trading the soybean complex beans, meal and oil generate  d a partially offsetting loss.   Short cattle and hog positions were profitable.  

Energy prices were volatile with Brent and WTI crude vac  illating in the $40-$50 range.   Record levels of production, high inventories, a glut of refined products in July, and bouts of U.S. dollar strength   periodically depressed prices.   On the other hand, persistent talk of production control agreements within OPEC and between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, and periods of U.S. dollar weaknes  s underpinned prices at times.   As a result, long energy trades were unprofitable in July and September, and short energy trades were unprofitable, especially in August.  

Metal prices also experienced volatility during the July-Septem  ber period.   Losses from a short copper position and from trading gold, platinum, lead and nickel were marginally larger than the gains from trading silver and from a long zinc position. 

Three months ended June 30, 2016  

The Partnership was profitable during the second quarter with gains from long interest rate futures positions again leading the way. Trading of equity futures and foreign exchange forwards added fractionally to the gain. Meanwhile, trading of commodity futures was also slightly profitable as the gains from trading grain and soft commodity futures outdistanced the losses from the energy and metals sectors.    

Long positions in U.S., German, French, British, Canadian and Australian interest rate futures were profitable, particularly after the U.K. voters  surprise vote to have the U.K. leave the European Union (the  EU ) produced a flight to safety and an expectation that easier monetary policy would be forthcoming rather broadly going forward. The weak June employment report in the U.S. that prompted another delay in the Federal Reserve ( Fed ) rate rise program had underpinned the prices of note, bond and short term interest rate futures earlier. The fact that growth and inflation have failed to accelerate convincingly, and that the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development among others have lowered their global growth projections also supported fixed income prices.   

Currency trading was particularly volatile as the U.S. dollar was buffeted to and fro during the quarter. The U.S. currency would strengthen whenever Fed Governors hinted that a rate increase was possible, such as in late April-early May and in late May-early June, but fall when those expectations faded. For example, after an extraordinarily weak U.S. June jobs report, such expectations were put on hold and the U.S. dollar weakened. Then, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited real concerns that the  temporary headwinds  that had blunted the Fed s rate rise program  

23   

might actually reflect Lawrence Summers   secular stagnation  rather than just passing concerns, the U.S. dollar softened further. However, following the surprise decision of the British electorate to leave the EU, a flight to safety and quality prompted an upward U-turn for the U.S. dollar. Overall, long U.S. dollar trades against the pound sterling and Swiss franc, and short U.S. dollar trades relative to the Brazilian real, New Zealand dollar and South African rand were profitable. On the other hand, short U.S. dollar trades versus the Australian, Israeli, Mexican, Polish and Swedish currencies produced losses. Trading the euro against the U.S. dollar, Polish zloty and Turkish lira was also unprofitable.    

Trading of equity futures was fractionally profitable after a volatile quarter. Following a strong rebound from the February lows, equity trading was unsettled periodically by currency turmoil, the uncertainty surrounding  the monetary policies of the Bank of Japan, the Fed, European Central Bank and the Bank of England, worries about future growth and inflation outlooks, and actualized weakness in corporate profits. Still, gains on long positions in non-tech U.S., Canadian and British stock futures and from a short VIX trade outpaced the losses from trading of a number of European and Asian indices.    

Long positions in soybeans and soybean meal were profitable as bad weather in Brazil and Argentina underpinned prices for most of the period.  A long sugar position posted a gain when prices rose as production in Thailand, India and Brazil was hurt by El Ni o weather influences.    

A short natural gas trade registered a loss as warmer than normal weather boosted prices, especially in June. Trading of London gas oil, heating oil, RBOB gasoline and WTI crude were also unprofitable, while a long position in Brent crude produced a partially offsetting gain.    

Short positions in gold, silver, platinum, palladium and copper were each slightly unprofitable. 

Three months ended March 31, 2016       

During a quarter of extreme market volatility, the Partnership registered strong performance led by gains on long interest rate futures positions.  Trading of equity futures and foreign exchange forwards were also profitable. Meanwhile, commodity futures were essentially flat as a fractional gain from trading energy futures was offset by small losses from trading metal and agricultural futures.    

Concerns about global growth that International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde described as   too low, too fragile and facing increased risks to its durability  ,  combined with doubts about policy makers  competence and capabilities, generated strong demand for government securities for most of the quarter. The demand for this debt was underpinned when: the Bank of Japan moved official interest rates into negative territory at the end of January; the Bank of England delayed any potential rate increase; the European Central Bank (the  ECB ) and People s Bank of China (the  PBOC ) eased monetary policy in March; and a speech by Federal Reserve ( Fed ) Chair Janet Yellen squashed expectations for a near term Fed rate increase.  Consequently, long positions in U.S., German, French, Italian, British, Japanese, Australian and Canadian notes and bonds were profitable. Long positions in short-term dollar and sterling interest rate futures were also profitable.    

Equity markets were particularly volatile during the first quarter of 2016, tracing out a classic V-shaped path. The tumultuous first half of the period saw many equity indices experiencing multiyear lows before rebounding impressively over the second half of the quarter. Early on, weak economic data out of China and concerns about official policy decisions generated a renewed rout in Chinese equities and the yuan. These events, combined with a further collapse in energy prices; worries that Fed interest rate increases and a stronger dollar might impede global growth; and a halt in corporate profit growth, produced a broad, sharp equity selloff. Later, equity prices recovered as energy prices rebounded, the ECB, PBOC and Fed displayed easier policy tendencies, the U.S. dollar eased and growth concerns moderated. On balance, short positions in Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, Singaporean, Indian, and Spanish futures were profitable. Trading of U.S. and Canadian stock index futures also posted gains.  On the other hand, short positions in Dutch and South African futures, a long U.K stock futures position, and trading of the European stoxx future resulted in somewhat offsetting losses.  

Foreign exchange trading was also volatile. At the beginning of the year, given the search for safety, declining oil prices and the Fed s  relatively hawkish  policy position, the U.S. dollar strengthened. Thus, during January and February, long U.S. dollar trades versus the pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Korean won, Russian Ruble and Mexican peso were profitable. The pound fell precipitously when the possibility of Britain s exit from the European Union (the  EU ) became more likely as Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, endorsed the move. As the quarter unfolded, however, the PBOC aggressively implemented measures to support the yuan; the G-20 Shanghai Communique in late February signaled a strong stance against currency competition that took some steam out of the U.S. dollar; and the likelihood of a near term increase in interest rates by the Fed diminished, prompting a U.S. dollar decline, especially against emerging market currencies where interest rates tend to be higher. A stabilization of commodity prices also helped the commodity producing countries. A series of events abroad further encouraged the U.S. dollar slippage: Mexico s surprise February 50 basis point hike in official interest rates; the increasing likelihood of an ouster of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil; an increase in official rates in South Africa; and rising oil prices and high interest rates supporting the Russian ruble.  Consequently, short dollar positions against the currencies of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Columbia, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey were profitable. On the other hand, long dollar trades versus the euro, yen, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, Norwegian kroner, Czech koruna, Polish zloty and Chilean peso were unprofitable.    

With the International Energy Agency suggesting that the   world could drown in [oil] oversupply   with crude oil production at or near recent record levels in many countries e.g., Saudi Arabia, Russia, the U.S., and Iraq; with Iranian exports ramping up; and with global demand still sluggish, crude prices slumped below $30 per barrel in January. Short positions in Brent crude, WTI crude, RBOB gasoline, London gas oil,  

24   

heating oil and natural gas were profitable. Subsequently, reports that Saudi Arabia, Russia and a number of other producers were discussing plans for a production freeze and would meet in Doha in April sparked an oil price rebound. Indeed, oil prices reached a three month high above  

$40 per barrel on March 18. Consequently, losses were suffered on these same short crude oil, crude products and natural gas trades, and positions were reduced and/or reversed. Overall, energy trading was fractionally profitable for the quarter due to gains from WTI crude and natural gas.    

Industrial metal prices vacillated during the quarter but did move up somewhat in synchrony with energy prices, and short positions in industrial metals were unprofitable. Safe haven demand pushed up gold prices, especially in February, and a small long trade was fractionally profitable, providing a partial offset.    

Trading of sugar was unprofitable, as was a long cocoa trade in January, and a short Arabica coffee position in March. The profits from short corn and wheat trades basically offset the losses from trading soybeans and soybean meal.     

THREE MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $3,633,451 was attributable to net income after profit share of $7,443,291 and contributions of $878,968, which were partially offset by withdrawals of $4,688,808.     

Brokerage fees are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,   contributions and withdrawals  . Brokerage fees for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased  $95,702 relative to the corresponding period in 2014.  The increase was due to an increase in average net assets of the Partnership during the three months ended September 30, 2015, relative to the corresponding period in 2014.    

The Partnership pays administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services, up to 0.25 of 1% per annum of the Partnership s average month-end net assets. Administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased $8,315 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was due mainly to an increase in the Partnership s average net assets during the three months ended September 30, 2015, relative to the corresponding period in 2014.    

Interest income is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Partnership s brokers and custodian. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased $44,842 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was due predominantly to an increase in U.S. Treasury note coupon interest during the three months ended September 30, 2015 relative to the corresponding period in 2014, and partially due to an increase in average net assets over the same period.    

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $8,506,750 from its trading operations (including foreign exchange translations and U.S. Treasury notes). Brokerage fees of $796,298, administrative expenses of $85,107, custody fees and other expenses of $6,897 and an accrued profit share to the General Partner of $253,277 were incurred. The Partnership s gains achieved from trading operations, in addition to interest income of $78,120, was partially offset by the Partnership s expenses resulting in net income after profit share to the General Partner of $7,443,291. An analysis of the trading gain (loss) by sector is as follows:

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $7,370,954 was attributable to net income after profit share of $5,603,427 and contributions of $11,098,171, which were partially offset by withdrawals of $9,330,644.  

Brokerage fees are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,   contributions and withdrawals  . Brokerage fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $253,557 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was due an increase in average net assets of the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, relative to the corresponding period in 2014.    

The Partnership pays administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services, up to 0.25 of 1% per annum of the Partnership s average month-end net assets. Administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $29,043 relative to the corresponding period in 2014.

Interest income is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Partnership s brokers and custodian. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased  $73,242 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was due predominantly to an increase in U.S Treasury note coupon interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 relative to the corresponding period in 2014  ,    and partially due to an increase in average net assets over the same period.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $8,323,271 from its trading operations (including foreign exchange translations and U.S. Treasury notes).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION    2015 

Three months ended   September 30, 2015 

At the end of a quarter of extraordinary volatility in both financial and commodity markets, the Partnership posted a gain due to profits from long interest rate futures positions, short energy and metal future positions and, long dollar foreign exchange forward positions. On the other hand, trading of stock index futures was unprofitable, as was, to a lesser extent, trading of agricultural commodity futures.  

Futile attempts by Chinese officials to stem a sharp equity selloff, two official rate cuts by the People s Bank of China (the  PBOC ), and a surprise devaluation of the Chinese yuan, coupled with weak economic data, raised questions about how China s leadership was addressing its economic slowdown. Also during the quarter, the vacillating prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate increase were answered in a somewhat surprising way in September when the Federal Reserve failed to raise official rates. The decision not to change rates, even as U.S. growth and employment data remained strong, led the markets to conclude that U.S. policymakers think the rising dollar, increased market volatility and slowing growth in emerging economies could derail global economic activity, and they did not want to exacerbate that threat with a rate increase. Actual and upcoming elections in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Argentina, Singapore, Canada and Australia, and heightened political uncertainties elsewhere Brazil, Russia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Middle East only added to investor skittishness.  

Against this background and with inflation generally subdued globally, demand for government securities, augmented by some safe haven buying, was strong. Consequently, long positions in U.S., Canadian, German, French, Italian, British and Japanese note and bond futures were profitable. Long positions in U.S. and British short-term interest rate futures were profitable also. Official rate reductions by several central banks including those of China (twice), New Zealand (twice), Canada, Taiwan, Norway, Sweden, India and Hungary added to the downward pressure on interest rates. A September comment from European Central Bank President Draghi that   more ease is possible   also supported government securities purchases.  

Lowered global growth projections from the IMF, World Bank, OECD, WTO and Asian Development Bank cemented the outlook for low energy demand amid continuing oversupply. Consequently, energy prices declined and short positions in crude oil, crude oil products, and natural gas were profitable. Th  is occurred despite an abrupt    though temporary 25% oil price spike on the final three trading days of August, amid signs that U.S. production during the first half of 2015 had fallen more than previously reported, and that OPEC might be willing to alter its current production stance. This was the largest three day gain in the price of oil in 25 years.  

Prices of industrial metals fell in the July-September period. Short positions in copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc and platinum were profitable.  Abundant supplies and inventories of metals brought on by the expansion of productive capacity over the past 10-20 years have combined with sluggish demand especially from China  and a stronger U.S. dollar to depress prices. Trading of gold and silver were marginally unprofitable.  

In the wake of the difficult economic and political situations in Asia and emerging markets, long U.S. dollar positions versus the currencies of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, and Turkey were profitable. On the other hand, as risk was unwound, the euro, which had been used as funding vehicle due to its low interest rate, advanced faster than the U.S. dollar and a long U.S. dollar position versus the euro was unprofitable. Trading the U.S. dollar against the currencies of India, Australia, the U.K., Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Poland was unprofitable. After the Federal Reserve failed to raise interest rates, the U.S. dollar fell back somewhat, earlier profits were reduced and positions were cut back.   

In this environment, investors sold equities aggressively and volatility spiked higher, especially in August and September. Long positions in Japanese, Hong Kong, Chinese and U.S. equity futures were unprofitable, and positions were reduced or reversed. Short positions in Korean and Singaporean indices, and trading of Dutch and German stock futures were profitable, reducing the sector s overall loss. In addition, these overall losses were reduced somewhat when equity prices rallied on the last day of September quarter.  

Turning to agricultural commodities, trading of corn, wheat, soybeans and soybean meal, and a long cotton position were unprofitable. On the other hand, profits from long sugar, coffee, soybean oil and cattle trades, and from a long cocoa position provided partially offsetting gains.  

Three months ended June 30, 2015    

The Partnership sustained a loss as a number of profitable, consensus trades from the first quarter proved unprofitable in the second quarter.  Long positions in interest rate futures, equity futures, and U.S. dollar forwards and short euro currency trades were unprofitable. Short energy futures trades were unprofitable as well. On the other hand, trading of metal futures was profitable, while trading of soft and agricultural commodities was nearly flat.  

The sanguine attitude towards Greece from the first quarter became a second quarter ebb and flow of meetings, proposals, information and recriminations around the Greek crisis, culminating in the imposition of capital controls; a week-long bank holiday; and a nationwide referendum that rattled equity, bond and currency markets. The U.S. economy rebounded from its poor first quarter performance, although inflation and wages did not register explicit improvements. Consequently, the on-again, off-again prospects for a Federal Reserve rate increase added to market  

27   

anxiety.  Finally, uncertainty about China s growth prospects were compounded late in the period by the sudden, precipitous collapse in Chinese equity markets. 

The prices of German, French, and Italian note and bond futures, which had risen precipitously in the wake of the European Central Bank s quantitative easing program, reversed course abruptly, driving rates sharply higher as analysts questioned the extraordinarily low levels they had reached particularly as EU economic data was improving and the Greek situation seemed to defy solution. Consequently, long positions in Continental European note and bond futures were unprofitable. Though the path was not a straight line partly due to reduced global bond market liquidity, better U.S. economic news pushed U.S. interest rates higher, producing losses from long positions in U.S. note and bond futures. Long positions in Japanese bond futures, U.K. bond futures, and short sterling futures also registered losses. Long positions in U.S. 2-year notes and short term euro-U.S. dollar futures did register small gains.  

The path of equity prices during the quarter was uneven across time and markets. Equity futures were buffeted in a positive way by improving economic data from the U.S. and Europe, and in a negative way by the unfolding Greek tragedy; by economic growth concerns and wild swings in equity markets in China that prompted a Bank of China rate cut; and by worries about the timing of possible federal funds rate increases. In the end, the negative influences carried the day. Long positions in European, British, Canadian, Australian, Korean and Taiwanese equity futures posted losses, especially in June. Meanwhile, long positions in Chinese, Hong Kong and Japanese futures remained profitable even after posting losses in May and June.  As volatility spiked in June, the gain from a short VIX position was pared back.  

Currency trading was also volatile during the quarter.  In April and early May, the poor results from the U.S. first quarter GDP report raised the likelihood that an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate increase would be delayed.  Consequently, long U.S. dollar positions registered losses and were reduced or reversed.  Later on, the U.S. dollar steadied as U.S. economic data recovered and as the situations in China and Greece deteriorated.  On balance, trading the U.S. dollar against the currencies of Australia, the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Czech Republic, Sweden, and Korea was unprofitable.  Short euro trades versus several currencies were also unprofitable.  The gain from a long U.S. dollar/short Japanese yen trade provided a partial offset.  

Energy prices moved higher in April amid signs of a growth improvement in Europe and a weakening dollar.  Consequently, short positions in crude oil, crude oil products and natural gas generated losses and were scaled back.  

Short positions in aluminum, copper, palladium, platinum, and silver were profitable, particularly in May and June, as China s slowdown and equity turmoil led to reduced demand and some increased supplies on world markets.  Increased palladium and platinum production from South Africa also weighed on prices. Meanwhile, a sharp swing in the price of zinc led to a loss on a long position, and trading of gold was also unprofitable.  

Grain prices, which have been falling rather persistently, rose somewhat late in the period as heavy rains in the U.S. threatened to delay harvests of some crops and planting of others.  Consequently, losses on short corn and wheat positions outweighed the gains from long soybean and soybean meal trades.  

The loss on a short sugar trade slightly outweighed the gains from a long cocoa position and a short coffee trade.  

Three months ended March 31, 2015       

Solid first quarter performance was led by gains from trading of financial markets interest rate and equity futures, and currency forwards.  Commodity futures trading was nearly flat as losses from trading grain futures were countered by gains from trading soft, metal and livestock futures.  

The European Central Bank s historic quantitative easing announcement, several easing moves by the People s Bank of China and more than 20 other official interest rate reductions led to sharp gains on long positions in U.S. interest rate futures across the yield curve. Long positions in German, Italian, French, Canadian and Australian notes and bonds also registered profits. A long position in short-term sterling rates was profitable as events suggested that any tightening of U.K. monetary policy would be delayed.    

The more accommodative monetary policy environment and some improvement in growth indicators for Europe led to gains on long positions in Continental European, Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Australian equity futures. On the other hand, a short Korean kospi futures trade was unprofitable.  Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures, after reaching record levels, stagnated in the wake of the stronger dollar, disappointing earnings reports, and a first quarter growth slowdown.   

Currency markets were volatile during the quarter, although a solid U.S. economic outlook, generally higher relative interest rates, and some safe haven cachet underpinned the U.S. dollar. Still, a tentative Russia/ Ukraine ceasefire and temporary bouts of sanity around the Greek crisis periodically took some steam out of the dollar. Overall, long dollar positions versus the euro, Czech koruna, Swedish krona, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, and Canadian dollar were profitable. On the other hand, a long U.S. dollar/short Swiss franc trade sustained a large loss when, on January 15  th  , the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly ended the franc s peg to the euro and the franc soared 15%. Long U.S. dollar trades against the South African, Norwegian, and New Zealand currencies produced small losses.

Grain prices recovered a bit after the USDA projected a reduction in planting acreage for the current crop year. Consequently, short wheat positions, and to a lesser extent trading of corn, soybeans, soybean meal and bean oil produced minor losses. Coffee and sugar prices continued to fall and short positions in both were profitable. A short hog trade was marginally positive.  

Energy trading was flat as the gains from short WTI crude and natural gas positions offset the losses from short Brent crude, heating oil, and London gas oil trades.  Metal trading was also nearly flat with gains from short aluminum, silver, and nickel positions and trading of gold marginally outpacing the losses from short copper, zinc, and platinum positions and trading of palladium.   

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

The Partnership does not enter into any contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments of a type that would be typical for an operating company or that would affect its liquidity or capital resources. The Partnership s sole business is trading futures, forward currency, spot, option and swap contracts, both long (contracts to buy  ) and short (contacts to sell).   All such contracts are settled by offset, not delivery. Substantially all such contracts are for settlement within four months of the trade date and substantially all such contracts are held by the Partnership for less than four months before being offset or rolled over into new contracts with similar maturities. The financial statements present a Condensed Schedule of Investments setting forth the Partnership s open futures and forward currency contracts, both long and short  , at   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not required. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The General Partner, with the participation of its principal executive officers and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the Partnership as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, and, based on its evaluation, has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in the General Partner's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the General Partner's internal controls over financial reporting with respect to the Partnership.
