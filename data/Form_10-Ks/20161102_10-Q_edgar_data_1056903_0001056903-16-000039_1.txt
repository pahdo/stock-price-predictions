  General 
    
  The basic financial statements included herein have been prepared by Registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring items and estimates necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been made. 
    
  It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto in the latest Annual Report on Form 10-K of American States Water Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Golden State Water Company. 
    
  Filing Format 
    
  American States Water Company ( AWR ) is the parent company of Golden State Water Company ( GSWC ) and American States Utility Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("ASUS"). 
    
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q is a combined report being filed by two separate Registrants: AWR and GSWC.  For more information, please see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the heading entitled "General" in "Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

  Forward-Looking Information 
    
  This Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the  safe harbor  from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and include statements regarding management s goals, beliefs, plans or current expectations, taking into account the information currently available to management.  Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts.  For example, when we use words such as  anticipate,   believe,   plan,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may  and other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes, we are making forward-looking statements.  We are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results.  We caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results may differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements.  Some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements or from historical results, include, but are not limited to:  

the outcomes of pending and future regulatory, legislative or other proceedings, investigations or audits, including decisions in GSWC's general rate cases and the results of independent audits of GSWC's construction contracting procurement practices or other independent audits of GSWC's costs; 

changes in the policies and procedures of the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC"); 

timeliness of CPUC action on rates; 

availability of GSWC's water supplies, which may be adversely affected by the California drought, changes in weather patterns in the West, contamination, and court decisions or other governmental actions restricting the use of water from the Colorado River, the California State Water Project, and/or pumping of groundwater; 

our ability to efficiently manage GSWC capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses within CPUC authorized levels, and timely recover our costs through rates; 

the impact of opposition to GSWC rate increases on our ability to recover our costs through rates, including costs associated with construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of water, new wells to replace wells that are no

longer in service (or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers), and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water; 

the impact of opposition by GSWC customers to rate increases associated with the implementation of tiered rate structures as well as restrictions on water use mandated in California as a result of the California drought, which decreases adopted usage and increases customer rates;  

the impact of condemnation actions on future GSWC revenues and other aspects of our business if we do not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired, or recovery of all charges associated with the condemnation of these assets, and the impact on future revenues if we are no longer entitled to any portion of the revenues generated from these assets;

our ability to obtain adequate, reliable and cost-effective supplies of chemicals, electricity, fuel, water and other raw materials that are needed for our water and wastewater operations; 

our ability to attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees;  

our ability to recover the costs associated with the contamination of GSWC s groundwater supplies from parties responsible for the contamination or through the ratemaking process, and the time and expense incurred by us in obtaining recovery of such costs; 

adequacy of our electric division's power supplies and the extent to which we can manage and respond to the volatility of electric and natural gas prices; 

our electric operation's ability to comply with the CPUC s renewable energy procurement requirements; 

changes in GSWC long-term customer demand due to changes in customer usage patterns as a result of conservation efforts, regulatory changes affecting demand such as mandatory restrictions on water use, new landscaping or irrigation requirements, recycling of water by customers or purchase of recycled water supplied by other parties, unanticipated population growth or decline, changes in climate conditions, general economic and financial market conditions and cost increases, which may impact our long-term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases, if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the decline in per-customer residential usage or GSWC's customer base declines as a result of condemnation actions or the use of recycled or reclaimed water from other third-party sources;

  AND 
  GOLDEN STATE WATER COMPANY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
    
  Nature of Operations  : American States Water Company ( AWR ) is the parent company of Golden State Water Company ( GSWC ) and American States Utility Services, Inc. ( ASUS ) (and its subsidiaries, Fort Bliss Water Services Company ( FBWS ), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. ( TUS ), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. ( ODUS ), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. ( PSUS ), Old North Utility Services, Inc. ( ONUS ) and Emerald Coast Utility Services, Inc. ( ECUS )).  The subsidiaries of ASUS are collectively referred to as the  Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.  
    
  GSWC is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in California serving approximately   261,000   customers.  GSWC also distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California serving approximately   24,000   customers through its Bear Valley Electric Service ( BVES ) division.  Although GSWC has a diversified base of residential, industrial and other customers, revenues derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for approximately   90%   of total water revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) regulates GSWC s water and electric businesses in matters including properties, rates, services, facilities and transactions by GSWC with its affiliates.  AWR s assets and operating income are primarily those of GSWC. 
    
  ASUS, through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various United States military bases pursuant to   50  -year firm fixed-price contracts.  These contracts are subject to periodic price redeterminations or economic price adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations and additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases.   
    
  On July 12, 2016, ASUS was awarded a   50  -year contract by the U.S. government to operate, maintain, and provide construction management services for the water and wastewater systems at Eglin Air Force Base located in Florida. The contract is subject to annual economic price adjustments.  ASUS will assume operations at Eglin Air Force Base under its ECUS subsidiary, following the completion of an   8   to   10   month transition period currently underway.  
    
  There is no direct regulatory oversight by the CPUC over AWR or the operations, rates or services provided by ASUS or any of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. 
    
  Basis of Presentation  : The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are presented in a combined report filed by   two   separate Registrants: AWR and GSWC.  References in this report to  Registrant  are to AWR and GSWC, collectively, unless otherwise specified.  
    
  AWR owns all of the outstanding Common Shares of GSWC and ASUS.  ASUS owns all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.  The consolidated financial statements of AWR include the accounts of AWR and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.  These financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the AWR consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The   December 31, 2015   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring items and estimates necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been made.  It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.

     Table of Contents  

GSWC's Related Party Transactions  : GSWC and ASUS provide and/or receive various support services to and from their parent, AWR, and among themselves.  GSWC also allocates certain corporate office administrative and general costs to its affiliate, ASUS, using allocation factors approved by the CPUC.  GSWC allocated corporate office administrative and general costs to ASUS of approximately   $984,000   and   $659,000   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $3.0 million   and   $2.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,  AWR had a   $100 million   syndicated credit facility.  In October 2016,  AWR elected to increase the aggregate commitment by an additional   $50 million   as permitted under the terms of the facility agreement. AWR can borrow up to   $150 million   under the revised facility and provide funds to its subsidiaries, GSWC and ASUS, in support of their operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $77.0 million   outstanding under this facility. The interest rate charged to GSWC and ASUS is sufficient to cover AWR s interest expense under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  In October 2015, AWR issued interest-bearing promissory notes (the "Notes") to GSWC and ASUS for   $40 million   and   $10 million  , respectively, which expire on May 23, 2018.  Under the terms of these Notes, AWR may borrow from GSWC and ASUS amounts up to   $40 million   and   $10 million  , respectively, for working capital purposes.  AWR agrees to pay any unpaid principal amounts outstanding under these notes, plus accrued interest.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   amounts outstanding under these notes.  
    
  Sales and Use Taxes  :  GSWC bills certain sales and use taxes levied by state or local governments to its customers. Included in these sales and use taxes are franchise fees, which GSWC pays to various municipalities (based on ordinances adopted by these municipalities) in order to use public rights of way for utility purposes.  GSWC bills these franchise fees to its customers based on a CPUC-authorized rate for each ratemaking area as applicable.  These franchise fees, which are required to be paid regardless of GSWC s ability to collect them from its customers, are accounted for on a gross basis.  GSWC s franchise fees billed to customers and recorded as operating revenue were approximately   $1.1 million   for each of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $3 million   for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  When GSWC acts as an agent, and a tax is not required to be remitted if it is not collected from customers, the tax is accounted for on a net basis. 
    
  Depending on the states in which their operations are conducted, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries are also subject to certain state non-income tax assessments generally computed on a  gross receipts  or  gross revenues  basis.  These non-income tax assessments are required to be paid regardless of whether the U.S. government reimburses these assessments under the   50  -year contracts.  The non-income tax assessments are accounted for on a gross basis and totaled   $62,000   and   $265,000   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $209,000   and   $351,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  :  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updated accounting guidance on revenue recognition.  The guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what the entity expects in exchange for the goods or services.  The guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and adoption is not permitted earlier than the original effective date, that is, no earlier than 2017.  The guidance allows entities to select one of two methods of adoption, either the full retrospective approach, meaning the guidance would be applied to all periods presented, or the modified retrospective approach, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the guidance would be recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018, along with providing certain additional disclosures.  Registrant will adopt this guidance in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  Management has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on the Company's ongoing financial reporting.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, rather than as an asset.  The standard does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.  This guidance was adopted January 1, 2016.  Accordingly, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Registrant had debt issuance costs, excluding credit facility costs, of   $4.4 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively, reflected in "Long-term debt."  
    On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued a new lease accounting standard,     Leases     (ASC 842).  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease).  Extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required in order to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized, and

expected to be recognized, from existing contracts.  The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Management has not yet determined the effect of the standard on the Company's ongoing financial reporting.    
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which amends ASC Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation.    Under the new guidance, the tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement (or expiration) will be required to be recorded through the income statement rather than through equity, further increasing the volatility of income tax expense.  The new standard also removes the requirement to delay recognition of a windfall tax benefit until an employer reduces its current taxes payable.  It also permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for shared-based payment awards.  The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management has not yet determined the effect of the standard on the Company's ongoing financial reporting.  
    
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on Registrant's consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

Note 2   Regulatory Matters: 
    
  In accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, Registrant records regulatory assets, which represent probable future recovery of costs from customers through the ratemaking process, and regulatory liabilities, which represent probable future refunds that are to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process.  At   September 30, 2016  , Registrant had approximately   $56.2 million   of regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, not accruing carrying costs.  Of this amount,   $23.3 million   relates to the underfunded position in Registrant's pension and other post-retirement obligations,   $5.6 million   relates to a memorandum account authorized by the CPUC to track unrealized gains and losses on BVES's purchase power contracts over the term of the contracts, and   $17.6 million   relates to deferred income taxes representing accelerated tax benefits flowed through to customers, which will be included in rates concurrently with recognition of the associated future tax expense.  The remainder relates to other items that do not provide for or incur carrying costs.  
    
  Regulatory assets represent costs incurred by GSWC for which it has received or expects to receive rate recovery in the future.  In determining the probability of costs being recognized in other periods, GSWC considers regulatory rules and decisions, past practices, and other facts or circumstances that would indicate if recovery is probable.  If the CPUC determines that a portion of GSWC s assets are not recoverable in customer rates, GSWC must determine if it has suffered an asset impairment requiring it to write down the asset's value.  Regulatory assets are offset against regulatory liabilities within each ratemaking area.  Amounts expected to be collected or refunded in the next 12 months have been classified as current assets and current liabilities by ratemaking area.  Regulatory assets, less regulatory liabilities, included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:  

Regulatory matters are discussed in detail in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.  The discussion below focuses on significant matters and developments since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Alternative-Revenue Programs: 
    
  GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC using the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism ( WRAM ) and Modified Cost Balancing Account ( MCBA ) accounts approved by  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

the CPUC.   The over- or under-collection of the WRAM is netted against the MCBA over- or under-collection for the corresponding ratemaking area and bears interest at the current   90  -day commercial paper rate.   
    
  GSWC has implemented surcharges to recover its WRAM/MCBA balances as of December 31, 2015.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , surcharges (net of surcredits) of approximately   $12.9 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, were billed to customers to recover previously incurred under-collections in the WRAM/MCBA accounts.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , GSWC recorded additional net under-collections in the WRAM/MCBA accounts of   $33.2 million   partially due to using 2015 adopted revenues since the CPUC has not approved GSWC's pending water rate case, which will set new rates for the years 2016 - 2018 as discussed below.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GSWC had a net aggregated regulatory asset of   $65.4 million   which is comprised of a $  69.8 million   under-collection in the WRAM accounts and   $4.4 million   over-collection in the MCBA accounts.  
    
  As required by the accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs, GSWC is required to collect its WRAM balances, net of its MCBA, within   24 months   following the year in which an under-collection is recorded.  The recovery periods for the majority of GSWC's WRAM/MCBA balances are primarily within   24 months  ; however, as of December 31, 2015 there were some ratemaking areas that had recovery periods related to the 2015 WRAM balances that were greater than   24 months  .  As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2015, GSWC did not record   $1.4 million   of the 2015 WRAM under-collection balance as revenue.  This amount is recognized as revenue in the periods in which it is determined that the amounts will be collected within   24 months  .  During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , GSWC recognized   $110,000   and $  800,000  , respectively, of this amount as revenue as it was determined that these amounts would be recovered within   24 months  .  In 2016, GSWC implemented CPUC-approved surcharges for recovery of the 2015 WRAM balances, including the   $1.4 million   discussed above.    
    
  Other Regulatory Matters: 
    
    Pending Water General Rate Case: 
  In 2014, GSWC filed a general rate case ( GRC ) for all of its water regions and the general office to determine new rates for the years 2016-2018.  A proposed decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Once a final decision is issued, the rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2016.  GSWC has settled with the CPUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates ("ORA") the majority of GSWC s operating expenses, as well as the consumption levels to be used to calculate rates for 2016-2018, which reflect state-mandated conservation targets that were previously in place.  The primary unresolved issues relate to GSWC s capital budget requests and compensation for managerial level employees.  At this time, GSWC cannot predict the final outcome of this GRC.  The final decision, once issued, will be retroactive to January 1, 2016 and could result in a material change to GSWC's net income recorded during the first nine months of 2016 that may need to be adjusted in the quarter that a proposed decision is issued. 
  Year-to-date 2016 billed revenues have been based on 2015 adopted rates established in the prior GRC. The adopted revenues for 2016, once the CPUC issues a final decision in the current GRC, are expected to be lower than the 2015 adopted levels due primarily to decreases in: (i) supply costs caused by lower consumption, (ii) depreciation expense resulting from an updated depreciation study, and (iii) other operating expenses.  As a result of the anticipated reduction in the 2016 adopted revenues, GSWC has adjusted its water revenues downward for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 with corresponding decreases to supply costs, depreciation expense and certain other expenses, to reflect the settled positions with ORA.  The adjustment to 2016 recorded water revenues also reflects GSWC s positions on unresolved capital budget and compensation-related issues in the pending GRC.  These adjustments did not have a significant impact on pretax operating income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as the overall reduction in water revenues is mostly offset by lower supply costs, depreciation and other operating expenses.  
  Procurement Audits: 
  In December 2011, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting a settlement between GSWC and the CPUC on its investigation of certain work orders and charges paid to a specific contractor used previously for numerous construction projects primarily in one of GSWC's three main geographic water regions.  As part of the settlement reached with the CPUC on this matter, GSWC agreed to be subject to   three   separate independent audits over a period of   ten   years from the date the settlement was approved by the CPUC.  The audits cover GSWC's policies and procedures for the procurement of outside contracts for engineering or construction for capital projects related to other contractors after 1993.  The first audit started in 2014 and covered an almost   20  -year period from January 1, 1994 through September 30, 2013.   
  In March 2015, the accounting firm engaged by the CPUC to conduct the first independent audit issued its final report to the CPUC s Division of Water and Audits ( DWA ).  The final report, which was issued on a confidential basis, included GSWC's responses to the accounting firm s findings, as well as the firm s responses to GSWC's comments.  DWA informed GSWC that it does not intend to pursue further investigation, refunds, or penalties in respect of past procurement activities as a result of the final  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

report.  Furthermore, in June 2015 ORA notified the administrative law judge in the ongoing general rate case that, having reviewed the final audit report, its potential concerns with the audit report were satisfied and, as such, ORA withdrew its request to have further review of this matter in the pending general rate case.  The CPUC is expected to address the final audit report as part of the pending water GRC.  At this time, GSWC does not believe that a loss associated with any disallowances and/or penalties from this first audit is likely. 
    Formal Complaint Filed at the CPUC: 
  In June 2016, a third party filed a formal complaint with the CPUC against GSWC in connection with a water main break that occurred in 2014.  The water main break caused damage to a commercial building.  Repairs to the building have been delayed for a variety of reasons, including a dispute and litigation between two of GSWC's insurance carriers regarding their respective coverage obligations, as well as questions as to the nature and extent of the building s damage and the costs associated therewith.  The complaint filed with the CPUC requests, among other things, that the CPUC investigate the main break, the damage to the commercial building, and the delay of its repairs, and the complaint asks the CPUC to order GSWC to immediately complete repairs.  GSWC believes it has reasonable defenses to the complaint filed with the CPUC.  In July 2016, GSWC filed an answer to the formal complaint with the CPUC as well as a motion to dismiss the complaint.  Previously, the owners of the commercial building filed suit in Ventura County Superior Court against GSWC for damages to the building.  The trial of this lawsuit is set for December 2016.  At this time, GSWC believes it has sufficient insurance coverage to cover any judgment entered in the civil suit pending in Superior Court.  However, GSWC cannot predict the outcome of the Superior Court litigation, the dispute and litigation between its insurers, or the CPUC proceeding.  

Note 3   Earnings per Share/Capital Stock: 
    
  In accordance with the accounting guidance for participating securities and earnings per share ( EPS ), Registrant uses the  two-class  method of computing EPS.  The  two-class  method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security.  AWR has participating securities related to restricted stock units that earn dividend equivalents on an equal basis with AWR s Common Shares that have been issued under AWR's 2000 and 2008 Stock Incentive Plans and the 2003 and 2013 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plans.  In applying the  two-class  method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities. 
  The following is a reconciliation of Registrant s net income and weighted average Common Shares outstanding used for calculating basic net income per share: 

Diluted EPS is based upon net income and the weighted average number of Common Shares, including both outstanding shares and shares potentially issuable in connection with stock options and restricted stock units granted under AWR s 2000 and 2008 Stock Incentive Plans, and the 2003 and 2013 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plans.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   138,060   and   174,306   options outstanding, respectively, under these Plans.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were also   216,733   and   211,406   restricted stock units outstanding, respectively, including performance shares awarded to officers of the Registrant.

The following is a reconciliation of Registrant s net income and weighted average Common Shares outstanding for calculating diluted net income per share:   

(1)      In applying the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding stock-based compensation in the calculation of diluted EPS,   138,060   and   174,306   stock options at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were deemed to be outstanding in accordance with accounting guidance on earnings per share.  All of the   216,733   and   211,406   restricted stock units at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  No   stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   had an exercise price greater than the average market price of AWR s Common Shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   2015   that were anti-dilutive. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , AWR issued   67,832   and   96,157   Common Shares, for approximately $  210,000   and $  746,000  , respectively, under Registrant s Common Share Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, the 401(k) Plan, the 2000 and 2008 Stock Incentive Plans and the 2003 and 2013 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plans.  
    
  In 2014 and 2015, AWR's Board of Directors approved stock repurchase programs, authorizing AWR to repurchase up to   2.45 million   shares of its Common Shares from time to time through June 30, 2017.  Both programs were completed during 2015.  Under these programs, Registrant repurchased   1.7 million   shares during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015.  The repurchase of Common Shares is restricted by California law under the same standards which apply to dividend distributions. 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , AWR paid quarterly dividends of approximately   $8.2 million  , or   $0.224   per share, and   $8.3 million  , or   $0.224   per share, respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , AWR paid quarterly dividends to shareholders of approximately   $24.6 million  , or   $0.672   per share, and   $24.5 million  , or   $0.65   per share, respectively.  

Note 4   Derivative Instruments: 
    
  Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to commodity price risk.  Commodity price risk represents the potential impact that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commodity.  BVES purchases power under long-term contracts at a fixed cost depending on the amount of power and the period during which the power is purchased under such contracts.  In December 2014, BVES entered into several CPUC-approved long-term purchased power contracts with energy providers.  BVES began taking power under these long-term contracts effective January 1, 2015 at a fixed cost over   three  - and   five  -year terms depending on the amount of power and the period during which the power is purchased under the contracts.    
  The long-term contracts executed in December 2014 are subject to the accounting guidance for derivatives and require mark-to-market derivative accounting.  Among other things, the CPUC also authorized GSWC to establish a regulatory asset and liability memorandum account to offset the mark-to-market entries required by the accounting guidance.  Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses generated from the purchased power contracts executed in December 2014 are deferred on a monthly basis into a non-interest bearing regulatory memorandum account that tracks the changes in fair value of the derivatives throughout the terms of the contracts.  As a result, these unrealized gains and losses do not impact GSWC s earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a   $5.6 million   unrealized loss in the memorandum account for the purchased power contracts as a  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

result of the drop in energy prices.  The notional volume of derivatives remaining under these long-term contracts as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   396,000   megawatt hours.   
  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis.  Under the accounting guidance, GSWC makes fair value measurements that are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
    
  Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
    
  Level 2  : Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or 
    
  Level 3  : Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). 
    
  To value the contracts, Registrant applies the Black-76 model, utilizing various inputs that include quoted market prices for energy over the duration of the contracts.  The market prices used to determine the fair value for these derivative instruments may be estimated based on independent sources such as broker quotes and publications that are not observable in or corroborated by the market.  Registrant received   one   broker quote to determine the fair value of its derivative instruments.  When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instruments are categorized as Level 3.  Accordingly, the valuation of the derivatives on Registrant s purchased power contract has been classified as Level 3 for all periods presented. 
   The following table presents changes in the fair value of GSWC s Level 3 derivatives for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Note 5   Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
    
  For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the amounts.   
    
  Investments held in a Rabbi Trust for the supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") are measured at fair value and totaled   $12.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  All equity investments in the Rabbi Trust are Level 1 investments in mutual funds.  The investments held in the Rabbi Trust are included in Other Property and Investments on Registrant's balance sheets.  
    
  The table below estimates the fair value of long-term debt held by GSWC.  The fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were determined using rates for similar financial instruments of the same duration utilizing Level 2 methods and assumptions.  The interest rates used for the   September 30, 2016   valuation decreased as compared to   December 31, 2015  , increasing the fair value of long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016  .  Changes in the assumptions will produce different results.

Note 6   Income Taxes: 
  As a regulated utility, GSWC treats certain temporary differences as flow-through adjustments in computing its income tax provision consistent with the income tax approach approved by the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.  Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period.  Giving effect to these temporary differences as flow-through adjustments typically results in a greater variance between the effective tax rate ( ETR ) and the statutory federal income tax rate in any given period than would otherwise exist if GSWC were not required to account for its income taxes as a regulated enterprise.  GSWC's ETR was   38.2%   and   42.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   38.3%   and   41.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The GSWC ETRs deviated from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow-through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily plant-, rate-case- and compensation-related items).  The ETR at the AWR consolidated level may also fluctuate as a result of certain permanent differences as well as state taxes recorded at AWR (parent) and at ASUS and the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries (where the amounts of state taxes vary among the jurisdictions in which they operate).  
     Changes in Tax Law  : 
  In December 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended bonus depreciation for qualifying property through 2019.  For 2015 through 2017, bonus depreciation was extended at a 50% rate.  For 2018-2019, bonus depreciation will be phased down to 40% and 30%, respectively.  Although the change in law reduces Registrant s current taxes payable over these years, it does not reduce its total income tax expense or ETR.

Note 7   Employee Benefit Plans: 
       The components of net periodic benefit costs, before allocation to the overhead pool, for Registrant s pension plan, postretirement plan and SERP for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:   

During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Registrant contributed   $5.3 million   to its pension plan.  
  Regulatory Adjustment  : 
  As authorized by the CPUC in the most recent water and electric general rate case decisions, GSWC utilizes two-way balancing accounts for its water and electric regions and the general office to track differences between the forecasted annual pension expenses in rates or expected to be in rates and the actual annual expense recorded by GSWC in accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GSWC had a total   $1.5 million   net under-collection in the two-way pension balancing accounts included as part of the pension regulatory asset (Note 2).   
   
  Note 8   Contingencies: 
    
  Condemnation of Properties  : 
    
  The laws of the State of California provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, also known as condemnation, where doing so is necessary and in the public interest.  In addition, these laws provide that the owner of utility property (i) may contest whether the condemnation is actually necessary and in the public interest, and (ii) is entitled to receive the fair market value of its property if it is ultimately taken. 
  Claremont System:

     Table of Contents  

In December 2014, the City of Claremont, California filed a complaint in eminent domain against GSWC.  GSWC is in the process of vigorously defending against the eminent domain action.  Closing arguments for the phase of the trial determining Claremont's right to seize the system by eminent domain concluded in August 2016, with a decision expected within   90   days after the closing arguments.  At this time, management cannot predict the outcome of this eminent domain proceeding.  The Claremont water system has a net book value of approximately   $49.3 million  .  GSWC serves approximately   11,000   customers in Claremont.  
    Ojai System: 
  In March 2013, Casitas Municipal Water District ("CMWD") passed resolutions under the Mello-Roos Communities Facilities District Act of 1982 ("Mello-Roos Act") authorizing the establishment of a Community Facilities District, and the issuance of bonds to finance the potential acquisition of GSWC s Ojai, California system through eminent domain.  In January 2014, a group of citizens referred to as "Friends of Locally Owned Water" ("FLOW") were granted class status to allow them to later file a complaint against GSWC for damages related to any potential delay in the eminent domain proceedings caused by GSWC s challenge of CMWD s use of Mello-Roos funds for such a taking of property. 
    
  On May 12, 2016, CMWD filed a complaint in eminent domain against GSWC.  The complaint also included additional causes of action related to claims of potential damages resulting from any delay caused by GSWC seeking relief in the prior action regarding the use of Mello-Roos funds for such a taking of property.  On June 28, 2016, FLOW filed for 
  intervention as a plaintiff to also seek potential damages resulting from the additional causes of actions listed above as facilitated in their earlier filing to be granted class status.  On October 25, 2016, the Court struck FLOW s complaint in intervention and their claims for damages.  At this time, management cannot predict whether FLOW will appeal the Court s ruling, and cannot predict the outcome of this eminent domain proceeding.  The Ojai water system has a net book value of approximately   $22.4 million  . GSWC serves approximately   3,000   customers in Ojai. 
    
  Environmental Clean-Up and Remediation  : 
       GSWC has been involved in environmental remediation and clean-up at a plant site that contained an underground storage tank which was used to store gasoline for its vehicles.  This tank was removed from the ground in July 1990 along with the dispenser and ancillary piping.  Since then, GSWC has been involved in various remediation activities at this site.   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the total amount spent to clean-up and remediate GSWC s plant facility was approximately $  5.1 million  , of which $  1.5 million   has been paid by the State of California Underground Storage Tank Fund.  Amounts paid by GSWC have been included in rate base and approved by the CPUC for recovery.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GSWC has a regulatory asset and an accrued liability for the estimated additional cost of $  1.4 million   to complete the clean-up at the site.  The estimate includes costs for two years of continued activities of cleanup and monitoring, and site-closure-related activities.  The ultimate cost may vary as there are many unknowns in remediation of underground gasoline spills and this is an estimate based on currently available information.  Management believes it is probable that the estimated additional costs will be approved in rate base by the CPUC. 
    
  Other Litigation  : 
    
  Registrant is also subject to other ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.  Management believes that rate recovery, proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to insure against property, general liability and workers  compensation claims incurred in the ordinary course of business.  Registrant is unable to predict an estimate of the loss, if any, resulting from any pending suits or administrative proceedings.

Note 9   Business Segments: 
    
  AWR has   three   reportable segments, water, electric and contracted services, whereas GSWC has   two   segments, water and electric.  On a stand-alone basis, AWR has no material assets other than its investments in its subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis.   
    
  All activities of GSWC, a rate-regulated utility, are geographically located within California.  Activities of ASUS and the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries are conducted in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.  Each of ASUS s wholly owned subsidiaries is, or is expected to be, regulated by the state in which the subsidiary primarily conducts water and/or wastewater operations.  Fees charged for operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services are based upon the terms of the contracts with the U.S. government which have been or will be filed, as appropriate, with the commissions in the states in which ASUS s Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries are incorporated. 
    
  The tables below set forth information relating to GSWC s operating segments, ASUS and the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries and other matters.  Total assets by segment are not presented below, as certain of Registrant s assets are not tracked by segment.  The utility plant amounts are net of respective accumulated provisions for depreciation.  Capital additions reflect capital expenditures paid in cash, and exclude U.S. government- and third-party contractor-funded capital expenditures for ASUS and property installed by developers and conveyed to GSWC.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 
    
  The following discussion and analysis provides information on AWR s consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR s individual segments and/or its subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries of ASUS are also collectively referred to as the "Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries." 
    
  Included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric gross margins.  Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues.  Registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results.  Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the performance of GSWC.  The discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present Registrant s operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment, which is each business segment's net income divided by AWR's weighted average number of diluted shares.  Registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of our different services.  Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget.  However, these measures, which are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share, which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  A reconciliation of water and electric gross margins to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the table under the section titled    Operating Expenses: Supply Costs.     Reconciliations to AWR s diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled    Summary of Third Quarter Results by Segment    and    Summary of Year-to-Date Results by Segment     .    

Overview 
    
  GSWC's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses in California and the delivery of electricity in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County, California.  Rates charged to GSWC customers are determined by the CPUC.  These rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital.  Factors affecting the financial performance of GSWC are described under   Forward-Looking Information   and include: the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers; the ability to recover, and the process for recovering in rates, the costs of distributing water and electricity and related overhead costs; pressures on water supply caused by the drought in California, changing weather patterns in the West, population growth, more stringent water quality standards and deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes; fines, penalties and disallowances by the CPUC arising from failures to comply with regulatory requirements; the impact of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures; changes in long-term customer demand due to changes in usage patterns as a result of conservation efforts, mandatory regulatory changes impacting the use of water, such as mandatory restrictions on water use, new landscaping or irrigation requirements, recycling of water by customers and purchases of recycled water by customers from other third parties; capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems; increased costs and risks associated with litigation related to water quality and water supply, including suits initiated by GSWC to protect its water supply and condemnation actions initiated by municipalities; fines, penalties and liabilities arising from failure to comply with health and safety standards and other liabilities related to hazards associated with electricity and chemicals used in our business; increasing costs of obtaining and complying with the terms of our franchise agreements; the impact of the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters on our operating results and financial condition; adverse impacts on our business if we are unable to attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees; the increased risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks which could disrupt our business operations and increase our expenses; market conditions and demographic changes which may adversely impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities; the impact of increasing maintenance expenses on our liquidity and earnings; and increased costs of and/or difficulties in obtaining insurance protecting BVES from wildfires in its service territory.  GSWC plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the CPUC to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital.  Capital expenditures in future years at GSWC are expected to remain at higher levels than depreciation expense.  When necessary, GSWC obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. 
    
  ASUS's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned by providing water and/or wastewater services, including the operation and maintenance services and construction of facilities at the water and/or wastewater systems at various military installations, pursuant to 50-year firm fixed-price contracts.  The contract price for each of these contracts is subject to prospective price redeterminations or economic price adjustments.  Additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications with the U.S. government or agreements with other third-party prime contractors.  As a result, ASUS is subject to risks that are different than those of GSWC.  Factors affecting the financial performance of our Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries are described under   Forward-Looking Information   and include delays in receiving payments from, and the redetermination and economic price or equitable adjustment of prices under,  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

contracts with the U.S. government; fines, penalties or disallowance of costs by the U.S. government; and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment for a period of time from contracting with the government due to violations of federal statutes and regulations in connection with military utility privatization activities.  ASUS's financial performance is also dependent upon its ability to accurately estimate costs (i) in bidding on firm fixed-price contracts for additional construction work at existing bases and (ii) under new contracts for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and/or wastewater services at military bases.  ASUS is actively pursuing utility privatization contracts of other military bases to expand the contracted services segment. 
    
  New Privatization Contract Award 
       
  On July 12, 2016, ASUS was awarded a 50-year contract by the U.S. government to operate, maintain, and provide construction services for the water and wastewater systems at Eglin Air Force Base located in Florida.  The initial value of the contract is estimated at approximately $510 million over the 50-year period and is subject to annual economic price adjustments.  ASUS will assume operations at Eglin Air Force Base following the completion of an 8 to 10 month transition period currently underway.  
    
  Pending Water General Rate Case 
  In 2014, GSWC filed a general rate case ( GRC ) for all of its water regions and the general office to determine new rates for the years 2016-2018.   A proposed decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.  GSWC has settled with the CPUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates ("ORA") the majority of GSWC s operating expenses, as well as the consumption levels to be used to calculate rates for 2016-2018, which reflect state-mandated conservation targets that were previously in place.  The primary unresolved issues relate to GSWC s capital budget requests and compensation for managerial level employees.  At this time, GSWC cannot predict the final outcome of this GRC.  The final decision, once issued, will be retroactive to January 1, 2016 and could result in a material change to GSWC's net income recorded during the first nine months of 2016 that may need to be adjusted in the quarter that a proposed decision is issued. 
  Year-to-date 2016 billed revenues have been based on 2015 adopted rates established in the prior GRC.  The adopted revenues for 2016, once the CPUC issues a final decision in this GRC, are expected to be lower than the 2015 adopted levels due primarily to decreases in: (i) supply costs caused by lower consumption, (ii) depreciation expense resulting from an updated depreciation study, and (iii) other operating expenses.  As a result of the anticipated reduction in the 2016 adopted revenues, GSWC has adjusted its water revenues downward for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 with corresponding decreases to supply costs, depreciation expense and certain other expenses, to reflect the settled positions with ORA.  The adjustment to 2016 recorded water revenues also reflects GSWC s positions on unresolved capital budget and compensation-related issues in the pending GRC.  These adjustments did not have a significant impact on pretax operating income for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as the overall reduction in the water gross margin is mostly offset by the lower depreciation and other operating expenses.  
    
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  In 2014 and 2015, AWR's Board of Directors approved two stock repurchase programs, authorizing AWR to repurchase up to 2.45 million shares of AWR's Common Shares.  Both stock repurchase programs were completed in 2015.  The repurchase programs were intended to enable AWR to achieve a consolidated shareholders  equity ratio (as a percentage of total capitalization) that is more reflective of the current CPUC-authorized equity ratio for GSWC and an equity ratio for ASUS that is more consistent with firms in the government contracting industry.  As a result, AWR repurchased 575,000 and 1.7 million shares of its stock during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These repurchases reduced the weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which positively benefited earnings per share for both periods.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the equity ratio as a percent of total capitalization was 55%.

Summary of   Third   Quarter Results by Segment 
    
  The table below sets forth the   third   quarter diluted earnings per share by business segment: 

Water Segment: 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the water segment increased by   $0.04   per share to   $0.47   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Adjustments were recorded to reduce water revenues for related reductions in supply costs, depreciation expense and certain other expenses as a result of the resolution of certain issues in the pending water rate case.  These adjustments did not have a significant impact on overall pretax operating income for     the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Therefore, the increase in water earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was due primarily to: (i) an increase in the water margin due to higher revenues from customers that do not have conservation rates as a result of increased water consumption compared to the same period in   2015  , as well as new revenues generated from a water system acquired in October 2015, (ii) an increase in interest and other income during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due primarily to higher gains on investments held for a retirement benefit plan, and (iii) a decrease in the effective income tax rate due to differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow-through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements.  
  Billed water consumption for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased by approximately 12% as compared to the same period in   2015  .  In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism ("WRAM") accounts in place at all three water regions.  The WRAM only applies to customer classes with conservation rates in place.  The majority of GSWC's water customers have conservation rate structures; however, a small percentage of GSWC's customers are not subject to conservation rates and changes in consumption will impact recorded revenues. 
  Electric Segment: 
  For     the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the electric segment increased by   $0.01   per share as compared to the same period in   2015  .    T  he electric gross margin was slightly higher for the quarter due to CPUC-approved fourth-year rate increases effective January 1, 2016, and rate increases generated from advice letter filings approved by the CPUC during 2016 and 2015.  There was also an overall decrease in operating expenses due to lower spending associated with a solar-initiative program approved by the CPUC as compared to the third quarter of   2015  .    
  Contracted Services Segment: 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the contracted services segment were   $0.10   per share as compared to   $0.12   per share for the same period in   2015  . During the third quarter of 2015 there was $3.5 million, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, in retroactive management fee revenues recorded resulting from the successful resolution of price redeterminations during the third quarter of 2015, with no material retroactive revenues recorded during the third quarter of 2016.  There was also an increase in the allocation of administrative and general expenses from GSWC to the contracted services segment as stipulated in the pending water GRC, and an increase in outside services costs. These decreases to pretax operating income were partially offset by an overall increase in construction activity and improved cost efficiencies.

Summary of Year-to-Date Results by Segment 
  The table below sets forth the year-to-date diluted earnings per share by business segment:   

Water Segment: 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the water segment increased by   $0.04   per share to   $1.04   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Adjustments were recorded to reduce water revenues for related reductions in supply costs, depreciation expense and certain other expenses as a result of the resolution of certain issues in the pending water rate case.  These adjustments did not have a significant impact on pretax operating income for     the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Favorably impacting earnings per share at the water segment were: (i) a higher water margin resulting from the recognition of a portion of the 2015 WRAM revenues that had previously been deferred, as well as new revenues generated from a water system acquired in October 2015, (ii) the cumulative impact of the lower Common Shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of stock pursuant to the stock repurchase programs, and (iii) a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the water segment due to differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow-through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements.  These increases to the water segment's diluted earnings per share were partially offset by increases in: (i) administrative and general expenses resulting from higher legal and outside services costs related to condemnation matters, and (ii) other operation expenses related to water treatment activities.  
  Electric Segment: 
  For     the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the electric segment increased   $0.01   per share to   $0.06   as compared to the same period in   2015  . There was an increase in the electric gross margin resulting from CPUC approval of fourth-year rate increases effective January 1, 2016, as well as CPUC-approved rate increases generated from advice letter filings approved in 2015 and 2016.  This increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses (other than supply costs) due primarily to an increase in: (i) other operation expenses resulting from additional costs incurred in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016 and higher wages, and (ii) depreciation expense resulting from additions to utility plant. 
  Contracted Services Segment: 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings from the contracted services segment were   $0.20   per share as compared to   $0.22   per share for the same period in   2015  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, ASUS recorded $3.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in retroactive management fee revenues as a result of successful resolution of price redeterminations during the third quarter of 2015, with no similar retroactive revenues recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There was also an increase in the allocation of administrative and general expenses from GSWC to the contracted services segment as stipulated in the pending water GRC, an increase in labor and outside services costs, and a higher effective income tax rate resulting primarily from an increase in state income taxes as compared to the same period in 2015.  State income taxes vary among the jurisdictions in which the contracted services business operates. These decreases to pretax operating income were partially offset by an overall increase in construction activity and improved cost efficiencies.

Operating Revenues: 
    
  General 
  Registrant relies upon approvals by the CPUC of rate increases to recover operating expenses and to provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant for GSWC.  Registrant relies on price redeterminations and economic price and equitable adjustments by the U.S. government in order to recover operating expenses and provide a profit margin for ASUS.  If adequate rate relief or price redeterminations and adjustments are not granted in a timely manner, current operating revenues and earnings may be negatively impacted.  ASUS s earnings are also impacted by the level of additional construction projects at the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, which may or may not continue at current levels in future periods. 
    
  Water 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from water operations decreased   $6.7 million   to   $90.6 million   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Year-to-date 2016 billed water revenues have been based on 2015 adopted rates established in the 2013-2015 GRC, adjusted for the lower revenue requirement stipulated in the pending water GRC that will establish new rates for 2016-2018.   This adjustment resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately $7.8 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. T  his decrease in water revenues was partially offset by (i) an increase in revenues from water customers that do not have conservation rates as a result from an increase in consumption compared to same period in   2015  , (ii) the recognition of a portion of the 2015 WRAM revenue that had previously been deferred, and (iii) new water revenues generated from the Rural Water Company acquisition.    The net decrease in revenues was mostly offset by corresponding decreases in operating expenses (primarily supply costs and depreciation expense).    
    
  Billed water consumption for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased by approximately 12% as compared to the same period in   2015  .  In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place at all three water regions.  However, under the accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs such as the WRAM, significant decreases in consumption may impact the timing of when revenues are recorded.  GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.  The WRAM only applies to customer classes with conservation rates in place.  The majority of GSWC's water customers have conservation rate structures; however, a small percentage of GSWC's customers are not subject to conservation rates and changes in consumption will impact recorded revenues. 
    
  Electric 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from electric operations were   $8.1 million   as compared to   $7.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase was due to CPUC-approved fourth-year rate increases effective January 1, 2016, and rate increases generated from advice letter filings approved by the CPUC during 2016 and 2015.  This was partially offset by the termination in August 2015 of a supply cost surcharge to recover previously incurred energy costs.  The decrease in revenues from the termination of the supply cost surcharge of approximately $239,000 had no impact on pretax operating income due to an offsetting decrease in supply costs.    
    
  Billed electric usage decreased 1.4% during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Due to the CPUC approved Base Revenue Requirement Adjustment Mechanism, which adjusts certain revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in electric usage do not have a significant impact on earnings. 
    
  Contracted Services 
  Revenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from contracted services were   $25.0 million   as compared to   $27.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was due, in large part, to $3.5 million in retroactive O M management fee revenues recorded during the third quarter of 2015 resulting from the successful resolution of price redeterminations during the third quarter of 2015, with no material retroactive revenues recorded during the third quarter of 2016.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in construction activity.  
    
  ASUS subsidiaries continue to enter into U.S. government-awarded contract modifications and agreements with third-party prime contractors for new construction projects at the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the U.S. government awarded ASUS approximately $21 million in new construction projects, the majority of which are expected to be completed during 2017.  Earnings and cash flows from modifications to the original 50-

year contracts with the U.S. government and agreements with third-party prime contractors for additional construction projects may or may not continue in future periods.   
  Operating Expenses: 
    
  Supply Costs 
  Supply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water, purchased power for pumping, groundwater production assessments and water supply cost balancing accounts.  Supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale, the cost of natural gas used by BVES s generating unit, the cost of renewable energy credits and the electric supply cost balancing account  .    Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues.  Registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results.  Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments.  Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget.  However, these measures, which are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, which is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
    
  Total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses.  Supply costs accounted for approximately   30.0%   and   34.2%   of total operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The table below provides the amount of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margin during the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

(1)           As reported on AWR s Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply cost balancing accounts.  The sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR s Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled   $(4,213,000)   and   $4,824,000   for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Revenues include surcharges, which increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts, thus having no net earnings impact.  
  (2)          Water and electric gross margins do not include any depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property or other taxes or other operation expenses. 
    
  Two of the principal factors affecting water supply costs are the amount of water produced and the source of the water. Generally, the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers. Under the MCBA, GSWC tracks adopted and actual expense levels for purchased water, power purchased for pumping and  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

pump taxes, as established by the CPUC.  GSWC records the variances (which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume) between adopted and actual purchased water, purchased power and pump tax expenses.  GSWC recovers from or refunds to customers the amount of such variances.  GSWC tracks these variances individually for each water ratemaking area. 
   The overall actual percentages of purchased water for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   were 41% and 44%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentage of approximately 38% for both years.  However, purchased water costs for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   increased to   $19.6 million   as compared to   $18.1 million   for the same period in   2015   due to an increase in wholesale water costs as well as a higher volume of water purchased during the same period as a result of increased water consumption. 
   For the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , the cost of power purchased for pumping was approximately   $3.0 million  .  Groundwater production assessments increased   $1.3 million   due to higher pump tax rates as well as higher customer usage during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  The water supply cost balancing account decreased   $8.8 million   during the three months ended   September 30,     2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mainly due to a reduction in supply costs stipulated within the pending water general rate case as compared to the 2015 adopted water supply cost, as well an increase in wholesale water costs and pump tax rates.    The lower supply costs have been reflected in the water revenue requirement, as previously discussed.    
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers increased to   $2.4 million  , as compared to   $2.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30,     2015  , due to an increase in the average price per megawatt-hour ( MWh ).  The average price per MWh, including fixed costs, increased from $66.42 for the three months ended   September 30,     2015   to $69.87 for the same period in   2016  .  The electric supply cost balancing account included in total supply costs decreased by   $259,000   due to the termination of a supply cost surcharge to recover previously incurred costs, as well as the increase in the average price per MWh.  
     Other Operation 
  The primary components of other operation expenses for GSWC include payroll, materials and supplies, chemicals and water treatment costs and outside service costs of operating the regulated water systems, including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution, pumping, water quality, meter reading, billing and operations of district offices.  Registrant s contracted services operations incur many of the same types of expenses as well.  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):   

       For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , other operation expenses for the water segment increased by   $417,000   primarily as a result of an increase in conservation-related costs as well as water treatment activities.

  Administrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions, employee-related benefits, insurance expenses, outside legal and consulting fees, regulatory utility commission expenses, expenses associated with being a public company and general corporate expenses charged to expense accounts.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):  

For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , administrative and general expenses for the water segment increased   $418,000   due, in large part, to higher legal and outside services costs related to condemnation activities.  This increase was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in pension-related costs, (ii) a lower allocation of administrative and general expenses to the water segment from the general office as stipulated in the pending water GRC, and (iii) decreases in vehicle expenses and insurance-related costs as compared to the same period in 2015.  The reduction in pension-related costs, vehicle expenses and the lower allocation from the general office have been reflected with a corresponding reduction in the water revenue requirement.  Legal and outside services costs tend to fluctuate and are expected to continue to fluctuate. 
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , administrative and general expenses for the electric segment decreased by   $275,000   primarily due to lower spending associated with a solar-initiative program approved by the CPUC.    
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by   $347,000   as compared to the three months ended   September 30,   2015 due to: (i) an increase in the allocation of administrative and general expenses from GSWC to the contracted services segment as stipulated in the pending water GRC, and (ii) increases in labor costs charged to administrative activities versus other operations and maintenance activities.  
    Depreciation and Amortization 
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization by business segment consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 

For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , depreciation and amortization expense for water services decreased by   $1.0 million   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to lower composite depreciation rates stipulated in the pending water GRC resulting from an updated depreciation study.    These lower composite rates will be used in the rate cycle for the years 2016 through 2018. The decrease resulting from the lower composite rates was partially offset by depreciation from additions to utility plant.      The lower net depreciation expense has been reflected in the water revenue requirement.

Maintenance expense for the water and electric segments decreased due to a lower level of planned and unplanned maintenance performed during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Different factors contribute to the timing of when maintenance activity occurs.  
  Property and Other Taxes 
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , property and other taxes by business segment consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Property and other taxes for the water segment increased during the three months ended   September 30,     2016   primarily due to capital additions and the associated increase in assessed property values.  This increase was offset by lower gross receipts taxes for contracted services related to retroactive revenues recorded during the third quarter of 2015, with no similar retroactive revenues recorded during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  ASUS Construction 
  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , construction expenses for contracted services were   $13.7 million  , decreasing   $1.2 million   compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to improved efficiency in capital program management.

  For the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , income tax expense by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Consolidated income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   decreased by   $1.7 million   due to a decrease in pretax income as well as an overall lower effective income tax rate ("ETR").  AWR's consolidated ETR was   37.0%   for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   as compared to   40.6%   for the three months ended   September 30,     2015  .  The consolidated ETR decreased as a result of changes in the ETR at GSWC, which was   38.2%   for the three months ended

September 30,     2016   as compared to   42.7%   applicable to the three months ended   September 30,     2015  .  The decrease in GSWC's ETR was due primarily to differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow-through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily related to plant, rate-case and compensation items).  Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase in another period.  The decrease in income tax expense for contracted services was due to a decrease in pretax income as well as a lower ETR compared to the three months ended   September 30,     2015   resulting primarily from state taxes, which vary among the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Operating Revenues: 
    
  Water 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from water operations decreased   $18.4 million   to   $238.0 million   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Year-to-date 2016 billed water revenues have been based on 2015 adopted rates established in the 2013-2015 GRC, adjusted for the lower revenue requirement stipulated within the pending water GRC that will establish new rates for 2016-2018.    This resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately $20.6 million as compared to the first nine months of 2015.  T  his decrease in water revenues was partially offset by the recognition of a portion of the 2015 WRAM revenue that had previously been deferred and new water revenues generated from the Rural Water Company acquisition completed in October 2015.   The net decrease in revenues from the lower revenue requirement was mostly offset by corresponding decreases in operating expenses (primarily supply costs and depreciation expense).    
    
  Billed water consumption for the first   nine   months of   2016   was similar to consumption experienced during the same period in   2015  .  Changes in consumption generally do not have a significant impact on revenues due to the WRAM.  The WRAM only applies to customer classes with conservation rates in place.  The majority of GSWC's water customers have conservation rate structures; however, a small percentage of GSWC's customers are not subject to conservation rates and changes in consumption will impact recorded revenues. 
    
  Electric 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from electric operations were   $26.4 million   as compared to   $26.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to the termination in August 2015 of a supply cost surcharge to recover previously incurred energy costs.    T  his decrease in electric revenue was partially offset by the CPUC-approved fourth-year rate increases effective January 1, 2016, and rate increases generated from advice letter filings approved by the CPUC during 2016 and 2015. The decrease in revenues from the termination of the supply cost surcharge of approximately $1.4 million had no impact on pretax operating income due to an offsetting decrease in supply costs.   
    
  Billed electric usage decreased by approximately 3% during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Due to the CPUC approved Base Revenue Requirement Adjustment Mechanism, which adjusts certain revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings. 
    
  Contracted Services 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues from contracted services were   $64.9 million   as compared to   $65.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was due to $3.0 million in retroactive O M management fee revenues recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   resulting from the successful resolution of price redeterminations during 2015, with no similar retroactive revenues recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in construction activity during the period, primarily new capital upgrade projects at Fort Bliss.

Operating Expenses: 
    
  Supply Costs 
  Total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses.  Supply costs accounted for approximately   27.3%   and   31.9%   of total operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The table below provides the amount of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margin during the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands):

(1)      As reported on AWR s Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply cost balancing accounts.  The sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR s Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled   $(10,145,000)   and   $8,453,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Revenues include surcharges, which increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts, thus having no net earnings impact.  
    
  (2)      Water and electric gross margins do not include any depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property or other taxes or other operation expenses. 
    
   The overall actual percentages of purchased water for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   were 41% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentage of approximately 36% for both years.  The higher actual percentages of purchased water resulted primarily from several wells being out of service.  As a result, purchased water costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   increased to   $49.3 million   as compared to   $46.8 million   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to the increase in purchased water in the supply mix as a result of wells being out of service, and an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2015.  
   For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased to   $6.8 million   as compared to   $7.1 million   for the same period in 2015 primarily due to decreases in pumped water resulting from the increase in purchased water.  Groundwater production assessments increased   $493,000   due to higher pump tax rates as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  The water supply cost balancing account decreased   $17.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mainly due to a reduction in supply costs as stipulated within the pending water general rate case as compared to the 2015 adopted water supply costs.     The lower supply costs have been reflected in the water revenue requirement, as previously discussed.

For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , the cost of power purchased for resale increased slightly due to an increase in the weighted average price per MWh.  The electric supply cost balancing account included in total supply costs decreased by   $1.5 million   due primarily to the termination of a supply cost surcharge to recover previously incurred costs as well as the increase in weighted average price per MWh.  
     Other Operation 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):   

   For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , total other operation expenses for the water segment increased by   $322,000   due to an increase in water treatment activities as well as labor costs resulting from higher wages.  These costs were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and conservation and drought-related costs as compared to the same period in 2015.  GSWC has been authorized by the CPUC to track incremental drought-related costs incurred in a memorandum account for possible future recovery.  During the second quarter of 2016, GSWC filed for recovery of drought-related costs of approximately $1.0 million, which had been previously incurred, mostly in 2015.  Incremental drought-related costs are being expensed until recovery is approved by the CPUC. 
  Other operation costs at the electric segment increased due to outside services costs incurred in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016.  
  Administrative and General 
    For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):    

   For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , administrative and general expenses at the water segment increased   $1.1 million   due, in large part, to higher legal and outside services costs related to condemnation activities.  This increase was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in pension-related costs, (ii) a lower allocation of administrative and general expenses to the water segment from the general office as stipulated in the pending water GRC, and (iii) decreases in other outside services costs, vehicle expenses and insurance-related costs as compared to the same period in 2015.  The reduction in pension -related costs, vehicle expenses and the lower allocation from the general office have been reflected with a corresponding reduction in the water revenue requirement.  Legal and outside services costs tend to fluctuate between periods.   
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by   $1.5 million   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due, in large part, to an increase in the allocation of administrative and general expenses from GSWC to the contracted services segment as stipulated in the pending water GRC.  In addition, there was an increase in labor and outside services costs.  Outside services costs tend to fluctuate and are expected to continue to fluctuate.

  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization by business segment consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , depreciation and amortization expense for water services decreased by   $2.9 million   to   $26.6 million   compared to   $29.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to lower composite depreciation rates stipulated in the pending water GRC   resulting from an updated depreciation study.  These lower composite rates will be used in the rate cycle for the years 2016 through 2018. The decrease resulting from the lower composite rates was partially offset by depreciation from the additions to utility plant.  The lower net depreciation expense has been reflected in the water revenue requirement.    
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , depreciation and amortization expense for electric services increased by   $285,000   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to additions to utility plant.

Maintenance expense for water services increased by   $203,000   due to planned maintenance activities and a higher level of unplanned maintenance activities performed during the first nine months of 2016.  Different factors contribute to the timing of when planned maintenance activities occur.  
    
  Maintenance expense for the electric segment decreased by   $139,000   due to a decrease in unplanned maintenance as compared to 2015.   
    
  Maintenance expense for contracted services decreased by   $231,000   due primarily to: (i) a decrease in labor costs associated with maintenance-related activities, such as mains, service lines, storage tanks and lift stations, and (ii) a decrease in outside services costs.

  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  , interest expense increased   $717,000   due largely to capitalized interest recorded during the first quarter of 2015 at the water segment resulting from the approval of additional allowance for funds used during construction in advice letter filings approved by the CPUC.  There was no similar item during in 2016.  There was also an increase in interest due to higher borrowings on the revolving credit facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   as compared to the same period in 2015. Borrowings on the revolving credit facility are expected to continue for the remainder of the year to fund operations and a portion of capital expenditures.

  For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , income tax expense by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Consolidated income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   decreased by approximately   $3.2 million   due to a decrease in pretax income and a lower ETR.  AWR's consolidated ETR was   37.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   39.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015  .  The consolidated ETR decreased as a result of changes in the ETR at GSWC, which was   38.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   41.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  GSWC's ETR decreased primarily due to differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow-through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily related to plant, rate-case and compensation items).  Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period.  The decrease in income tax expense for contracted services was due to a decrease in pretax income, partially offset by a higher ETR as a result of state income taxes.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are important to the portrayal of AWR s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments of AWR s management.  The need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex.  Management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items.  These judgments are based on AWR s historical experience, terms of existing contracts, AWR s observance of trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The critical accounting policies used in the preparation of Registrant s financial statements that it believes affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements presented in this report are described in    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    included in Registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  .  There have been no material changes to Registrant s critical accounting policies. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  AWR 
  Registrant s regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources.  A portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations.  AWR funds its operating expenses and pays dividends on its outstanding Common Shares primarily through dividends from GSWC.  The ability of GSWC to pay dividends to AWR is restricted by California law.  Under these restrictions, approximately   $208.7 million   was available on   September 30, 2016   to pay dividends to AWR.   
    
  When necessary, Registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on the credit ratings of AWR and GSWC and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets.  AWR anticipates that interest expense will increase due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program, and increases in market interest rates.  AWR believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at GSWC will continue to be recovered through water and electric rates charged to customers.   In addition, AWR has access to a syndicated credit facility, which expires in May 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,  AWR had access to   $100 million   under this syndicated credit facility.  In October 2016,  AWR elected to increase the aggregate commitment by an additional   $50 million   as permitted under the terms of the facility agreement. AWR can borrow up to   $150 million   under the revised facility and provide funds to its subsidiaries, GSWC and ASUS, in support of their operations.  The interest rate charged to GSWC and ASUS is sufficient to cover AWR s interest expense under the revolving credit facility.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $77.0 million   in borrowings outstanding under this facility and   $10.4 million   of letters of credit outstanding.  
    
  In April 2016, Standard   Poor's Rating Services ("S P") affirmed the A+ credit rating and stable outlook on both AWR and GSWC.  S P's debt ratings range from AAA (highest rating possible) to D (obligation is in default).  In December 2015, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") affirmed its A2 rating with a stable outlook for GSWC.  Securities ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold a security and are subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency.  Registrant believes that AWR s sound capital structure and A+ credit rating, combined with its financial discipline, will enable AWR to access the debt and equity markets.  However, unpredictable financial market conditions in the future may limit its access or impact the timing of when to access the market, in which case, Registrant may choose to temporarily reduce its capital spending.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , GSWC incurred $94.5 million in company-funded capital expenditures.  During 2016, GSWC's company-funded capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $105 to $115 million.  
    
  AWR s ability to pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends primarily upon cash flows from GSWC.  AWR intends to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on or about March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, subject to earnings and financial conditions, regulatory requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant.  Registrant has paid common dividends for over 80 consecutive years.  On November 1, 2016, AWR's Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the fourth quarter dividend from $0.224 per share to $0.242 per share on AWR's Common Shares.  Dividends on the Common Shares will be payable on December 1, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2016. 
    
  AWR's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program in 2014 and in 2015, authorizing AWR to repurchase up to 2.45 million shares of AWR's Common Shares.  Both stock repurchase programs were completed in May 2015.  The repurchase programs were intended to enable AWR to achieve a consolidated shareholders  equity ratio as a percentage of total capitalization that is more reflective of the current CPUC-authorized equity ratio for GSWC and an equity ratio for ASUS that is more consistent with the government contracting industry.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the ratio was approximately 55% equity and 45% debt (including short-term borrowings).  Based upon current expectations, including the projected infrastructure needs of GSWC and the expected growth of ASUS, which is currently not capital intensive, management does not anticipate AWR will conduct a secondary offering of its Common Shares in the near term.  
    
  Registrant's current liabilities may at times exceed its current assets.  Management believes that internally generated funds along with borrowings from AWR's credit facility are adequate to provide sufficient capital to maintain normal operations and to meet its capital and financing requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  : 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities have generally provided sufficient cash to fund operating requirements, including a portion of construction expenditures, and pay dividends.  Registrant s future cash flows from operating activities are expected to be affected by a number of factors, including utility regulation; infrastructure investment; maintenance expenses; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; per customer usage of water and electricity; weather and seasonality; conservation efforts; compliance with local governmental requirements, including mandatory restrictions on water use; and required cash contributions to pension and post-retirement plans.  Cash flows are also affected by drought-related costs resulting from California's mandate to reduce overall water usage.  GSWC has been authorized by the CPUC to track incremental drought-related costs incurred in a memorandum account for possible future recovery.  In addition, future cash flows from contracted services subsidiaries will depend on new business activities, existing operations, the construction of new and/or replacement infrastructure at military bases, timely price redeterminations, economic price and equitable adjustment of prices and timely collection of payments from the U.S. government and other prime contractors operating at the military bases. 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities are primarily generated by net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and deferred income taxes.  Cash generated by operations varies during the year.  Net cash provided by operating activities of Registrant was   $77.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $86.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was due, in part, to a reduction in cash generated by contracted services due to the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The billings (and cash receipts) for this construction work generally occur at completion of the work or in accordance with a billing schedule contractually agreed to with the U.S. government and/or other prime contractors.  Thus, cash flow from construction-related activities may fluctuate from period to period with such fluctuations representing timing differences of when the work is being performed and when the cash is received for payment of the work.   
    
  There were also lower tax payments made during   2015   largely as the result of the implementation of federal tax repair regulations during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by the extension in December 2015 of bonus depreciation for qualifying property.   In December 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended bonus depreciation for qualifying property through 2019.   Further offsetting the decrease was an increase in cash collected to recover GSWC's 2015 WRAM/MCBA balances. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the changes in net cash provided by operating activities. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  : 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $101.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $61.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The capital expenditures incurred for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were consistent with GSWC's capital investment program and were higher than the amounts incurred during the same period in 2015.  Registrant invests capital to provide essential services to its regulated customer base, while working with its regulators to have the opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on investment.  Registrant s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where infrastructure is replaced, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where new water treatment and delivery facilities are constructed.  GSWC may also be required from time to time to relocate existing infrastructure in order to accommodate local infrastructure improvement projects.  Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision. 
    
  ASUS funds its operating expenses primarily through internal operating sources, which include U.S. government funding under 50-year contracts for operations and maintenance costs and construction activities, as well as investments by, or loans from, AWR.  ASUS, in turn, provides funding to its subsidiaries.  
    
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities  : 
    
  Registrant s financing activities include primarily: (i) the sale proceeds from, and repurchase of, Common Shares and stock option exercises and short-term and long-term debt; (ii) the issuance and repayment of long-term debt and notes payable to banks; and (iii) the payment of dividends on Common Shares.  In order to finance new infrastructure, Registrant also receives customer advances (net of refunds) for, and contributions in aid of, construction.  Short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures until long-term financing is arranged. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $22.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $73.5 million   net cash used for the same period in   2015  .  This increase in cash provided was primarily due to AWR's repurchase of its Common Shares as part of the stock repurchase programs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , with no similar repurchases occurring during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, there was an increase in

     Table of Contents  

short-term borrowings from Registrant's revolving credit facility to fund the higher capital expenditure levels in the regulated water business during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. 
    
  GSWC 
  GSWC funds its operating expenses, payments on its debt, and dividends on its outstanding common shares and a portion of its construction expenditures through internal sources.  Internal sources of cash flow are provided primarily by retention of a portion of earnings from operating activities.  Internal cash generation is influenced by factors such as weather patterns, conservation efforts, environmental regulation, litigation, deferred taxes, changes in supply costs and regulatory decisions affecting GSWC s ability to recover these supply costs, timing of rate relief, increases in maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, surcharges authorized by the CPUC to enable GSWC to recover expenses previously incurred from customers and CPUC requirements to refund amounts previously charged to customers.  GSWC has been authorized by the CPUC to track incremental drought-related costs incurred in a memorandum account for possible future recovery. 
    
  GSWC may, at times, utilize external sources, including equity investments and short-term borrowings from AWR, and long-term debt to help fund a portion of its construction expenditures.  In addition, GSWC receives advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.  Advances for construction are generally refundable at a rate of 2.5% in equal annual installments over 40 years.  Amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction.  Utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from rate base.  Generally, GSWC amortizes contributions in aid of construction at the same composite rate of depreciation as used for the related property. 
    
  As is often the case with public utilities, GSWC s current liabilities may at times exceed its current assets.  Management believes that internally generated funds along with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings from AWR and shares issuances to AWR will be adequate to provide sufficient capital to enable GSWC to maintain normal operations and to meet its capital and financing requirements pending recovery of costs in rates. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  : 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $76.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $81.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to lower tax payments made during   2015   largely as a result of the implementation of federal tax repair regulations during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by the extension in December 2015 of bonus depreciation for qualifying property.  In December 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended bonus depreciation for qualifying property through 2019.    Further offsetting the decrease was an increase in cash collected to recover GSWC's 2015 WRAM/MCBA balances. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the changes in net cash provided by operating activities. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  : 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $99.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $75.8 million   for the same period in   2015   due to higher planned capital expenditures.  Cash used for capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $98.2 million  .  During 2016, GSWC's company-funded capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $105-115 million.  
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  : 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $23.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to net cash used of   $30.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in cash from financing activities resulted from a decrease in dividends paid by GSWC to AWR during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 due, in part, to an $8.3 million dividend paid instead by ASUS to AWR in 2016.  ASUS did not pay a dividend to AWR in 2015. There was also an increase in inter-company short-term borrowings to fund GSWC's higher capital expenditure levels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
    
  Registrant has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed.   
    
  In addition to contractual maturities, Registrant has certain debt instruments that contain an annual sinking fund or other principal payments.  Registrant believes that it will be able to refinance debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance, or private placement, of debt or equity.  Annual payments to service debt are generally made from cash flows from operations. 
    
  See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    section of the Registrant s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   for a detailed discussion of contractual obligations and other commitments. 

Contracted Services 
   Under the terms of the current utility privatization contracts with the U.S. government, each contract's price is subject to (a) price redetermination every three years after the initial two years of the contract, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, or (b) an economic price adjustment ( EPA ) on an annual basis.  All new contracts will be economic-price-adjustment contracts. In the event that ASUS (i) is managing more assets at specific military bases than were included in the U.S. government s request for proposal, (ii) is managing assets that are in substandard condition as compared to what was disclosed in the request for proposal, (iii) prudently incurs costs not contemplated under the terms of the utility privatization contract, and/or (iv) becomes subject to new regulatory requirements, such as more stringent water-quality standards, ASUS is permitted to file, and has filed, requests for equitable adjustment ( REA ).  The timely filing for and receipt of price redeterminations, EPAs and/or REAs continues to be critical in order for ASUS to recover increasing costs of operating and maintaining, and renewing and replacing the water and/or wastewater systems at the military bases it serves. 
  Under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the  Act ), substantial automatic spending cuts, known as "sequestration," have impacted the expected levels of Department of Defense budgeting.  ASUS has not experienced any earnings impact to its existing operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services, as utility privatization contracts are an "excepted service" within the Act.  While the ongoing effects of sequestration have been mitigated through the passage of a continuing resolution for the fiscal year 2017 Department of Defense budget, similar issues may arise as part of fiscal uncertainty and/or future debt-ceiling-limits imposed by Congress.  However, any future impact on ASUS and its operations will likely be limited to the timing of funding to pay for services rendered, delays in the processing of price redeterminations EPAs and/or REAs, issuance of contract modifications for new construction work not already funded by the U.S. government, and/or delays in the solicitation and/or awarding of new utility privatization opportunities under the Department of Defense utility privatization program. 
  The timing of future filings of price redeterminations and/or EPAs may be impacted by government actions, including audits or reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA") and/or the Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA").  Both DCAA and DCMA conduct, at times at the request of a contracting officer, audits/reviews of contractors for compliance with government guidance and regulations such as Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements ( DFARS ) and, as applicable, Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS").  If the DCAA/DCMA believes ASUS and/or the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries have accounted for costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of FAR, DFARS or applicable CAS, the auditor may recommend to the U.S. government administrative contracting officer that such costs be disallowed.  In addition, certain audit findings such as system deficiencies for government-contract-business-system requirements may result in delays in the timing of resolution of price redetermination and/or EPA filings and/or the ability to file new proposals with the U.S. government. 
  Below is a summary of price redeterminations, EPA, and REA filings by the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.  ASUS is current on all price redetermination and EPA filings for contracts at all of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. 

TUS   - The third price redetermination for Andrews Air Force Base, covering the period February 2014 through January 2017, was finalized through the issuance of a contract modification in July 2015, and provided for an annualized increase in operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement fees. 

ODUS   - The EPA for the Fort Lee privatization contract in Virginia, covering the one-year period beginning February 2016, was finalized in the third quarter of 2016.  The EPA for the other bases that ODUS operates in Virginia, covering the one-year period beginning April 2016, was finalized through the issuance of contract modifications in June 2016. 
     REA filings were made in 2015 to recover costs associated with work done at Joint-Base Langley Eustis, VA, under a new capital upgrade project.  The requests covered work that was approved to be performed by the base and included requests for additional revenue totaling $630,000.  These REA's are expected to be resolved in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  ODUS filed a REA to recover added costs incurred for a major renewal and replacement project.  These costs had been included in previously filed redeterminations but were withdrawn to be included in this REA.  ODUS expects this filing to be resolved in the fourth quarter of 2016.

PSUS   - The third redetermination for Fort Jackson, covering the period mid-February 2016 through mid-February 2019, was finalized in third quarter 2016. 

ONUS   - The third price redetermination for Fort Bragg, covering the period March 2016 through February 2019, was filed in February 2016 and is expected to be resolved in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
       
  New Privatization Contract Award 
  On July 12, 2016, ASUS was awarded a 50-year contract by the U.S. government to operate, maintain, and provide construction services for the water and wastewater systems at Eglin Air Force Base located in Florida.  The initial value of the contract is estimated at approximately $510 million over the 50-year period and is subject to annual economic price adjustments.  ASUS will assume operations at Eglin Air Force Base following the completion of a projected 8 to10 month transition period. 

Regulatory Matters 
  Pending General Rate Case Requests 
  In July 2014, GSWC filed a GRC for all of its water regions and the general office to establish rates for the years 2016 2018.  GSWC s requested capital budgets in the application average approximately $90 million a year for the three-year period.  The 2016 water gross margin is expected to decrease as compared to the currently adopted levels due, in part, to a decrease in annual depreciation expense resulting from an updated depreciation study and reduction in other expenses.  Hearings for the unresolved issues in the rate case were completed in June 2015, and settlements for certain items and legal briefs were filed in July 2015.  The consumption levels used to calculate rates for 2016-2018 and incorporated into the settlement with the CPUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates ("ORA") reflect the 2015 state-mandated conservation targets in effect at that time for each ratemaking area.   
  In July 2015, GSWC filed a motion with the CPUC for interim water rates to be effective January 1, 2016 in the event the CPUC did not issue a final decision on the water GRC by January 1, 2016.  As part of the filing, GSWC also requested authorization to establish a memorandum account to track the difference between the interim rates, which GSWC proposed to remain at current levels, and final rates once approved by the CPUC.  The CPUC approved this filing in October 2015.  A proposed decision on this rate case is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Once a final decision is issued, new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2016.  
  Cost of Capital Proceeding for Water Regions 
  The CPUC issued a decision on GSWC s last water cost-of-capital proceeding in July 2012.  As a result, GSWC's current water authorized return on equity of 9.43% has remained unchanged since 2013.  GSWC was scheduled to file its next cost-of-capital application in March 2016 based on an extension previously granted.  In December 2015, GSWC, along with three other Class A California water companies, filed a request with the CPUC for a further extension by which each of them is required to file its next cost-of-capital application.  On February 1, 2016, the CPUC approved the one-year extension, until March 31, 2017, by which date each Class A Utility is to file its next cost-of-capital application.  
  Balanced Rates Order Instituting Rulemaking 
  In April 2015, the CPUC issued a ruling establishing a second phase to its on-going rulemaking addressing the CPUC's Water Action Plan objective of setting rates that balance investment, conservation, and affordability.  The intended purpose of the second phase is to review the CPUC s water-conservation rate structure, tiered rates, forecasting methods, accounting mechanisms and other standards and programs that guide investor-owned water utility rates, charges, and cost recovery. In October 2016, the CPUC issued a proposed decision on this objective. Among other things, the proposed decision retains the WRAM mechanism, institutes a sales reconciliation mechanism to adjust forecasted water consumption authorized by the CPUC based on actual consumption, changes tiered rates to include a very high tiered rate and a super user charge aimed at high-usage customers, implements advanced metering infrastructure for all customers, and shifts more revenue recovery through monthly fixed charges versus quantity charges.  A final decision on this phase is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. GSWC cannot predict the final outcome of this proceeding. 
    
  Nipomo Supplemental Water Project 
  In November 2015, GSWC filed an application to recover the costs of a water supply project intended to deliver water to the Nipomo Mesa area in GSWC s Santa Maria ratemaking area.  In February 2016, GSWC and ORA jointly filed a motion to adopt a settlement, which resolved all of the cost-recovery issues in GSWC s application.  In September 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the settlement.  The costs of this water project have been included in Santa Maria rates effective October 1, 2016.

New Service Territory Application, Sutter County 
  On June 26, 2014, the CPUC approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity ("CPCN") application granting GSWC the authority to provide water utility services to an area to be developed near Sacramento, in Sutter County, California, called Sutter Pointe.  The CPUC's decision approved a settlement that was jointly filed by GSWC, Sutter County, the Sutter Pointe Developers, and a coalition of Sutter County residents.  With the CPUC's approval, GSWC will create a water service district to supply the Sutter Pointe development with groundwater and surface water from the Sacramento River.  The project will involve the construction of underground infrastructure and groundwater wells with a treatment plant and storage facility to serve retail, industrial and approximately 17,000 residential customers at final build-out.  The decision also sets a cap on the revenue requirement per Sutter Pointe customer during the first two rate cycles.  In August 2014, ORA filed an application for rehearing on the CPCN application in regard to the rate cap adopted by the CPUC.  In September 2016 the CPUC adopted a settlement reached between GSWC and ORA which modified the rate cap.  
  As part of the CPCN agreement, GSWC requested approval from the CPUC to acquire the water system that currently serves the community of Robbins in Sutter County.  The CPUC denied the request due to objections to the location of a proposed new well. The denial was made without prejudice, which provides GSWC an opportunity to re-file the request for approval at a future date.   
  BVES General Rate Case 
  In BVES's previous GRC decision, the CPUC adopted an uncontested settlement agreement between BVES, ORA and three other parties, which resolved many of the issues in that GRC proceeding.  Included in the settlement adopted by the CPUC was a provision that BVES would file its next GRC application on or prior to January 31, 2016.  In November 2015, BVES filed a petition to modify the GRC decision requesting a change to the provision of the settlement that would defer the GRC filing by one year, to 2017.  In March 2016, the CPUC issued a decision granting BVES's request to defer the GRC to March 31, 2017.  
  Other Regulatory Matters 
  See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Matters    section of the Registrant s Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31,   2015   for a detailed discussion of other regulatory matters. 

Environmental Matters 
    
  AWR s subsidiaries are subject to stringent environmental regulations, including the 1996 amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. 
    
  GSWC is required to comply with the safe drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the Division of Drinking Water ("DDW"), under the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ).  The EPA regulates contaminants that may have adverse health effects that are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern, and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction.  The DDW, acting on behalf of the EPA, administers the EPA s program in California.  Similar state agencies administer these rules in the other states in which Registrant operates. 
    
  GSWC currently tests its water supplies and water systems according to, among other things, requirements listed in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ).  In compliance with the SDWA and to assure a safe drinking water supply to its customers, GSWC has incurred operating costs for testing to determine the levels, if any, of the constituents in its sources of supply and additional expense to treat contaminants in order to meet the federal and state maximum contaminant level ( MCL ) standards and customer expectations.   
    
  GSWC expects to incur additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs to maintain or improve the quality of water delivered to its customers in light of anticipated stress on water resources associated with watershed and aquifer pollution, as well as to meet future water quality standards.  The CPUC ratemaking process provides GSWC with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs in future filings associated with achieving water quality standards.  Management believes that such incurred and expected future costs should be authorized for recovery by the CPUC.

Water Supply 
    
  See    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations California Drought    section of the Registrant s Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31,   2015   for a detailed discussion of water supply issues.  The discussion below focuses on significant matters and changes since December 31,   2015  . 
    
  California Drought 
  In response to the ongoing drought experienced in California, the SWRCB has taken various actions to ensure reduced water usage throughout the State, and to track reductions by larger urban water suppliers.  GSWC has filed appropriate drought contingency plans, or Staged Mandatory Water Conservation and Rationing Plan, with the CPUC to meet the SWRCB requirements.  GSWC s water usage reductions have met the SWRCB requirements through activation of its Stage 1 of the drought contingency plan, which includes voluntary reductions and limits on outdoor water use. 
  California's ongoing period of drought has resulted in reduced recharge to the state's groundwater basins.  GSWC utilizes groundwater from numerous groundwater basins throughout the state.  Several of these basins, especially smaller basins, are experiencing dropping groundwater levels.  Several of GSWC's service areas rely on groundwater as their only source of supply.  Given the critical nature of the groundwater levels in the Central Coast area, GSWC has implemented mandatory water restrictions in certain service areas, moving to higher stages of the Staged Mandatory Water Conservation and Rationing Plan for those areas.  Should dry conditions persist through the remainder of 2016, areas served by these smaller basins may experience further mandatory conservation measures in the future.  In the event of water supply shortages beyond the mandated reductions, GSWC would need to transport additional water from other areas, increasing the cost of water supply. 
  As of October 25, 2016, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates almost 62 percent of California in the rank of  Severe Drought,  which is an improvement from April 2016 when 74 percent was ranked  Severe Drought.   
  Metropolitan Water District/ State Water Project 
  GSWC supplements groundwater production with wholesale purchases from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("MWD") member agencies. Water supplies available to the MWD through the State Water Project ("SWP") vary from year to year based on several factors.  Every year, the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") establishes the SWP allocation for water deliveries to state water contractors.  DWR generally establishes a percentage allocation of delivery requests based on a number of factors, including weather patterns, snow-pack levels, reservoir levels and biological diversion restrictions.  The SWP is a major source of water for the MWD.  
  In July 2015, MWD implemented a mandatory reduction in overall supply delivery of 15 percent due to the drought.  In April 2016, the SWP allocation was increased to 60 percent of requested orders as a result of improved hydrologic conditions in Northern California.  In response, MWD lifted its mandatory reduction of supplies effective May 10, 2016 and moved into a  Water Supply Alert  condition. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Registrant is subject to newly issued requirements as well as changes in existing requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  Differences in financial reporting between periods for GSWC could occur unless and until the CPUC approves such changes for conformity through regulatory proceedings.  See Note 1 of Unaudited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Registrant is exposed to certain market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity at BVES and other economic conditions.  Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in prevailing market rates and prices. 
    
  The quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are discussed in   Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  , contained in Registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report, of the design and operation of our  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Exchange Act.  Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, were adequate and effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  (b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
    
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  On May 12, 2016, Casitas Municipal Water District filed an eminent domain lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court against GSWC (  Casitas Municipal Water District v. Golden State Water Company, Case No. 56-2016-00481628-CU-EI-VTA  ) to acquire the property and assets of GSWC located in its Ojai service area.  The lawsuit included additional causes of action related to claims of potential damages resulting from any delay caused by GSWC seeking relief in the prior action regarding the use of Mello-Roos funds for such a taking of property.  At this time, management cannot predict the outcome of this eminent domain proceeding. 
    
  On December 9, 2014, the City of Claremont, California filed an eminent domain lawsuit in the County of Los Angeles Superior Court against GSWC (  City of Claremont v. Golden State Water Company,   Case No. BC 566125) to acquire the portion of GSWC's system which serves the City of Claremont.  Closing arguments for the phase of the trial determining Claremont's right to seize the system by eminent domain concluded in August 2016, with a decision expected within 90 days after the closing arguments.  At this time, management cannot predict the outcome of this eminent domain proceeding.   
    
  Registrant is subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.  Other than those disclosed in this Form 10-Q and in Registrant s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  , no other legal proceedings are pending, which are believed to be material.  Management believes that rate recovery, proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to insure against property, general liability and workers  compensation claims incurred in the ordinary course of business.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no significant changes in the risk factors disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

  (2)               Of this amount, 137,000 Common Shares were acquired on the open market for employees pursuant to the Company's 401(k) plan and the remainder were acquired on the open market for participants in the Common Share Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  
  (3)              Neither the 401(k) plan nor the Common Share Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan contain a maximum number of common shares that may be purchased in the open market.
