The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with our accounting practices described in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Such adjustments, other than nonrecurring adjustments that have been separately disclosed, are of a normal, recurring nature. The operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year of future interim periods. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, do not include all the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) with respect to annual financial statements.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition:  The Company recognizes revenues and the related costs upon delivery to the customer, at which time there is a transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification    ( ASC ) 605-10-S99 .  The Company classifies customer rebates as sales deductions in accordance with the requirements of ASC 605-50-25.

Shipping Costs:  The Company records shipping costs incurred as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping costs incurred were approximately $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Shipping costs incurred were approximately $4.8 million and $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Master Settlement Agreement Escrow Account:   Pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement (the  MSA ) entered into in November 1998 by most states (represented by their attorneys general acting through the National Association of Attorneys General) and subsequent states  statutes, a  cigarette manufacturer  (which is defined to include a manufacturer of make-your-own ( MYO ) cigarette tobacco) has the option of either becoming a signatory to the MSA or opening, funding, and maintaining an escrow account to have funds available for certain potential tobacco-related liabilities, with sub-accounts on behalf of each settling state.  The Company has chosen to open and fund an escrow account as its method of compliance.  It is the Company s policy to record amounts on deposit in the escrow account for prior years as a non-current asset.  Each year s annual obligation is required to be deposited in the escrow account by April 15 of the following year.  In addition to the annual deposit, many states have elected to require quarterly deposits for the previous quarter s sales. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, NATC had on deposit approximately $31.9 million and $31.8 million, respectively, in escrow. 

Effective April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax on MYO products was increased from $1.0969 per pound to $24.78 per pound of tobacco. With this significant increase in the federal excise tax, the Company discontinued its generic category of MYO but continues to sell the Zig-Zag branded MYO. For further discussion of the MSA see our Form S-1/A filed on April 28, 2016 with the SEC, pages F-11 and F-12.

Table of Contents 

The following table represents the amount of deposits by sales year for the MSA escrow account and reflects the decline in annual deposits beginning in 2009, due to the significant increase in federal excise taxes, as described above:

Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ):

On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ( FSPTCA ) authorized the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to immediately regulate the manufacture, sale and marketing of four categories of tobacco products   cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco. On August 8, 2016, the FDA deeming regulation became effective. The deeming regulation gave the FDA the authority to additionally regulate  cigars, pipe tobacco, e-cigarettes, vaporizers and e-liquids. 

The FDA assesses tobacco product user fees on six classes of regulated tobacco products and computes user fees using a methodology similar to the methodology used by the U.S Department of Agriculture to compute the Tobacco Transition Payment Program ( TTPP , also known as the  Tobacco Buyout ) assessment. First, the total annual congressionally established user fee assessment is allocated among the six classes of tobacco products using the federal excise tax weighted market share of tobacco products subject to regulation. Then, the assessment for each class of tobacco products is divided among individual manufacturers and importers.

Prior to October 1, 2016, these FDA user fees applied only to those products then regulated by the FDA.  Effective October 1, 2016, the FDA began additionally applying FDA user fees to newly deemed tobacco products subject to FDA user fees as described above, i.e., cigars and pipe tobacco. The Company estimates the fee assessed to it for cigars and pipe tobacco will be approximately $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted:

The Company adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost  in 2016 .  This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Based on the requirements of this ASU, the Company has retrospectively applied ASU 2015-03 to the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet, which has resulted in $6.3 million being reclassified to direct deduction of the carrying amount of the debt.

Table of Contents 

The Company adopted ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes ( Topic 740):  Balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  in 2016. This ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The Company has retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet, which has resulted in $0.4 million of deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to a noncurrent deferred tax liability.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  in 2016. This ASU simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements and classifications on the statement of cash flows. This ASU results in excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the statement of income. The adoption of this ASU had no effect on the Company s balance sheet or statements of income for 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either a full retrospective or retrospective with cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting year. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The amendments in this ASU require entities that measure inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which supersedes Topic 840,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required, so that users are able to understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. At transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients related to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date of ASU 2016-02. An entity that elects to use the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements.

Note 4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of ASC 825, Financial Instruments. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using the methods and assumptions described below. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  Cash and cash equivalents are by definition short-term and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Accounts Receivable:  The fair value of accounts receivable approximates their carrying value.

Revolving Credit Facility:  The fair value of the revolving credit facility approximates its carrying value.

Long-Term Debt:  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the PIK Toggle Notes approximates their face amounts of $60.1 million. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the 7% Senior Notes approximates their face amounts of $12.6 million.

As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of NATC s First Lien Term Loan and NATC s Second Lien Term Loan approximate their face amounts of $147.7 million and $60.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of NATC s First Lien Term Loan and NATC s Second Lien Term Loan approximate their face amounts of $151.7 million and $80.0 million, respectively.

Foreign Exchange:  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no open foreign exchange forward contracts.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had seven outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts for the purchase of 5.1 million Euros.  The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts was based upon the quoted market price that resulted in an insignificant asset as of December 31, 2015.

Note 5. Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method for approximately 55% of the inventories.  Leaf tobacco is presented in current assets in accordance with standard industry practice, notwithstanding the fact that such tobaccos are carried longer than one year for the purpose of curing.

The components of inventories are as follows:

The Company recorded inventory valuation allowances of $0.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2015.

Long-term Debt

On January 13, 2014, NATC entered into (i) a $170 million First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement among NATC, the Company, NATC Holding and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the  First Lien Credit Agreement ), (ii) a $80 million Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement among NATC, the Company, NATC Holding and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the  Second Lien Credit Agreement ), and (iii) a $40 million ABL Credit Agreement among NATC, NATC Holding and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,  as ABL Agent (the  Revolving Credit Facility ).

First Lien Credit Agreement

All of NATC s subsidiaries, as well as the Company and NATC Holding, are guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement.  TPLLC and its subsidiary are not guarantors of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The First Lien Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors thereunder, including a pledge of the capital stock of NATC and its subsidiaries held by NATC Holding, NATC or any guarantor, other than certain excluded assets (the  Collateral ).  The loans designated as LIBOR rate loans bear interest at LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 6.50% and the loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at the (i) highest of (A) the Prime Rate, (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (C) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% and (D) 2.25% per year plus (ii) 5.50%. The weighted average interest rate at September 30, 2016 was 9.0%. The First Lien Credit Agreement matures in January 2020.

Table of Contents 

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which impose restrictions on, among other things, the ability of NATC and its subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends, sell assets, and incur debt and additional liens. In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires NATC to maintain a total leverage ratio as follows:

NATC is required to make prepayments under the First Lien Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. NATC made a prepayment of approximately $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2016.

Second Lien Credit Agreement

The Second Lien Credit Agreement has the benefit of a second priority security interest in the Collateral and is guaranteed by the same entities as the First Lien Credit Agreement.  The Second Lien Credit Agreement, contains substantially similar representations and warranties, events of default and covenants as the First Lien Credit Agreement; provided, however, that the total leverage ratio required to be maintained by NATC under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is as follows:

Under the Second Lien Credit Agreement the loans designated as LIBOR rate loans bear interest at the LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 10.25% and the loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at (i) the highest of (A) the Prime Rate, (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (C) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% and (D) 2.25% per year plus (ii) 9.25%.  The weighted average interest rate at September 30, 2016 was 11.5%. The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures in July 2020. In connection with the Company s IPO in May of 2016, the Company prepaid $20 million of the borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (see Note 3).

Revolving Credit Facility

The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate commitments of up to $40 million, subject to a borrowing base, which is calculated as the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (A) the product of 70% multiplied by the value of  eligible inventory  and (B) the product of 85% multiplied by the net recovery percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by the value of eligible inventory, plus (iii) the lesser of (A) the product of 75% multiplied by the value of eligible inventory and (B) the product of 85% multiplied by the net recovery percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by the value of the eligible finished goods inventory, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves established by the administrative agent.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are, at the option of NATC, equal to the applicable Base Rate or LIBOR Rate plus the applicable Interest Margin, as defined below:

The Revolving Credit Facility matures in January 2019 and there was no outstanding balance at September 30, 2016.

PIK Toggle Notes

On January 13, 2014, the Company issued PIK Toggle Notes ( PIK Toggle Notes ) to Standard General Master Fund, L.P. ( Standard General ) with a principal amount of $45 million and warrants to purchase 42,424 of the Company s common stock at $.01 per share, as adjusted for stock splits and other events specified in the agreement. After adjustment for the stock split effected in connection with our IPO of 10.43174381 to 1, the warrants have been adjusted to provide for the purchase of 442,558 of the Company s common stock. Due to the issuance of the warrants, the PIK Toggle Notes had an original issue discount of $1.7 million and were initially valued at $43.3 million. The PIK Toggle Notes were scheduled to mature and the warrants to expire on January 13, 2021.

The PIK Toggle Notes accrued interest based on the LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 13.75%. Interest was payable on the last day of each quarter and upon maturity. The Company had the flexibility to pay interest in kind through an increase in the principal amount at the same interest rate as the PIK Toggle Notes. The Company chose to increase the PIK Toggle Notes for all interest for the first three months of 2016.

The PIK Toggle Notes contained covenants which limited the ability of the Company to enter into transactions with affiliates and make dividends or other distributions or repurchase capital stock. The PIK Toggle Notes were unsecured and did not limit the Company s ability to incur additional debt or liens.

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016, the Company redeemed and retired all of the outstanding PIK Toggle Notes in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of the Company s voting common stock (see Note 3).

7% Senior Notes

In January of 2014, the Company issued 7% Senior Notes to various stockholders with a principal amount of $11 million and warrants to purchase 11,000,000 units of membership interests in Intrepid, which represented 40% of the Intrepid Common Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis, at a purchase price of $1.00 per unit. Due to the issuance of the Intrepid warrants, the 7% Senior Notes had an original issue discount of $2.8 million and were initially valued at $8.2 million. The 7% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature and the warrants to expire on December 31, 2023.

The 7% Senior Notes accrued interest at a fixed rate of 7% per annum. Interest was payable on the last business day of June and December in each year and provided that the Company was permitted to elect to pay all or a portion of the interest in kind. The Company made such election for all of 2014 and 2015.

The 7% Senior Notes were the general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equally with the Company s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding. Redemptions of the 7% Senior Notes could be made by the Company at any time without penalty or premium.

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016, we redeemed and retired all of the outstanding 7% Senior Notes in exchange for shares of the Company s voting common stock (see Note 3).

Restricted / Non-Restricted Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements

The payment of principal and interest on the First Lien Term Loan, Second Lien Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by or obligations of NATC and its subsidiaries ( Issuer/Restricted ). TPLLC and its subsidiary ( Non-Restricted ) are not guarantors of the First Lien Term Loan, Second Lien Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. The separate financial statements of the Issuer/Restricted are not included herein because the Issuer/Restricted are the Company s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries and are jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally liable for the obligations represented by the First Lien Term Loan, Second Lien Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that the consolidating financial information for the Issuer/Restricted and the Non-Restricted provide information that is more meaningful in understanding the financial position of the Issuer/Restricted than separate financial statements of the Issuer/Restricted.

The following consolidating financial information presents consolidating financial data for the Issuer/Restricted, Non-Restricted and an elimination column for adjustments to arrive at the information for the Company on a consolidated basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The principal elimination entries set forth below eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.

Note 9. Income Taxes:

The Company has determined, that at September 30, 2016, its ability to realize future benefits of certain net deferred tax assets does not meet the  more likely than not  criteria in ASC 740, Income Taxes; therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded. The Company s income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 does not bear the normal relationship to income before income taxes because of net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized and were partially offset by certain minimum state income taxes.

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10-25, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company has determined that they did not have any uncertain tax positions requiring recognition under the provisions of ASC 740-10-25. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions, if any, as part of interest expense. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.  In general, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for years prior to 2013.

Note 10. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans:

The components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost are as follows:

NATC has a defined benefit pension plan covering its employees. Benefits for the hourly employees are based on a stated benefit per year of service, reduced by amounts earned in a previous plan. Benefits for salaried employees are based on years of service and the employees  final compensation. This defined benefit plan is frozen.

NATC sponsored a defined benefit postretirement plan that covered hourly employees. This plan provides medical and dental benefits. This plan is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually.

NATC expects to contribute approximately $0.3 million to its postretirement plan in 2016 for the payment of benefits. Plan contributions and benefits have amounted to $247 and $250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. NATC expects to make no contributions to the pension plan in the year ending December 31, 2016.

Note 11. Share Incentive Plans:

On April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Turning Point Brands, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ) and approved a form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the  Form Award Agreement ) pursuant to which awards under the 2015 Plan may be granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. In addition, the 2015 Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified stock options to employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the 2015 Plan, 1,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company are reserved for issuance as awards to employees, consultants and non-employee directors as compensation for past or future services or the attainment of certain performance goals. The 2015 Plan is scheduled to terminate on April 27, 2026. The 2015 Plan is administrated by a committee (the  Committee ) of the Company s Board of Directors. The Committee determines the criteria for the vesting period, with such criteria to be specified in the award agreement. As of September 30, 2016, 26,508 shares of restricted stock and 53,996 options have been granted to employees of NATC under the 2015 Plan. There are 1,319,496 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan.

On February 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the North Atlantic Holding Company, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2006 Plan ) and approved a form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the  Form Award Agreement ) pursuant to which awards under the 2006 Plan may be granted to employees.  The 2006 Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards.  Upon the adoption of the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in connection with its IPO (see Note 3) the Company determined that no additional grants would be made under the 2006 Plan, however all awards issued under the plan that have not been previously terminated or forfeited remain outstanding and continue unaffected.

There are no shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Stock option activity for the 2006 and 2015 Plans is summarized below:

Under the 2006 Plan, the total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9 and $7, respectively.

At September 30, 2016, under the 2006 Plan, the outstanding stock options  exercise price for 980,096 options is $1.06 per share all of which are exercisable. The outstanding stock options  exercise price for 673,677 options is $3.83 per share all of which are exercisable. The weighted average of the remaining lives of the outstanding stock options is approximately 1.2 years for the options with the $1.06 exercise price, and 6.0 years for the options with the $3.83 exercise price. The Company estimates that the expected life of all stock options is ten years from the date of grant. For the $1.06 per share options, the weighted average fair value of options was determined using the Black-Scholes model assuming a ten-year life from grant date; a current share price and exercise price of $1.06; risk free interest rate of 4.366%; a volatility of 30%; and no assumed dividend yield.  Based on these assumptions, the fair value of these options is approximately $0.54 per share option granted. For the $3.83 per share options,   the weighted average fair value of options was determined using the Black-Scholes model assuming a ten-year life from grant date; a current share price and exercise price of $3.83; risk-free interest rate of 3.57%; a volatility of 40%; and no assumed dividend yield.  Based on these assumptions, the fair value of these options is approximately $2.17 per share option granted.

28 

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2016, under the 2015 Plan, the outstanding stock options  exercise price for 53,996 options is $9.26 per share of which 26,998 are exercisable. The weighted average of the remaining lives of the outstanding stock options is approximately 9.8 years. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the expected life at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the average long-term historical volatilities of peer companies. We intend to continue to consistently use the same group of publicly traded peer companies to determine expected volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding volatility of our share price becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose. Also, due to our limited trading history, we are using the  simplified method  to calculate expected holding periods, which represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We will continue to use this method until we have sufficient historical exercise experience to give us confidence that our calculations based on such experience will be reliable. Based on these assumptions we are using, a current share and exercise price of $9.26, risk free interest rate of 1.159%, expected volatility of 25.4%, expected life of options of 5.375 years and no assumed dividend yield, the fair value of these options determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model is approximately $2.37 per share option granted.

The Company has recorded compensation expense related to the options based on the provisions of ASC 718 under which the fixed portion of such expense is determined as the fair value of the options on the date of grant and amortized over the vesting period. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $99 and $37 in the consolidated statements of income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and approximately $132 and $129 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 12. Unit Incentive Plans and Warrants for Intrepid Brands, LLC:

Effective August 7, 2014, the Company adopted the Intrepid Brands, LLC 2014 Option Plan ( 2014 Plan ) for units of ownership in Intrepid. The purpose of the 2014 Plan was   to promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by linking the personal interests of the service providers (including employees, consultants and managers) to those of Company equity holders and by providing such individuals with an incentive for outstanding performance to generate superior returns to Company equity holders. 

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016 all options outstanding under the 2014 Plan were repurchased for aggregate cash consideration of $683 which included $22 of payroll taxes (see Note 3). With the repurchase of the options, the 2014 Plan was terminated.

In January of 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase 11,000,000 units of membership interests in Intrepid (the  Intrepid Warrants ) concurrent with the 7% Senior Notes (see Note 8). This represented 40% of the Intrepid Common Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis, at a purchase price of $1.00 per unit. The warrants were exercisable beginning January 21, 2014 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023.

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016 all outstanding Intrepid Warrants were repurchased for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $5.5 million (see Note 3).

Note 13. Contingencies:

The Company is involved in various claims and actions that arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that the resolution of the proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Note 14. Earnings Per Share:

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations of net income:

Due to the IPO in May 2016, the Company s weighted average shares and basic and diluted earnings per share are significantly different as of September 30, 2016 when compared to prior periods. See Note 3, for a description of the IPO and shares issued in connection herewith.

Note 15. Parent-Only Financial Information:

The Company is a holding company with independent operations including cash and its investments in its subsidiaries.

All of NATC s subsidiaries are wholly-owned and guarantee the First Lien Term Loan and the Second Lien Term Loan of NATC on a full, unconditional, and joint and several basis. Within the First Lien Term Loan and the Second Lien Term Loan there are no significant restrictions on the ability of NATC to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan, but NATC is subject to significant restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. NATC and its subsidiaries are generally unable to pay dividends and make other restricted payments to the Company, except in limited circumstances, including (i) to pay certain costs in the ordinary course of business, (ii) to redeem, retire or otherwise acquire certain of our outstanding equity interest and (iii) to pay certain tax obligations. As a result of such restrictions on the Company s subsidiaries  ability to make distributions to the Company, $233,588 of its consolidated total assets are currently restricted assets of its consolidated subsidiaries, which may not be transferred to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party. The Company has disclosed the amount of restricted total assets rather than restricted net assets due to the negative net assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries.

TPLLC and Intrepid are wholly-owned by the Company. TPLLC and its subsidiary are not guarantors of the First Lien Term Loan and Second Lien Term Loan.

     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, with our annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are included in our prospectus dated May 10, 2016, filed with the SEC in accordance with Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act on May 12, 2016 (the  Prospectus ) and with the Risk Factors included in the Prospectus. In addition, this discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make. See  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties that are discussed in  Risk Factors  in our Prospectus.

The following discussion relates to the interim unaudited financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In this discussion, unless the context requires otherwise, references to  our Company   we,   our,  or  us  refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. References to  TPB  refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc. without any of its subsidiaries. Dollars are in thousands, except were designated and per share data.  We were incorporated in 2004 under the name North Atlantic Holding Company, Inc. On November 4, 2015, we changed our name to Turning Point Brands, Inc. Many of the amounts and percentages in this discussion have been rounded for convenience of presentation.

Overview

We are a leading independent provider of Other Tobacco Products ( OTP ) in the U.S. We sell a wide range of products across the OTP spectrum, including moist snuff, loose leaf chewing tobacco, premium cigarette papers, make-your-own ( MYO ) cigar wraps and cigar smoking tobacco, cigars, liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. We do not sell cigarettes. We estimate that the OTP industry generated approximately $10.0 billion in manufacturer revenue in 2014. In contrast to manufactured cigarettes, which have been experiencing declining sales for decades based on data published by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ( TTB ), the OTP industry is demonstrating increased consumer appeal. For instance, according to Management Science Associates Incorporated ( MSAi ) 1 , OTP consumer units shipped to retail increased by approximately 2% from 2013 to 2014 and approximately 3% from 2014 to 2015.

The Company s reportable segments are (1) smokeless products, which include chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco, (2) smoking products, which principally include cigarette papers, MYO cigar wraps and cigars, and (3) NewGen products, which include liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products and non-nicotine/non-tobacco products.

Our portfolio of brands includes some of the most widely recognized names in the OTP industry, such as  Zig-Zag    ,  Beech-Nut    ,  Stoker s    ,  Trophy    ,  Havana Blossom    ,  Durango    ,  Our Pride     and our newest brand,  Primal    .

We generate revenues from the sale of our products primarily to wholesale distributors who in turn resell them to retail operations, as well as from the sale of our products directly to retail operations. Our net sales, which include federal excise taxes, consist of gross sales, net of cash discounts, returns, and selling and marketing allowances.

Our principal operating expenses include the cost of raw materials used to manufacture the limited number of our products which we manufacture; the cost of finished products, which are purchased goods; federal excise taxes; legal expenses and compensation expenses, including benefits and costs of salaried personnel. Our other principal expenses include interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and other expenses.

Initial Public Offering ( IPO )

On May 10, 2016, we priced the initial public offering (the  IPO ) of our voting common stock.  In the IPO, we sold 6,210,000 shares of our voting common stock (including 810,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters  option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments (the  Over-allotment Option )) at a price per share of $10.00.  The IPO closed on May 13, 2016 and the sale of shares pursuant to the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option closed on May 19, 2016.

1  Management Science Associates, Inc. ( MSAi ) administers a proprietary information system that captures sales from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to over 250,000 U.S. retailers.  MST excludes pouch products.

Table of Contents 

The Company raised a total of approximately $62.1 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or $58.2 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and other associated costs.  We used the proceeds from the IPO together with cash on hand to pay fees and expenses related to the IPO, repurchase outstanding warrants and options issued by our subsidiary, Intrepid Brands LLC ( Intrepid ), repay approximately $34 million of our floating rate PIK Toggle Notes due 2021 (the  PIK Toggle Notes ) and to repay approximately $20 million of the borrowings outstanding under our second lien credit facility.

Critical Accounting Policies and Uses of Estimates

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Prospectus, dated May 10, 2016 related to the IPO.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted:

The Company adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost  in 2016 .  This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Based on the requirements of this ASU, the Company has retrospectively applied ASU 2015-03 to the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet which has resulted in $6.3 million being reclassified to direct deduction of the carrying amount of the debt.

The Company adopted ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes ( Topic 740):  Balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  in 2016. This ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The Company has retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet which has resulted in $0.4 million of deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to a noncurrent deferred tax liability.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  in 2016. This ASU simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements and classifications on the statement of cash flows. This ASU results in excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the statement of income. The adoption of this ASU had no effect on the Company s balance sheet or statements of income for 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ), ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either a full retrospective or retrospective with cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting year. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The amendments in this ASU require entities that measure inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which supersedes Topic 840,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required, so that users are able to understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. At transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients related to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date of ASU 2016-02. An entity that elects to use the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Net Sales  . Company net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $51.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million or 0.9% from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease was the result of decreases in the Smoking Products and NewGen Products segments, partially offset by an increase in net sales in the Smokeless Products segment.

Net sales for the Smokeless Products segment for the current period increased $0.2 million or 1.2% to $18.9 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by the ongoing roll-out of Stoker moist snuff tobacco ( MST ) 1.2oz. cans, pricing in both chewing tobacco and MST and continued modest, progress in international sales of MST. As a result of the successful promotions at an industry trade show at the close of the second quarter 2016, Smokeless product sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were lower by approximately $1.3 million as sales shifted into the second quarter from the third quarter.  The prior year s Smokeless revenue included the initial introductory volumes of Stoker s MST cans.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, volume decreased 8.7% principally due to the aforementioned second quarter trade show and the comparison to the year ago introductory pipeline volumes for Stoker s MST cans and one less shipping day.  Price/mix increased 9.9%.

Year over year industry volumes for chewing tobacco declined by approximately 5% in the quarter while MST year over year industry volumes grew 1%, according to MSAi. The Company grew its MSAi share in both chewing tobacco and MST.  Shipments of Stoker s MST cans to retail grew at high single-digit rates, according to MSAi.

Net sales for the Smoking Products segment decreased $0.4 million or 1.5% to $28.8 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, continued growth in our Zig-Zag MYO cigar wraps was offset by the timing of Canadian cigarette paper orders, timing of U.S. cigarette paper promotional orders and by continued, albeit moderating, declines in cigar sales.  Modest progress on Zig-Zag cigar shipments to Canada continued. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, volume decreased 3.9% due to the aforementioned timing in cigarette paper orders, declines in cigar volumes and one less shipping day.  Price/mix increased 2.3%.

Industry volumes for cigarette papers decreased by low-single digits and MYO cigar wraps increased by double digits, according to MSAi.  The Company grew share in cigar wraps on the continuing rollout of the new Zig-Zag cigarillo sized wraps and in cigarette papers, according to MSAi.

Net sales of the NewGen Products segment decreased $0.3 million or 7.3% to $3.3 million in comparison to the corresponding period of the prior year due both to competitor introductions of new products and to the continuing movement of industry vapor volumes away from traditional retail, where we are positioned with our sales efforts, to vape and accessory shops, where the company is building its sales infrastructure.  For the quarter, NewGen volume increased 1.2% driven by the Primal Herbal products roll-out. Price/mix accounted for a decrease of 8.5%. 

From a retail distribution perspective, the number of traditional outlets carrying e-liquid and vaporizers declined sharply, as noted by MSAi, demonstrating the shift out of traditional retail to alternative channels.

Cost of Sales  .   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales increased to $26.3 million from $26.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million, or 1.0%, principally due to an increase in net sales in the smokeless product segment and product mix.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the Smokeless Products segment increased to $9.5 million from $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million, or 2.8%, principally due to an increase in net sales of products with a higher manufacturing cost.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the Smoking Products segment increased to $14.3 million from $14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.7%, principally due to an increase in sales volume of cigar wraps, which have higher manufacturing costs than other products in the segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the NewGen products segment decreased to $2.5 million from $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 3.7%, principally due to a reduction in sales volume of vaporizers and e-cigarettes.

Gross Profit  . Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $24.6 million from $25.4 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin decreased from 49.3% in the corresponding period of the prior year to 48.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Gross profit of the Smokeless Products segment was flat at $9.4 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year due to the aforementioned late second quarter trade show and the year ago introductory pipeline volumes on Stoker MST cans. Gross margin for this segment decreased to 49.7% of net sales for the current period from 50.5% in the corresponding period of the prior year due primarily to significant consumer trial incentives associated with the MST expansion and the continuing mix shift to MST products from chewing tobacco.

Gross profit of the Smoking Products segment decreased $0.5 million or 3.7% to $14.4 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year due to timing of the aforementioned cigarette paper shipments and decreased cigar volumes. Gross margin of the Smoking Products segment decreased to 50.1% of net sales for the current period in comparison to 51.2% for the corresponding period in 2015, principally as the result of promotional incentives on the Zig-Zag cigarillo size wraps roll-out.

Gross profit in the NewGen segment decreased $0.2 million or 16.8% to $0.8 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin of the NewGen segment decreased to 24.7% of net sales for the current period in comparison to 27.5% for the corresponding period of the prior year as margins were negatively impacted by higher than normal returned goods associated with the traditional retail trade adjusting their inventory levels to meet reduced consumer demand in those channels.  Trade return rates moderated in both May and June, and through the third quarter have remained steady but elevated relative to historical experience.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $12.7 million compared to $11.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior year, up 7.5% from the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, expense for non-recurring strategic initiatives increased $0.4 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative launch costs were $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million in the corresponding period of the prior year. The third quarter of 2016 included $0.2 of recurring public company costs. We continue to invest and strengthen both our sales and regulatory infrastructures to facilitate future growth.

Interest Expense and Financing Costs  . Interest expense and financing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $5.6 million compared to $8.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in interest expense for 2016 is due to a reduction in outstanding indebtedness.

Investment Income  . Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.3 million. The Company made a change in the investment strategy relating to the MSA account during the second quarter of 2016.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit).    The Company s income tax expense (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 does not bear the normal relationship to income before income taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized.

Net Income  . Due to the factors described above, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.8 million compared with $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

Net Sales  . Company net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $152.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 1.3% from the corresponding period of the prior year. This increase was the result of increases in the Smokeless and Smoking Products segments, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the NewGen Products segment.

Net sales for the Smokeless Products segment for the current period increased $4.1 million or 7.4% to $58.9 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by the ongoing roll-out of MST 1.2oz. cans and by pricing in both chewing tobacco and MST. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, volume increased 1.0% and price/mix accounted for the remainder or 6.4%.

Net sales for the Smoking Products segment increased $1.5 million or 1.9% to $83.4 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Continued growth in our MYO cigar wraps and the roll-out of Zig-Zag cigarillo size wraps contributed to the increase, which was somewhat offset by declining cigar volumes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, volume decreased 1.2% and price/mix increased 3.0%.

Net sales of the NewGen Products segment decreased $3.7 million or 27.0% to $10.0 million in comparison to the corresponding period of the prior year  due both to competitive introductions of new products and to the continuing movement of industry vapor volumes away from traditional retail, where we are positioned with our sales efforts, to vape and accessory shops, where the company is building its sales infrastructure.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,  volume decreased 19.1% and price/mix decreased 7.9%.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the Smokeless Products segment increased to $29.4 million from $27.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.4 million, or 8.9%, principally due to higher sales volume and increased net sales of products with a higher manufacturing cost.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the Smoking Products segment decreased to $41.0 million from $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 0.5%, principally due to lower volumes relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales in the NewGen products segment decreased to $7.8 million from $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 19.0%, principally due to a reduction in sales volume of vaporizers and e-cigarettes.

Gross Profit  . Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $74.1 million from $72.6 million in comparison to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin improved from 48.3% in the corresponding period of the prior year to 48.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Gross profit of the Smokeless Products segment increased 5.9% or $1.7 million to $29.5 million compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin for this segment decreased to 50.0% of net sales for the current period from 50.7% in the corresponding period of the prior year due primarily to significant consumer trial incentives associated with the MST expansion and the continuing mix shift to MST products from chewing tobacco.

Gross profit of the Smoking Products segment increased $1.7 million or 4.3% to $42.4 million when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin of the Smoking Products segment increased to 50.8% of net sales for the current period in comparison to 49.6% for the corresponding period in 2015, principally as the result of favorable mix shifts within the segment, partially offset by cigar wrap promotional incentives.  

Gross profit in the NewGen segment decreased $1.9 million or 45.6% to $2.3 million when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Gross margin of the NewGen segment decreased to 22.4% of net sales for the current period in comparison to 30.1% for the corresponding period of the prior year. Margins for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 were negatively impacted by higher than normal returned goods associated with the traditional retail trade adjusting their inventory levels to meet reduced consumer demand in those channels and a write-off of obsolete inventory.  Trade return rates moderated in both May and June, and through the third quarter remained steady but elevated relative to historical experience.

Interest expense and financing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $20.9 million compared to $25.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in interest expense for 2016 is due to a reduction in outstanding indebtedness.

Income Tax Expense.

Net Income  . Due to the factors described above, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.

In addition, our credit agreements contain financial covenants that use Adjusted EBITDA calculations.

We define  EBITDA  as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes. We define  Adjusted EBITDA  as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, loss on extinguishment of debt, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance.

Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The tables below provide a reconciliation between net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Reserves

Our principal uses for cash are working capital, debt service and capital expenditures. We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility are adequate to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future.

We had working capital of $53.3 million at September 30, 2016 compared to working capital of $42.8 million at December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in inventory and a decrease in accrued liabilities and accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities

The following table sets out the principal components of our cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $0.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $13.1 million, principally due to interest paid on PIK Toggle Notes and an increase in inventory, partially offset by other cash operating results.    We used cash proceeds from the IPO to repay $34 million in accreted value of the outstanding PIK Toggle Notes. A portion of the accreted value that was repaid ($9.9 million) was deemed to relate to pay in kind interest on the PIK Toggle Notes in prior interest periods that was added to the principal balance of the PIK Toggle Notes.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The following table sets out the principal components of our cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

For nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 million compared with net cash used in financing activities of $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $11.0 million, principally due to proceeds from the issuance of stock, partially offset by payments on the first lien term loan, second lien term loan, PIK Toggle Notes and redemption of warrants.

Long-Term Debt

The Company s long-term indebtedness currently consists of our Revolving Credit Facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), First Lien Credit Agreement (the  First Lien Credit Agreement ) and Second Lien Credit Facility (the  Second Lien Credit Agreement ). In connection with the IPO we repurchased and retired all of our outstanding PIK Toggle Notes and 7% Senior Notes for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (see Note 3). As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants in our existing debt instruments. The following table provides outstanding balances under our debt instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Table of Contents 

Revolving Credit Facility

The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate commitments of up to $40 million, subject to a borrowing base, equal to the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (A) the product of 70% multiplied by the value of  eligible inventory  and (B) the product of 85% multiplied by the net recovery percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by the value of eligible inventory, plus (iii) the lesser of (A) the product of 75% multiplied by the value of eligible inventory and (B) the product of 85% multiplied by the net recovery percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by the value of the eligible finished goods inventory, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves established by the administrative agent.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are, at the option of North Atlantic Trading Company, Inc. ( NATC ), the borrower under the facility, equal to the applicable Base Rate or LIBOR Rate plus the applicable Interest Margin, as defined below in the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility matures in January 2019 and there was no outstanding balance at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we have the ability to borrow $30.0 million.

The Company is subject to financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and is required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.10 to 1.00 for each applicable period. The Company is subject to similar negative and affirmative covenants, and events of default as the first lien and second lien term loans described below. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

First Lien Term Loan

On January 13, 2014, we entered into the First Lien Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Administrative Agent for a $170.0 million first lien term loan, which matures on January 13, 2020.

The borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors of this facility (which include all of our subsidiaries other than Turning Point Brands, LLC ( TPLLC ) and its subsidiary), including a pledge of the capital stock of NATC and its subsidiaries held by Holdings, NATC or any Guarantor (other than Holdings), other than certain excluded assets. The aggregate outstanding amounts under the first lien term loan are paid in consecutive quarterly installments on the last business day of each March, June, September and December.

The loans designated as LIBOR rate loans bear interest at the LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 6.50% and the loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at (i) the highest of (A) the Prime Rate, (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (C) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% and (D) 2.25% per year plus (ii) 5.50%. We are required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances including in connection with certain debt issuances by NATC or any of its subsidiaries or in connection with certain asset dispositions. We are permitted to voluntarily prepay the obligations at any time and from time to time without any penalty or premium. The First Lien Credit Agreement requires principal payments of $1.650 million in each of the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and $1.238 million in 2019. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the first lien term loan was 9.0%.

Table of Contents 

The first lien term loan contains certain financial covenants that require NATC to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not be less than 1.25 to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter, and a consolidated total leverage ratio ranging from 6.25 to 1.00 from April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016, decreasing to a ratio of 5.50 to 1.00 from October 1, 2018 to maturity.

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the distribution of dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers, prepayments of other indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and encumbrances, capital expenditures, restricted payments, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The First Lien Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants including, among others, the provision of financial statements, maintenance of property, licenses and insurance. The First Lien Credit Agreement also contains an affirmative covenant requiring us to maintain in effect the Bollor  distribution and license agreements. The First Lien Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-acceleration, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a change of control and judgment defaults. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the outstanding loans may be accelerated and the lenders  commitments may be terminated. The occurrence of the bankruptcy and insolvency event of default will result in the automatic termination of commitments and acceleration of outstanding amounts under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

Second Lien Term Loan

On January 13, 2014, we entered into the Second Lien Credit Facility, with NATC as borrower, between the same parties as the First Lien Credit Agreement for an $80.0 million second lien term loan, which matures on July 13, 2020. The Second Lien Credit Facility is guaranteed by the same guarantors as the First Lien Term Agreement and is secured by a second priority lien over the same collateral.

In connection with the IPO, we prepaid $20 million of the borrowings outstanding under the facility in May 2016.

Under the Second Lien Credit Facility, the loans designated as LIBOR rate loans bear interest at the LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 10.25% and the loans designated as base rate loans bear interest at (i) the highest of (A) the Prime Rate, (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (C) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% and (D) 2.25% per year plus (ii) 9.25%. There is no maximum interest rate other than that permitted by applicable law. We are required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances including in connection with certain debt issuances by NATC or any of its subsidiaries or in connection with certain asset dispositions. We are permitted to voluntarily prepay the obligations without any penalty or premium at any time after the third anniversary of the closing date. For the first three years following the closing date, we must pay a prepayment premium, beginning at 3.0% of the amount being prepaid, refinanced or assigned, which reduces to 2.0% following the first anniversary and to 1.0% following the second anniversary. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate was 11.5%.

We are subject to substantially similar negative and affirmative covenants, and events of default as under the First Lien Credit Agreement. With respect to the financial covenants, we have the same fixed charge coverage ratio requirements, however, NATC is required to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio under the Second Lien Credit Facility ranging from 6.50 to 1.00 from April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016, reducing to a maximum ratio of 5.75 to 1.00 from October 1, 2018 to maturity. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

PIK Toggle Notes and Standard General Warrants

On January 13, 2014, the Company issued the PIK Toggle Notes to Standard General in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million and issued warrants, which were valued at $1.7 million, to purchase 42,424 shares of our common stock at $.01 per share, in connection therewith. After adjustment for the stock split effected prior to the IPO, the warrants provided for the purchase of 442,558 shares of the Company s common stock. The PIK Toggle Notes had an original issue discount of $1.7 million and were initially valued at $43.3 million.

The PIK Toggle Notes accrued interest based on the LIBOR Rate then in effect (but not less than 1.25%) plus 13.75%, reset quarterly. We chose to pay interest in kind for all interest payments for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016 we repurchased all of the outstanding PIK Toggle Notes in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (see Note 3).

Table of Contents 

The 442,558 Standard General Warrants were exercised during the third quarter of 2016 and no warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

7% Senior Notes

In January of 2014, The Company conducted a rights offering to certain of our stockholders that qualified as  accredited investors  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to which the Company issued our 7% Senior Notes to various stockholders, including Standard General and members of management, for a principal amount of $11.0 million and issued the noteholders warrants to purchase 11,000,000 units of membership interests in Intrepid Brands (the  Intrepid Warrants ). The Intrepid Warrants represented 40% of the Intrepid Brands common units outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and are exercisable at a purchase price of $1.00 per unit. As a result of the issuance of the Intrepid Warrants, the 7% Senior Notes had an original issue discount of $2.8 million and were initially valued at $8.2 million.

In connection with the IPO, in May of 2016 we repurchased all of the outstanding 7% Senior Notes in exchange for shares of our common stock and all outstanding Intrepid Warrants for cash (see Note 3).

Credit Line with Standard General

The Company has entered into an agreement with Standard General for a $50.0 million line of credit that we may use to finance acquisitions that are approved by Standard General L.P. in its sole discretion. The line of credit will terminate and all borrowings under the line will mature on May 13, 2021. Borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 6.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. TPB will be the borrower under the facility and none of its present subsidiaries will guarantee the facility.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2016, NATC had no foreign exchange forward contracts.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we executed various forward contracts for the purchase of 11.5 million Euros with maturity dates from May 13, 2015 to July 11, 2016. On December 31, 2015, we had foreign currency contracts to purchase a total amount of 5.1 million Euros.

The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in Euro and US exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations

As of September 30, 2016, there had been no material changes outside the ordinary course to our contractual obligations from December 31, 2015 as reported in our Prospectus dated May 10, 2016 and filed with the SEC.

Inflation

The Company believes that any effect of inflation at current levels will be minimal. Historically, we have been able to increase prices at a rate equal to or greater than that of inflation and believe that we will continue to be able to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have been able to maintain a relatively stable variable cost structure for our products due, in part, to our successful procurement and reformulation activities with regard to our tobacco products and, in part, to our existing contractual agreement for the purchase of our premium cigarette papers.
