1. Description of Business 
    
  Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (the  Company  or  Synchronoss ) is a leading innovator of cloud solutions, software-based activation, secure mobility, identity management and secure messaging for mobile carriers, enterprises, retailers and OEMs across the globe. Synchronoss  software provides innovative service provider and enterprise solutions that drive billions of transactions on a wide range of connected devices across the world s leading networks. The Company s solutions include: activation and provisioning software for devices and services, cloud-based sync, backup, storage and content management capabilities, broadband connectivity solutions, analytics, white label messaging, identity/access management and secure mobility management that enable communications service providers (CSPs), cable operators/multi-services operators (MSOs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with embedded connectivity (e.g. smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile Internet devices (MIDs), such as automobiles, wearables for personal health and wellness, and connected homes), multi-channel retailers, medium and large enterprises and their consumers as well as other customers to accelerate and monetize value-added services for secure and broadband networks and connected devices. 
    
  Synchronoss  Activation Software, Synchronoss Personal Cloud  and Enterprise products and platforms provide end-to-end seamless integration between customer-facing channels/applications, communication services, or devices and  back-office  infrastructure-related systems and processes. The Company s customers rely on the Company s solutions and technology to automate the process of activation and content and settings management for their subscribers  devices while delivering additional communication services. 
    
  The Synchronoss Activation solution navigates the variety of complex back-end systems of CSPs to provide a best-in-class ordering system by orchestrating the workflow and consolidated automated customer care services. This allows CSPs using the Company s platforms to realize the full benefits of their offerings. The platforms also support, among other automated transaction areas, credit card billing, inventory management, and trouble ticketing. In addition to this, the platform supports customer activation related transactions and other services which include managing access service requests, local service requests, local number portability, and directory listings. 
    
  The Synchronoss Personal Cloud  solution seamlessly transfers content from an old device to a new device, syncs, backs up and connects consumer s content from multiple smart devices to the Company s cloud platform. This allows carrier customers to protect and manage their growing cache of personally generated, mobile content over long periods of time. 
    
  The Synchronoss Enterprise solutions support an advanced mobility digital experience for accessing and protecting business and consumer information. The Company s identity and access management platform helps users to securely authenticate access to online websites to conduct e-commerce transactions or access important data. This allows the Company s platforms to help reduce fraud, improve cybersecurity detection/prevention and overall productivity. The identity and access solution supports both consumers by allowing them to self-register and verify their identity, while providing non-intrusive multi-factor authentication and businesses the ability to be sure the correct person is doing the transaction.  The secure mobility platforms help users safely and securely store and share important data. The solutions are based on understanding assumptions on the behaviors of individuals through the capture of who they are, what they are doing and how, where and when they are doing it.  The secure mobility solution combines the identity platform with a  bring your own device  (BYOD) platform that is based on a secure container for accessing data, applications, content and personal information management tools like email, calendar, messaging and notes.

2  .   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes in the Annual Report of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. incorporated by reference in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, variable interest entities (VIE) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary and entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The Company has no unconsolidated subsidiaries or investments accounted for under the equity method. All material intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The results reported in these consolidated financial statements should not necessarily be taken as indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. Certain amounts from the prior year s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. 
    
  For further information about the Company s basis of presentation and consolidation or its significant accounting policies, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Account Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows    ( ASU 2016-15). This new guidance will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the Company would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers,    which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),    which clarifies the guidance in determining revenue recognition as principal versus agent. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,    which provides guidance in accounting for immaterial performance obligations and shipping and handling. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for non-cash consideration and completed contracts at transition. This ASU also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications. The new standards are effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that these ASUs will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the full effect of these standards on its ongoing financial reporting.

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March, 2016, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. While aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments, the amendments may significantly impact net income, earnings per share, and the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.   
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement to estimate and apply a forfeiture rate to reduce stock compensation expense during the vesting period and, instead, account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. As such, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of   $1.0 million   to adjust retained earnings. 
    
  Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments are not reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows. The Company applied the effect of ASU 2016-09 to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, retrospectively. This change increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by   $4.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Under ASU 2016-09, cash paid when withholding shares for tax withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted retrospectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by   $15.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates additional paid in capital ("APIC") pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. This decreased the effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   by   2%   and increased the effective tax rate by   51%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The ASU requires that this change be adopted prospectively. The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by   43,762   shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by   121,041   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized (i.e., through a reduction in income taxes payable) before they can be recognized. Previously unrecognized deferred tax assets were recognized on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of   $0.5 million  . 
    
  Adoption of the new standard impacted previously reported quarterly results as follows:

  SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   UNAUDITED 
  (Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted) 

The Company adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest- Imputation of Interest (subtopic 835-30); Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line of Credit Arrangements, during the first quarter of 2016, concurrently. The adoption of these ASUs required the Company to reclassify its deferred financing costs associated with its Convertible Senior Notes from other assets to long-term debt on a retrospective basis. The Company's consolidated balance sheets included deferred financing costs of   $4.1 million   and   $5.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which were reclassified from other assets to long-term debt. The debt issuance costs associated with the Company's Credit Facility and Amended Credit Facility continue to be presented in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

3. Earnings per Common Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding amounts associated with restricted shares. 
    
  The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had all potentially dilutive common shares been issued. 
    
  Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include stock options, convertible debt and unvested restricted stock. The dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock awards are based on the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the assumed conversion of convertible debt is determined using the if-converted method. The after-tax effect of interest expense related to the convertible securities is added back to net income (loss), and the convertible debt is assumed to have been converted into common shares at the beginning of the period. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per common share.

4. Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities    
    
  The Company classifies marketable securities as available-for-sale.  The fair value hierarchy established in the guidance adopted by the Company prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels as follows: 
             
    Level 1   Observable inputs   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs    other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   includes quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs   includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the Company to develop relevant assumptions. 
       
  The following is a summary of assets, liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interest and their related classifications under the fair value hierarchy:     

(A) 
    Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds. 
              (B) 
    Securities available-for-sale include municipal bonds, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, enhanced income money market fund and corporate bonds which are classified as marketable securities. 
              (C) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was greater than the fair value and accordingly   no   adjustment to the fair value was recorded.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   UNAUDITED 
  (Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted) 

The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. The Company's marketable securities investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities.   No   transfers of assets between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy occurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of investments classified as available for sale, are as follows:  

Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized losses to determine if the losses are other than temporary. The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are temporary. In making this determination, the Company considered the financial condition, credit ratings and near-term prospects of the issuers, the underlying collateral of the investments, and the magnitude of the losses as compared to the cost and the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position. Additionally, while the Company classifies the securities as available-for-sale, the Company does not currently intend to sell such investments and it is more likely than not to recover the carrying value prior to being required to sell such investments.

The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows:  

The unrealized losses and fair values of available-for-sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of   December 31, 2015  , are as follows:  

Expected maturities of available-for-sale securities are as follows:  

Contingent Consideration 
    
  The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Razorsight using a real options approach which uses a risk-adjusted expected growth rate based on assessments of expected growth in revenue, adjusted by an appropriate factor. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s contingent consideration obligation are the probabilities of achieving certain financial targets and contractual milestones. Significant changes in any of those probabilities in isolation may result in a higher (lower) fair value measurement.

The changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 contingent consideration obligation during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:  

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  The Company accounts for the redeemable noncontrolling interest at its fair value as temporary equity, due to the redemption option existing outside the control of the Company. The noncontrolling shareholders have the option, which is embedded in the noncontrolling interest, to require the Company to purchase the remaining noncontrolling share at a formula price designed to approximate fair value based on operating results of the entity. 
    
  The Company recognizes changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest to the greater of the estimated redemption value, which approximates fair value, at the end of each reporting period or the initial carrying amount. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was greater than the fair value and accordingly no adjustment to the fair value was recorded. 
    
  The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was estimated by applying an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value the redeemable noncontrolling interest could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 redeemable noncontrolling interests during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  On February 1, 2012, the Company established a   ten   year Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP  or  the Plan ) for certain eligible employees. The Plan is to be administered by the Company s Board of Directors. The total number of shares available for purchase under the Plan is   500   thousand shares of the Company s Common Stock. Employees participate over a   six   month period through payroll withholdings and may purchase, at the end of the   six   month period, the Company s Common Stock at the lower of   85%   of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or the fair market value on the purchase date. No participant will be granted a right to purchase Common Stock under the Plan if such participant would own more than   5%   of the total combined voting power of the Company. In addition, no participant may purchase more than a thousand shares of Common Stock within any purchase period or with a value greater than   $25 thousand   in any calendar year. 
    
  Treasury Stock 
    
  On February 4, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to   $100 million   of the Company's outstanding Common Stock. Under the program, the Company may purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market, through block trades or otherwise at prices deemed appropriate by the Company. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program will depend on available working capital and other factors as determined by the Board of Directors and management. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   1.3 million   shares have been purchased under the program for an aggregate purchase price of   $40 million  . The Company classifies Common Stock repurchased as Treasury Stock on its balance sheet.

8. Goodwill and Intangibles 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The Company records goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
    
  The changes in goodwill during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows:  

The reclassification adjustment of   $3.0 million   is primarily related to a change in the Company s deferred tax asset in connection with a pre-acquisition tax loss. 
    
  Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Intangible assets consist primarily of trade names, technology, and customer lists and relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on the straight line method over the estimated useful life. Amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015   was   $35.0 million   and   $28.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  The Company s intangible assets consist of the following:

9. Debt 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  In September 2013, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Facility ) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the syndication agent and Capital One, National Association and KeyBank National Association, as co-documentation agents.  The Credit Facility, which was used for general corporate purposes, was a   $100 million   unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on September 27, 2018.  The Company paid a commitment fee in the range of   25   to   35   basis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. Synchronoss had the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility to   $150 million  .  
    
  Interest on the borrowings were based upon LIBOR plus a   2.25   basis point margin. All outstanding balances under the Credit Facility were repaid on July 7, 2016 and the Credit Facility was terminated and replaced with the Amended Credit Facility. 
    
  Amended Credit Facility 
    
  On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the  Administrative Agent ) and the several lenders party thereto (the  Amended Credit Facility ). The Amended Credit Facility, which will be used for general corporate purposes, is a   $250 million   unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on July 7, 2021, subject to terms and conditions set forth therein.  The Company pays a commitment fee in the range of   15   to   30   basis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. Synchronoss has the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Amended Credit Facility to   $350 million  .  
    
  Interest on the borrowing was based upon LIBOR plus a   1.99   basis point margin. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an outstanding balance of   $38 million   on the Amended Credit Facility. 
    
  The Amended Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. 
    
  Interest expense and commitment fees under the Credit Facility and the Amended Credit Facility were as follows: 

Convertible Senior Notes 
    
  On August 12, 2014, the Company issued   $230.0 million   aggregate principal amount of its   0.75%   Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 (the  2019 Notes ). The 2019 Notes mature on August 15, 2019, and bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The Company accounted for the   $230.0 million   face value of the debt as a liability and capitalized approximately   $7.1 million   of financing fees, related to the issuance which are presented net of the face value of the 2019 Notes on the balance sheet.

  SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   UNAUDITED 
  (Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted) 

The 2019 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are convertible into shares of its common stock based on a conversion rate of   18.8072   shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $53.17   per share. The Company will satisfy any conversion of the 2019 Notes with shares of the Company s common stock. The 2019 Notes are convertible at the note holders  option prior to their maturity and if specified corporate transactions occur. The issue price of the 2019 Notes was equal to their face amount. 
    
  Holders of the 2019 Notes who convert their notes in connection with a qualifying fundamental change, as defined in the related indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, following the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require that the Company repurchase some or all of the 2019 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of these conditions existed with respect to the 2019 Notes and as a result, the 2019 Notes are classified as long term. 
    
  The 2019 Notes are the Company s direct senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the liability was   $225.9 million   and the outstanding principal of the 2019 Notes was   $230 million  , with an effective interest rate of approximately   1.39%  . The fair value of the 2019 Notes was   $248.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of the liability of the 2019 Notes was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on current market interest rates available to the Company. These inputs are corroborated by observable market data for similar liabilities and therefore classified within Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy. 
    
  Interest expense for the Company s 2019 Notes related to the contractual interest coupon was: 

10. Restructuring 
    
  In March 2016, the Company initiated the preliminary phase of a work-force reduction as part of a corporate restructuring, with reductions occurring across all levels and departments within the Company. This measure was intended to reduce costs and to align the Company s resources with its key strategic priorities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $0.4 million   of accrued restructuring charges on the balance sheet. 
    
  A summary of the Company s restructuring accrual at   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below:

11. Income Taxes 
    
  The Company recognized approximately   $6.9 million   and   $14.9 million   in related income tax expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately   59%   and   1,143%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates than the U.S. as well as the unfavorable impact of the fair market value adjustment for the Razorsight contingent consideration. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was impacted by the recording of a non-cash income tax provision to establish a   $2.9 million   valuation allowance, which reduced the deferred tax asset related to the current net operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company reviews the expected annual effective income tax rate and makes changes on a quarterly basis as necessary based on certain factors such as changes in forecasted annual operating income, changes to the actual and forecasted permanent book-to-tax differences, and changes resulting from the impact of tax law changes. The early adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   of   2%   and an increase in the effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   51%  . 

12. Legal Matters 
    
  On October 7, 2014, the Company filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (Civ Act. No. 3:14-cv-06220) against F-Secure Corporation and F-Secure, Inc. (collectively,  F-Secure"), claiming that F-Secure has infringed, and continues to infringe, several of the Company s patents. In February 2015, Synchronoss entered into a patent license and settlement agreement with F-Secure Corporation and F-Secure, Inc. whereby the Company granted each of these companies (but not their subsidiaries or affiliates) a limited license to Synchronoss  patents. As a result of entering into the patent license and settlement agreement, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the above complaint. 
    
  The Company s 2011 acquisition agreement with Miyowa SA provided that former shareholders of Miyowa SA would be eligible for earn-out payments, to the extent specified business milestones were achieved following the acquisition. In December 2013, Eurowebfund and Bakamar,   two   former shareholders of Miyowa SA, filed a complaint against the Company in the Commercial Court of Paris, France claiming that they are entitled to certain earn-out payments under the acquisition agreement. The Company was served with a copy of this complaint in January 2014. On December 3, 2015, the Court dismissed all claims in the complaint against the Company. On December 19, 2015, the former shareholders of Miyowa filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal of Paris, France, appealing the Court s decision. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the appeal, or estimate any potential loss if the outcome is adverse, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company believes the positions of Eurowebfund and Bakamar are without merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend all claims brought by them.  
    
  The Company is not currently subject to any legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on its operations; however, it may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently the plaintiff in several patent infringement cases. The defendants in several of these cases have filed counterclaims. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the cases at this time due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company continues to pursue its claims and believes that the counterclaims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend all of such counterclaims.

  Revenues 
    
  We generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per-transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we derived approximately   66%   and   73%  , respectively, of our revenues from transactions processed and subscription arrangements. 
    
  Historically, our revenues have been directly impacted by the number of transactions processed.  The future success of our business depends on the continued growth of consumer and business transactions and, as such, the volume of transactions that we process could fluctuate on a quarterly basis.  See  Current Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations  for certain matters regarding future results of operations. 
    
  Most of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers and increase the extent of recording our international activities in local currencies, we will become subject to currency translation risk that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars. 
    
  Each of AT T and Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . AT T and Verizon in the aggregate accounted for   71%   and   75%   of our revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our agreements with AT T typically run three to five years and cover both a technology fee and exception handling services. We have a Master Services Agreement, with Statements of Work for each of the AT T businesses which we support. Each of our agreements with Verizon typically have a similar duration, subject to a Master Services Agreement, with Statements of Work. See  Risk Factors  for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations. 
    
  Current Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
    
  Growth in our service provider and enterprise solutions are being driven by the massive penetration and use of smart devices on a global basis. The following major trends drive our investment decisions in acquisitions and development of product and solutions: 
    
  Activation.   Service Provider consolidation continues in the US and Internationally. As CSP s merge with MSOs and TV Providers there is an urgency provisioning new subscribers with devices and new value-add service bundles, while driving cost out of the business. Synchronoss Activation is poised to create new efficiencies in often underserved digital channels as a way to quickly provision combined subscriber bases and utilize traditionally underperforming and lower cost digital sales channels.

Personal     Cloud  . Shorter carrier customer contracts and lease programs have resulted in faster device upgrade cycles by customers resulting in increased device order transactions and activations. With mobile devices becoming content rich and acting as a replacement for other traditional devices like PC s, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with others in their community of family, friends and business associates has become an essential need. The major Tier 1 carriers are also publicly discussing achieving 500% penetration (multiple connected devices per user) by enabling connectivity to non-traditional devices. Such devices include connected cars, health and wellness devices, and connected home. The need for these devices to be activated and managed and the contents from them to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our businesses in the long term. Synchronoss Cloud products such as Personal Cloud, Mobile Content Transfer, Backup   Transfer and Out of Box Experience (OOBE) are poised to respond to this trend with white label, secure and scalable products for mobile devices. 
    
  Secure Mobility.   As Enterprise looks to increase productivity, it turns to mobile. Yet it finds itself confronted with the serious logistical challenges of not only managing stringent security requirements, but also accommodating the personal devices of its employees as a lower cost and more employee-friendly option. This trend of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is now prevalent enough that regulated industries are investigating new ways to merge Wall Street level regulated security and privacy with main stream usability standards of Facebook, Twitter, Slacker and other third party mobile services. Inherent in this challenge is managing multi-factor authentication, policy driven credential management and fraud protection as employees move in and out of  work  selves and  Home  selves   or even in, out or between companies. In addition to being able to manage different personas, the ability to create more productive work flows employing predictive analytics is taking on a higher value as a desirable function of a secure mobility platform. Our Secure Mobility platform enables Enterprise to pivot quickly into the regulated BYOD work environment and realize cost savings as well as productivity gains. 
    
  Messaging.   Messaging as a medium is moving beyond standard email. Messaging is fast becoming an interface for commerce. With the emergence of messaging giants such as What s App, Line, Facebook and others, companies are using advanced messaging to create commerce opportunities to give subscribers visibility to smart transactions within a very sticky, high frequency environment. Chat bots, operating on AI fueled from semantic analysis of messaging content are the latest entrants to create a  messaging user interface  that is linking subscribers and third parties together across multiple channels. Service providers are not adopting new messaging clients to compete with highly competitive and viral Over the Top (OTT) players. Instead they are adopting monetization techniques used by those players to extend subscriber information into third party applications and chat interfaces creating stickier commerce opportunities. We are working closely with customers, especially in the Asia Pacific market, to evolve Service Provider messaging into a cloud-centric commerce offering utilizing personal cloud, identity management and other advanced messaging protocols that will open up new revenue streams and allow Operators to compete with OTT providers in new ways. 
    
  To support our expected growth driven by the favorable industry trends mentioned above, we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies, such as the utilization of offshore technical and non-technical resources for our exception handling center management as well as routine software maintenance activities. We also leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth. In addition, we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types. Our cost of services can fluctuate from period to period based upon the level of automation and the on-boarding of new transaction and service types. We are also making investments in new research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers. 
    
  We continue to advance our plans for the expansion of our platforms' footprint with broadband carriers and international mobile carriers to support connected devices and multiple networks through our focus on transaction management and cloud-based services for back up, synchronization and sharing of content. Our initiatives with AT T, Verizon Wireless and other CSPs continue to grow both with our current businesses as well as new products. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates.  If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See  Risk Factors  for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations. 
    
  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations: 

Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue 
                
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
                
    Income Taxes 
                
    Goodwill 
                
    Noncontrolling interest 
                
    Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
                
    Business Combinations 
                
    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  There were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Form 10-K during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
    
  Key Developments 
    
  On March 1, 2016, we acquired all outstanding shares of Openwave Messaging, Inc. for $124.5 million, net of working capital adjustments and liabilities assumed, comprised of $102.5 million paid in cash and $22 million paid in shares of our common stock, based upon the average market value of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the acquisition date. 
    
  Openwave s product portfolio includes its core complete messaging platform optimized for today s most complex messaging requirements worldwide with a particular geographic strength in Asia Pacific. With this acquisition and combined with our current global footprint, we will have increased direct access to subscribers around the world for the Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform and bolster our go-to-market efforts internationally.

Cost of services   increased     $13.8 million   to   $77.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to increases in personnel and related costs, migration and integration of our acquired businesses. Personnel and related costs increased   $5.0 million   due to increased headcount from the Openwave acquisition and the launch of our Enterprise solution. Outside consulting expenses increased   $5.7 million   as a result of increased usage of third party exception handling vendors. Facility costs increased by   $2.3 million   which was primarily driven by increased costs for service contracts due to the expansion of our operational footprint. 
    
  Research and development.    Research and development expense   increased     $4.2 million   to   $28.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to an increase of   $2.9 million   in outside consultant expense which was driven by the launch of our Enterprise solution.

Selling, general and administrative.     Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $10.6 million   to   $31.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase was driven by a   $3.7 million   increase in personnel and related costs which were impacted by increased headcount due to the launch of our Enterprise solution and our Openwave acquisition. There was an increase in professional services of   $1.9 million   related to accounting and legal costs resulting from our acquisitions and tax planning efforts.  The remaining increase related to a   $2.5 million   increase in bad debt expense. 
    
  Net change in contingent consideration obligation  .    The net change in contingent consideration obligation was an   increase   of   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was due to an increase in the probability of achieving the contractual milestones associated with the Razorsight earn-out. There was no contingent consideration balance for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the completion of all prior earn-out periods. 
    
  Restructuring charges.    Restructuring charges were   $1.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , related to employment termination costs as a result of the work force reduction plan started in March 2016 to reduce costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization  .    Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $4.9 million   to   $24.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . This was primarily related to the increase in depreciable assets necessary for the continued expansion of our platforms and amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions.  
    
  Interest income  .    Interest income   decreased     $0.3 million   to   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to a change in our portfolio allocations. 
    
  Interest expense  .    Interest expense   increased     $0.1 million   to   $1.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Other income (expense), net  .  Other income (expense)   increased     $0.9 million   to   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Other income (expense) increased primarily due to a one-time $0.5 million benefit from the restructuring of specific facility leases. 
    
  Income tax.    We recognized approximately   $6.9 million   and   $10.7 million   in related income tax expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately   59%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates than the U.S. and the unfavorable impact of the fair market value adjustment for the contingent consideration obligation related to the Razorsight earn-out. Our effective tax rate was approximately   53%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates than the U.S. and the unfavorable impact of transaction costs related to the purchase of Razorsight, which are required to be capitalized for income tax purposes.

The increase in transaction and subscription revenue is primarily driven by new subscription arrangements as a result of our expansion with new customers.  Professional service and license revenues as a percentage of sales were   31%   or   $145.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   27%   or   $115.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in professional services and license revenue is primarily due to new license agreements and expansion of services with our customers.

  Expenses 
    
  Cost of services.    Cost of services   increased     $45.0 million   to   $217.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to increases in personnel and related costs, migration and integration of our acquired businesses. Personnel and related costs increased   $11.0 million   due to increased headcount from the Openwave acquisition and the launch of our Enterprise solution. Outside consulting expenses increased   $15.3 million  , of which $5.7 million of costs related to the launch of our Enterprise solution and increased usage of our third-party exception handling vendors. Facility costs increased by   $16.3 million   this was primarily driven by increased costs for service contracts due to the expansion of our operational footprint. 
    
  Research and development.    Research and development expense   increased     $9.9 million   to   $78.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to an increase of   $11.1 million   in outside consultant expense which was mostly driven by the launch of our Enterprise solution offset by a   $1.1 million   decrease in personnel and related costs due to the capitalization of qualified software costs.

Selling, general and administrative.    Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $29.2 million   to   $89.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase was driven in part by a   $13.3 million   increase in personnel and related costs which were driven by additional headcount due to the launch of our Enterprise solution and our Openwave acquisition. There was also a   $4.5 million   increase in outside consultants, of which the most significant increase related to costs incurred for the launch of our Enterprise solution. The remaining increases included   $2.5 million   related to facilities and   $3.3 million   related to increases in bad debt expense. 
    
  Net change in contingent consideration obligation.    The net change in contingent consideration obligation was a   $7.3 million     increase   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was due to an increase in the probability of achieving the contractual milestones associated with the Razorsight earn-out. There was no contingent consideration for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the completion of all prior earn-out periods. 
    
  Restructuring charges.    Restructuring charges were   $5.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , related to employment termination costs as a result of the work force reduction plan started in March 2016 to reduce costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $22.8 million   to   $74.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily related to the increase in depreciable assets necessary for the continued expansion of our platforms and amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions. 
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense   increased     $0.8 million   to   $5.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to an increase of approximately $0.8 million related to the drawdown from the Amended Credit Facility. 
    
  Other income (expense), net.    Other income (expense)   increased     $0.4 million   to   $0.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Other income (expense) increased primarily due to a one-time $0.5 million benefit from the restructuring of specific facility leases. 
    
  Income tax.    We recognized approximately   $14.9 million   and   $25.5 million   in related income tax expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately   1,143%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates than the U.S., the unfavorable impact of the fair market value adjustment for the Razorsight contingent consideration obligation and the recording of a non-cash income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance. We considered all available evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income together with new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of our assessment, we recorded a $2.9 million valuation allowance which reduced the deferred tax asset related to our current net operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate was approximately   42%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions We review the expected annual effective income tax rate and make changes on a quarterly basis as necessary based on certain factors such as changes in forecasted annual operating income, changes to the actual and forecasted permanent book-to-tax differences, and changes resulting from the impact of tax law changes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations and borrowings on our Credit Facility. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was   $144.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $89.4 million   as compared to the balance at   December 31, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to our acquisition of Openwave, the unfavorable timing of collections, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of outstanding common stock under the Board approved repurchase program. This was offset by borrowings under the Credit Facility and cash provided by operations. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business through both organic growth as well as possible acquisition activities and the expansion of our customer base.  Uses of cash will also include facility and technology expansion, capital expenditures, and working capital.

At   September 30, 2016  , our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately   $25.0 million   of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries, except those acquired as part of the Openwave acquisition, will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  In September 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Facility ) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the syndication agent and Capital One, National Association and KeyBank National Association, as co-documentation agents.  The Credit Facility, which was used for general corporate purposes, was a   $100 million   unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on September 27, 2018.  We paid a commitment fee in the range of   25   to   35   basis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. We had the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility to   $150 million  .  
    
  Interest on the borrowing were based upon LIBOR plus a   2.25   basis point margin. All outstanding balances under the Credit Facility were repaid on July 7, 2016 and the Credit Facility was terminated and replaced with the Amended Credit Facility. 
    
     Amended Credit Facility 
    
  On July 7, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the  Administrative Agent ) and the several lenders party thereto (the  Amended Credit Facility ). The Amended Credit Facility, which will be used for general corporate purposes, is a   $250 million   unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on July 7, 2021, subject to terms and conditions set forth therein.  We pay a commitment fee in the range of   15   to   30   basis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. We have the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Amended Credit Facility to   $350 million  .  
    
  Interest on the borrowing was based upon LIBOR plus a   1.99   basis point margin. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have an outstanding balance of   $38 million   on our Amended Credit Facility. 
    
  The Amended Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all required covenants. 
    
     Convertible Senior Notes 
    
  On August 12, 2014, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 (the  2019 Notes ). The 2019 Notes mature on August 15, 2019, and bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We accounted for the $230 million face value of the debt as a liability and capitalized approximately $7.1 million of financing fees, related to the issuance. At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the liability was   $225.9 million   and the outstanding principal of the 2019 Notes was $230.0 million, with an effective interest rate of approximately   1.39%  . 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On February 4, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. We plan to make such purchases at prevailing prices over the next 12 to 18 months. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased approximately   1.3 million   shares of our common stock for   $40.0 million   in connection with our existing share repurchase program.

Discussion of Cash Flows 
    
  A summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands): 

Cash flows from operations.   Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $56.5 million  , as compared to   $76.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . Cash flows from operations   decreased   by approximately   $20.1 million   and was primarily impacted by the increased levels of net working capital, specifically, the unfavorable timing of collections. 
    
  Cash flows from investing.    Net cash   used in   investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $80.5 million  , as compared to   $168.7 million     used   for the same period in   2015  . The   decrease   of approximately   $88.2 million   was primarily due to decreased purchases of marketable securities. 
    
  Cash flows from financing.    Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.9 million  , as compared to   $3.1 million     used   by financing activities for the same period in   2015  . The   decrease   in net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $1.1 million   as compared to   2015   was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $38 million offset by share repurchases of $40 million.  
    
  We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our existing operations, our available credit facilities and other available sources of financing will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months based on our current business plans. 
    
  Effect of Inflation 
    
  Although inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Account Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows    ( ASU 2016-15). This new guidance will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Management is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers,    which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),    which clarifies the guidance in determining revenue recognition as principal versus agent. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,    which provides guidance in accounting for immaterial performance obligations and shipping and handling. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition. This ASU also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications. The new standards are effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the effect that these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Management has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of these standards on our ongoing financial reporting.

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March, 2016, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. While aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments, the amendments may significantly impact net income, earnings per share, and the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Management elected to early adopt this standard in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement to estimate and apply a forfeiture rate to reduce stock compensation expense during the vesting period and, instead, account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. As such, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of   $1.0 million   to adjust our retained earnings. 
    
  Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments are not reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows. We applied the effect of ASU 2016-09 to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, retrospectively. This change increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by   $4.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Under ASU 2016-09, cash paid when withholding shares for tax withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted retrospectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by   $15.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates additional paid in capital ("APIC") pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. This decreased our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   by   2%   and increased our effective tax rate by   51%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The ASU requires that this change be adopted prospectively. We excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in our computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increased our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by   43,762   shares and decreased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by   121,041   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized (i.e., through a reduction in income taxes payable) before they can be recognized. Previously unrecognized deferred tax assets were recognized on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our retained earnings of   $0.5 million  . 
    
  Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported quarterly results as follows:

Management adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest- Imputation of Interest (subtopic 835-30); Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associate with Line of Credit Arrangements, during the first quarter of 2016, concurrently. The adoption of these ASUs required us to reclassify the deferred financing costs associated with our Convertible Senior Notes from other assets to long-term debt on a retrospective basis. Our consolidated balance sheets included deferred financing costs of   $4.1 million   and   $5.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which were reclassified from other assets to long-term debt. The debt issuance costs associated with our Credit Facility and Amended Credit Facility continue to be presented in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our interests. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part II,  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. We believe our exposure associated with these market risks has not changed materially since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
    
  We are exposed to translation risk because certain of our foreign operations utilize the local currency as their functional currency and those financial results must be translated into U.S dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the financial statements of foreign businesses into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of financial results between years. 
    
  We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials and services. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our future net sales, cost of sales and expenses and could result in exchange losses. 
    
  We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. A hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at   September 30, 2016   would increase interest income by less than   $0.5 million   on an annual basis. 
    
  Borrowings under our credit facility, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our net income is sensitive to movements in interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities to mitigate interest rate risk. 
    
  Based on our outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016  , a one-percentage point change in interest rates would have affected interest expense on the debt by   $0.4 million   on an annualized basis.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 
    
  On March 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Openwave Messaging, Inc. ( Openwave ). SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business' internal control over financial reporting from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. Accordingly, we have not assessed Openwaves  internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Excluding the Openwave acquisition, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  On October 7, 2014, we filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (Civ Act. No. 3:14-cv-06220) against F-Secure Corporation and F-Secure, Inc. (collectively,  F-Secure"), claiming that F-Secure has infringed, and continues to infringe, several of our patents.  In February 2015, we entered into a patent license and settlement agreement with F-Secure Corporation and F-Secure, Inc. whereby we granted each of these companies (but not their subsidiaries or affiliates) a limited license to our patents. As a result of entering into the patent license and settlement agreement, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the above complaint. 
    
  Our 2011 acquisition agreement with Miyowa SA provided that former shareholders of Miyowa SA would be eligible for earn-out payments to the extent specified business milestones were achieved following the acquisition. In December 2013, Eurowebfund and Bakamar, two former shareholders of Miyowa SA filed a complaint against us in the Commercial Court of Paris, France claiming that they are entitled to certain earn-out payments under the acquisition agreement. We were served with a copy of this complaint in January 2014. On December 3, 2015, the Court dismissed all claims in the complaint against us. On December 19, 2015, the former shareholders of Miyowa filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal of Paris, France, appealing the Court s decision. Although we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal, or estimate any potential loss if the outcome is adverse, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we believe the positions of Eurowebfund and Bakamar are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend all claims brought by them.  
    
  We are not currently subject to any legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our operations; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are currently the plaintiff in several patent infringement cases.  The defendants in several of these cases from time to time may file counterclaims.  Although due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these actions at this time, we continue to pursue our claims and believe that any counterclaims are without merit, and we intend to defend against all such counterclaims. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and our stockholders may lose part or all of their investment.
