Financial Statements   
 Our unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 form part of this
quarterly report. Unless otherwise specified our financial statements are
expressed in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles with the instructions to
Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. 
 Operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2015

1.  
     
       Nature of Operations   

AFC Building Technologies Inc. (the  Company ) was
      incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011.
      Effective January 10, 2014, the Company changed its name from Auto Tool
      Technologies Inc. to AFC Building Technologies Inc. The Company was
      engaged in the sales and distribution of hand tools in Canada.   

On June 30, 2015, the Company decided that continuing the
      operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited ( DSL )
      would no longer be economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by
      the Company were returned to DSL for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015
      the Company no longer held any interest in DSL. The Company determined the
      operations of DSL met the criteria of being reported as a discontinued
      operation. As a result, the Company s historical financial statements have
      been revised to present the operating results of the DSL business as a
      discontinued operation. The results of operations from DSL are presented
      as  Loss from discontinued operations  in the Statements of Operations.
      Unless otherwise noted, the discussion in the notes to these Financial
      Statements relates solely to the Company's continuing operations. The
      Company is in the process of determining a new line of business.   

These financial statements have been prepared on a going
      concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its
      assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The
      continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the
      continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the
      ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
      operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. As at
      June 30, 2015, the Company has not generated any revenues, has a working
      capital deficit of $362,500, and has an accumulated deficit of $297,641
      since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the
      Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed
      financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability
      and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
      liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
      continue as a going concern.   

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation   

The unaudited interim financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
      the United States for interim financial information and with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) instructions for companies
      filing Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim
      financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual
      financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only
      normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial
      position as of June 30, 2015, and the results of operations and cash flows
      for the periods then ended. The financial data and other information
      disclosed in the notes to the interim financial statements related to this
      period are unaudited. The results for the three-month and six-month
      periods ended June 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results
      to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the entire year ending
      December 31, 2015. The unaudited interim financial statements have been
      condensed and certain information and footnote disclosure normally
      included in financial statements in accordance with GAAP have been omitted
      pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations
      and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
      generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
      statements. Therefore, these unaudited interim financial statements should
      be read in conjunction with the Company s annual audited financial
      statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014,
      included in the Company s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2015 with the
      SEC.   

Discontinued Operations   

The results of discontinued operations are presented
      separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all
      periods presented. The expenses included in the results of discontinued
      operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by the disposed
      components that may be reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing
      operations of the Company. The Company disposed of DSL on June 30,
      2015.

      representing cash advances, net of expense reimbursements and accrued
      interest. The amount is unsecured and due on demand. At June 30, 2015, the
      Company owed $8,570 (December 31, 2014 - $7,546) to the President of the
      Company. These were monies advanced by the shareholder for general working
      capital purposes, (i.e. accounting and professional fees) as required. The

      incurred $27,640 (2014 - $32,335) of contractor expenses to the President

      discontinued operations.     

3.  
     
       Discontinued Operations and Deconsolidation of
      Subsidiary   

On June 30, 2015, the Company discontinued the operations
      of its wholly-owned subsidiary DSL. DSL sold hand tools in Canada. All of
      the shares of DSL held by the Company were returned to DSL for
      cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 the Company no longer held any
      interest in DSL. The Company recorded the deconsolidation of the
      subsidiary as an equity transaction, which resulted in a charge of $35,932
      to additional paid in capital. The Company has recognized the separation
      of DSL in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20,
       Discontinued Operations . As such, the historical results of DSL
      have been classified as discontinued operations.   

The Company s historical financial statements have been
      revised to present the operating results of the DSL business as a
      discontinued operation. Assets and liabilities related to the discontinued
      operations of DSL are as follows:

       Licensing Agreement   

On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a license
      agreement with a shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement,
      the Company received an exclusive worldwide license in regards to 15
      domain names related to the automotive e-commerce business for a period of
      40 years. In consideration for the granting of the license, we will pay to
      the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from
      the use of the licensed domains.

       Subsequent Events   

Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to
      ASC Topic 855, and has determined there are no subsequent events to
      disclose other than the following:   

During December 2015, a company controlled by a
      shareholder agreed to forgive $350,305 of amounts owed by the Company. As
      the debt forgiven was owed to a related party, the Company recognized the
      amount forgiven as an equity transaction recorded in additional paid in
      capital.

and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be

 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by
applicable law including the securities laws of the United States, we do not
intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
statements to actual results.  
 Unless otherwise specified our financial statements are
expressed in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles.  
 In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all
dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to
 common shares  refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  
 As used in this quarterly report and unless otherwise
indicated, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  and  our company  mean AFC Building
Technologies Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada,
and our formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company
incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, unless otherwise
indicated.  
  General Overview   
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
May 10, 2011. Our fiscal year end is December 31. Our business offices are
currently located at 101 Mary Street West, Whitby, Ontario, Canada, L1N 2R4. The
address of agent for service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o
National Registered Agents, Inc. of Nevada, 100 East William Street, Suite 204,
Carson City, NV, 89701. Our telephone number is (905) 430-6433.  
  Our Current Business   
 On June 30, 2015, we decided that continuing the operations of
its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited ( DSL ) would no longer be
economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by us were returned to DSL
for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 we no longer held any interest in DSL.
Concurrently with the discontinuation of the DSL operations, we entered into a
license agreement for an exclusive worldwide license in regards to 15 domain
names related to the automotive e-commerce business. In consideration for the
granting of the license, we will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross
sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. Consistent
with our historical operations in this area, we intend to continue to pursue
automotive e-commerce opportunities.  
  Cash Requirements   

Based on our planned expenditures, we will require
approximately $30,000 over the next 12 months. In order to provide funds, we
plan to pursue additional equity financing from private investors or possibly a
registered public offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements
in place for the completion of any further private placement financings and
there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further
private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary
additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our
business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount
of capital resources that are available to us.  
 We have not investigated the availability of commercial loans
or other debt financing to supplement or meet our cash requirements. In the
uncertain event that any such debt financing alternatives were available to us
on acceptable terms, they would increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.  
  Future Financings   
 We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares
and funding from directors and shareholders in order to continue to fund our
business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund
our operations and other activities.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.  
  Results of Continuing Operations   
 The following summary of our results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30,
2015, which are included herein.  
  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014   
 Our operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2015
and June 30, 2014   are summarized as follows:  

Our financial statements report a net loss of $2,243 for the
three month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to a net profit of $17,288 for
the three month period ended June 30, 2014. Our net profit for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 has decreased $19,531 primarily as a result of revenue from
DSL and DSL was disposed of in this last quarter, all of the revenues and
expenses for DSL were reclassified and shown as  Loss from discontinued
operations  on the statement of operations. 
 Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 and 2014 were comparable. The main reason for the slight decrease
in net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2015
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 was a decrease in loss on
foreign exchange.  
  Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014   
 Our operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2015
and June 30, 2014   are summarized as follows:  
 
 Our financial statements report a net loss of $78,980 for the
six month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to a net loss of $6,605 for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2014. Our net loss for the six months ended June
30, 2015 has increased $72,375 primarily as a result of revenue from DSL and DSL
was disposed of in this last quarter, all of the revenues and expenses for DSL
were reclassified and shown as  Loss from discontinued operations  on the
statement of operations.  
 Net loss from continuing operations for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 decreased to $664 from $9,183 during the six months ended June 30,
2014. The main reason for the decrease in net loss from continuing operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30,
2014 was a decrease in selling, marketing and general and administrative
expenses.  
  Liquidity and Financial Condition   
  Working Capital   

Our total current assets as of June 30, 2015 were $246 as
compared to total current assets of $518,426 as of December 31, 2014. The
decrease of $100,090 in working capital was primarily due DSL being disposed of
in this last quarter.  
  Cash Flows   
 
  Operating Activities   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $149,576 in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 compared with net cash used in operating activities
of $75,750 in the six months ended June 30, 2014. This increase was the result
of an increase in net loss.  
  Financing Activities   
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $107,764 in the
six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $32,869 provided by financing
activities in the six months ended June 30, 2014. This increase was the result
of an increase in funds from the Company s line of credit.  
  Going Concern   
 Our consolidated financial statements for the six month period
ended June 30, 2015 have been prepared on a going concern basis and contain an
additional explanatory paragraph which identifies issues that raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.  
 The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent
upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the
ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. As at June
30, 2015, our company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital
deficit of $362,500, and has an accumulated deficit of $297,641 since inception.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our company s ability to
continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies   
 These financial statements and related notes are expressed in
US dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited. All inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company s fiscal year-end is
December 31.

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,

is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal
financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer,

procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief

and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

ADOPTED PURSUANT TO    SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
   
 I, Cindy Lee Kelly, certify that:

      covered by this report;   

3.  
     
       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and

      material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
      flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      report;   

4.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
      responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and

(b)  
     
       Designed such internal control over financial reporting,

       Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
      internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the

      quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
      is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
      control over financial reporting; and     

5.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have

      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

(b)  
     
       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
