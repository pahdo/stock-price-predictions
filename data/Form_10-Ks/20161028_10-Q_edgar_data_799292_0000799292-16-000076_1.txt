  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (the  financial statements ) of M/I Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information.  The financial statements include the accounts of the Company. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  Results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during that period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and have a significant impact on the financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.  With regard to the Company, estimates and assumptions are inherent in calculations relating to valuation of inventory and investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, property and equipment depreciation, valuation of derivative financial instruments, accounts payable on inventory, accruals for costs to complete inventory, accruals for warranty claims, accruals for self-insured general liability claims, litigation, accruals for health care and workers  compensation, accruals for guaranteed or indemnified loans, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, and contingencies.  Items that could have a significant impact on these estimates and assumptions include the risks and uncertainties listed in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in Part I of our   2015   Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC.  
    
  Impact of New Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which provides guidance for revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,  Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.   ASU 2014-09 s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today s guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date  , which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  ASU 2014-09, as amended, is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. 
  Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several ASUs, such as ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  .  These ASUs do not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09. Instead, these amendments are intended to clarify and improve the operability of certain topics addressed by ASU 2014-09.  These additional ASUs will have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09, as amended.  The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption of ASU 2014-09 and these additional ASUs and the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and these additional ASUs will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. See below for additional explanation of each of these additional ASUs. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which makes a number of changes to the current GAAP model, including changes to the accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning  
  
    7 

January 1, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as  lessees  - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.  Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP.  In addition, disclosures of leasing activities will be expanded to include qualitative and specific quantitative information.  For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments   ( ASU 2016-06 ), which requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met. One of those criteria is that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract (the  clearly and closely related  criterion).  ASU 2016-06 clarifies the required steps for assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.  Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. ASU 2016-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ).  The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance stated in ASU 2014-09 on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ).  ASU 2016-10 provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. This update clarifies the guidance in ASU 2014-09 relating to identifying performance obligations and licensing. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ).  ASU 2016-12 provides for amendments to ASU 2014-09 regarding transition, collectability, noncash consideration, and presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes.  Specifically, ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all or substantially all of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.  In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  For public entities, ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will modify the Company's current disclosures and reclassifications within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows but is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

NOTE 2. Inventory and Capitalized Interest 
  Inventory 
  Inventory is recorded at cost, unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land is impaired, at which point the inventory is written down to fair value (see    Note 4    for additional details relating to our procedures for evaluating our inventories for impairment).  Inventory includes the costs of land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes, direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction, and common costs that benefit the entire community, less impairments, if any. 
  A summary of the Company s inventory as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:   

Single-family lots, land and land development costs include raw land that the Company has purchased to develop into lots, costs incurred to develop the raw land into lots, and lots for which development has been completed, but which have not yet been used to start construction of a home. 
  Homes under construction include homes that are in various stages of construction.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   973   homes (with a carrying value of   $179.7 million  ) and   872   homes (with a carrying value of   $184.3 million  ), respectively, included in homes under construction that were not subject to a sales contract. 
  Model homes and furnishings include homes that are under construction or have been completed and are being used as sales models.  The amount also includes the net book value of furnishings included in our model homes.  Depreciation on model home furnishings is recorded using an accelerated method over the estimated useful life of the assets, which is typically three years. 
  Land purchase deposits include both refundable and non-refundable amounts paid to third party sellers relating to the purchase of land.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the land option agreements relating to the land purchase deposits.  In the period during which the Company makes the decision not to proceed with the purchase of land under an agreement, the Company expenses any deposits and accumulated pre-acquisition costs relating to such agreement. 
  Capitalized Interest 
  The Company capitalizes interest during land development and home construction.  Capitalized interest is charged to land and housing costs and expensed as the related inventory is delivered to a third party.  The summary of capitalized interest for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows  :

NOTE 3. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  In order to minimize our investment and risk of land exposure in a single location, we have periodically partnered with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the land investment and development of a property through joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures, and other similar arrangements.  During the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  , we decreased our total investment in such joint venture arrangements by   $10.5 million   from   $37.0 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $26.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which was driven primarily by our   increased   lot distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of   $20.9 million  , offset, in part, by our cash contributions to our unconsolidated joint ventures during the   first nine months of 2016   of   $10.1 million  . 
  We use the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures over which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest.  Under the equity method, our share of the unconsolidated joint ventures  earnings or loss, if any, is included in our consolidated statement of income.  The Company assesses its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability on a quarterly basis.  Refer to    Note 4    for additional details relating to our procedures for evaluating our investments for impairment. 
  For joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established to own the property, we generally enter into limited liability company or similar arrangements ( LLCs ) with the other partners.  The Company s ownership in these LLCs as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   ranged from   25%   to   74%  .  These entities typically engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing or selling developed lots to the Company and its partners in the LLC. 
  We believe that the Company s maximum exposure related to its investment in these joint venture arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   is the amount invested of   $26.5 million  , which is reported as Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, although we expect to invest further amounts in these joint venture arrangements as development of the properties progresses.  Included in the Company s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of capitalized interest and other costs. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  With respect to our investments in these LLCs, we are required, under ASC 810-10,   Consolidation   ( ASC 810 ), to evaluate whether or not such entities should be consolidated into our financial statements.  We initially perform these evaluations when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity.  See Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Variable Interest Entities  in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company s methodology for evaluating entities for consolidation. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have determined that one of the LLCs in which we have an interest meets the requirements of a variable interest entity ( VIE ) due to a lack of equity at risk in the entity.  However, we have determined that we do not have substantive control over that VIE because we do not have the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance.  As a result, we are not required to consolidate the VIE into our financial statements, and we instead record the VIE in Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Land Option Agreements  
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option or purchase agreements  for which we generally pay non-refundable deposits.  Pursuant to these land option agreements, the Company provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. In accordance with ASC 810, we analyze our land option or purchase agreements to determine whether the corresponding land sellers are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary, as further described in Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Land Option Agreements  in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K.  If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our consolidated financial statements and reflect such assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Inventory not Owned in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs from which we are purchasing land under option or purchase agreements. 
   
  NOTE 4. Fair Value Measurements 
  There are three measurement input levels for determining fair value: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.   
  
    10 

Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
  Assets Measured on a Recurring Basis 
  The Company measures both mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ) at fair value.  Fair value measurement results in a better presentation of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them. 
  In the normal course of business, our financial services segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single-family homes with fixed expiration dates.  The commitments become effective when the borrowers  lock-in  a specified interest rate within established time frames.  Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the  lock-in  of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to an investor.  To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, the Company enters into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities to broker/dealers.  The forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments.  The Company does not engage in speculative trading or derivative activities.  Both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to broker/dealers or investors are undesignated derivatives, and accordingly, are marked to fair value through earnings.  Changes in fair value measurements are included in earnings in the accompanying statements of income. 
  The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is estimated based primarily on published prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar characteristics.  To calculate the effects of interest rate movements, the Company utilizes applicable published mortgage-backed security prices, and multiplies the price movement between the rate lock date and the balance sheet date by the notional loan commitment amount.  The Company sells loans on a servicing released or servicing retained basis, and receives servicing compensation.  Thus, the value of the servicing rights included in the fair value measurement is based upon contractual terms with investors and depends on the loan type. The Company applies a fallout rate to IRLCs when measuring the fair value of rate lock commitments.  Fallout is defined as locked loan commitments for which the Company does not close a mortgage loan and is based on management s judgment and company experience. 
  The fair value of the Company s forward sales contracts to broker/dealers solely considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date.  The market price changes are multiplied by the notional amount of the forward sales contracts to measure the fair value. 
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments.    IRLCs are extended to certain home-buying customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria.  Typically, the IRLCs will have a term of less than six months; however, in certain markets, the term could extend to twelve months. 
  Some IRLCs are committed to a specific third party investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the IRLC loan.  Uncommitted IRLCs are considered derivative instruments and are fair value adjusted, with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings.  
  Forward Sales of Mortgage-Backed Securities.    Forward sales of mortgage-backed securities ( FMBSs ) are used to protect uncommitted IRLC loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date.  FMBSs related to uncommitted IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings.  
  Mortgage Loans Held for Sale.      Mortgage loans held for sale consists primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.  Generally, all of the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third-party investors shortly after origination.  During the period between when a loan is closed and when it is sold to an investor, the interest rate risk is covered through the use of a best-efforts contract or by FMBSs.  The FMBSs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings.

Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  Inventory.      The Company assesses inventory for recoverability on a quarterly basis based on the difference in the carrying value of the inventory and its fair value at the time of the evaluation.  Determining the fair value of a community s inventory involves a number of variables, estimates and projections, which are Level 3 measurement inputs.  See Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Inventory  in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company s methodology for determining fair value. 
  The Company uses significant assumptions to evaluate the recoverability of its inventory, such as estimated average selling price, construction and development costs, absorption pace (reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented or to be implemented), selling strategies, alternative land uses (including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned), or discount rates.  Changes in these assumptions could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates and may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future.  Our analysis is conducted only if indicators of a decline in value of our inventory exist, which include, among other things, declines in gross margin on sales contracts in backlog or homes that have been delivered, slower than anticipated absorption pace, declines in average sales price or high incentive offers by management to improve absorptions, declines in margins regarding future land sales, or declines in the value of the land itself as a result of third party appraisals.  If communities are not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company did not record any impairment charges on its inventory. 
  Investment In Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.      We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment on a quarterly basis based on the difference in the investment s carrying value and its fair value at the time of the evaluation.  If the Company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary, the Company would write down the value of the investment to its estimated fair value.  Determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves a number of variables, estimates and assumptions, which are Level 3 measurement inputs. See Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures,  in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company s methodology for determining fair value.  Because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions, it is possible that changes in these assumptions could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates of the investments which may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company did not record any impairment charges on its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  Financial Instruments 
  Counterparty Credit Risk.    To reduce the risk associated with losses that would be recognized if counterparties failed to perform as contracted, the Company limits the entities with whom management can enter into commitments.  This risk of accounting loss  
  
    13 

is the difference between the market rate at the time of non-performance by the counterparty and the rate to which the Company committed.  
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The objective of the fair value measurement is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  

(a) 
    Our senior notes and convertible senior subordinated notes are stated at the principal amount outstanding which does not include the impact of premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest cost over the respective terms of the notes. 
     The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures of financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash.    The carrying amounts of these items approximate fair value because they are short-term by nature.  
  Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, Forward Sales of Mortgage-Backed Securities, Commitments to Extend Real Estate Loans, Best-Efforts Contracts for Committed IRLCs and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017, Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 and Senior Notes due 2021.    The fair value of these financial instruments was determined based upon market quotes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The market quotes used were quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities along with inputs taken from observable market data by correlation.  The inputs were adjusted to account for the condition of the asset or liability. 
  Split Dollar Life Insurance Policy and Notes Receivable.    The estimated fair value was determined by calculating the present value of the amounts based on the estimated timing of receipts using discount rates that incorporate management s estimate of risk associated with the corresponding note receivable. 
  Notes Payable - Homebuilding Operations.    The interest rate available to the Company during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   fluctuated with the Alternate Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate for the Company s   $400 million   unsecured revolving credit facility, dated July 18, 2013, as amended (the  Credit Facility ), and thus the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  Refer to    Note 7    for additional information regarding the Credit Facility. 
  Notes Payable - Financial Services Operations.    M/I Financial, LLC ( M/I Financial ) is a party to two credit agreements: (1) a   $125 million   secured mortgage warehousing agreement, dated   June 24, 2016   (the  MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement  and (2) a   $15 million   mortgage repurchase agreement, as amended and restated on November 3, 2015, as further amended (the  MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility ).  For each of these credit facilities, the interest rate is based on a variable rate index, and thus their carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The interest rate available to M/I Financial during the   third quarter of 2016   fluctuated with LIBOR.  Refer to    Note 7    for additional information regarding the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. 
  
    14 

Notes Payable - Other.    The estimated fair value was determined by calculating the present value of the future cash flows using the Company s current incremental borrowing rate.  
  Letters of Credit.    Letters of credit of   $36.4 million   and   $42.5 million   represent potential commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The letters of credit generally expire within one or two years.  The estimated fair value of letters of credit was determined using fees currently charged for similar agreements. 
   
  NOTE 5. Guarantees and Indemnifications 
  In the ordinary course of business, M/I Financial, a 100%-owned subsidiary of M/I Homes, Inc., enters into agreements that guarantee certain purchasers of its mortgage loans that M/I Financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur, primarily if the mortgagor does not meet the terms of the loan within the first six months after the sale of the loan.  Loans totaling approximately   $20.1 million   and   $12.2 million   were covered under these guarantees as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The   increase   in loans covered by these guarantees from   December 31, 2015   is a result of a change in the mix of investors and their related purchase terms.  A portion of the revenue paid to M/I Financial for providing the guarantees on these loans was deferred at   September 30, 2016  , and will be recognized in income as M/I Financial is released from its obligation under the guarantees.  The risk associated with the guarantees above is offset by the value of the underlying assets. 
  M/I Financial has received inquiries concerning underwriting matters from purchasers of its loans regarding certain loans totaling  approximately   $0.3 million   and   $1.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The risk associated with the guarantees above is offset by the value of the underlying assets. 
  M/I Financial has also guaranteed the collectability of certain loans to third party insurers (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and U.S. Veterans Administration) of those loans for periods ranging from five to thirty years.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total of all loans indemnified to third party insurers relating to the above agreements was   $1.6 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively.  The maximum potential amount of future payments is equal to the outstanding loan value less the value of the underlying asset plus administrative costs incurred related to foreclosure on the loans, should this event occur.  
  The Company recorded a liability relating to the guarantees described above totaling   $0.7 million   and   $1.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is management s best estimate of the Company s liability. 
   
  NOTE 6. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Warranty 
  We use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects, we are, during applicable warranty periods, ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs. As such, we record warranty reserves to cover our exposure to the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors to the extent they relate to warranty-type claims. Warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty reserve for each home closed.  Warranty reserves are recorded for warranties under our Home Builder s Limited Warranty ( HBLW ), and our 30-year (offered on all homes sold after April 25, 1998 and on or before December 1, 2015 in all of our markets except our Texas markets), 15-year (offered on all homes sold after December 1, 2015 in all of our markets except our Texas markets) or 10-year (offered on all homes sold in our Texas markets) transferable structural warranty in Other Liabilities on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
  The warranty reserves for the HBLW are established as a percentage of average sales price and adjusted based on historical payment patterns determined, generally, by geographic area and recent trends.  Factors that are given consideration in determining the HBLW reserves include: (1) the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home; (2) type and mix of amenity packages added to the home; (3) any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring; (4) timing of payments; (5) improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures; and (6) conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects.  Changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty reserve balance at the end of each quarter.  Actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount. 
  Our warranty reserves for our transferable structural warranty programs are established on a per-unit basis.  While the structural warranty reserve is recorded as each house closes, the sufficiency of the structural warranty per unit charge and total reserve is re-evaluated on an annual basis, with the assistance of an actuary, using our own historical data and trends, industry-wide historical data and trends, and other project specific factors.  The reserves are also evaluated quarterly and adjusted if we encounter activity  
  
    15 

that is inconsistent with the historical experience used in the annual analysis.  These reserves are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for products we build, the markets in which we build, claim settlement history, insurance and legal interpretations, among other factors. 
  While we believe that our warranty reserves are sufficient to cover our projected costs, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. 
  A summary of warranty activity for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows: 

(a) 
    Estimated stucco-related claim costs, as described below, have been included in warranty accruals. 
     We have received claims related to stucco installation from homeowners in certain of our communities in our Tampa and Orlando, Florida markets and have been named as a defendant in legal proceedings initiated by certain of such homeowners.  These claims primarily relate to homes built prior to 2014 which have second story elevations with frame construction. 
    
  Through 2015, we repaired certain of the identified homes and accrued for the estimated future cost of repairs for the other identified homes on which repairs had yet to be completed.  The aggregate amounts of such repair costs and accruals were not material, and the reserve for identified homes in need of more than minor repair at December 31, 2015 was   $0.5 million  . During the first half of 2016, we received an increased number of stucco-related claims in our Florida communities, and we recorded additional accruals totaling   $4.9 million   as a change in estimate to our warranty reserves for homes that we identified during this period as requiring more than minor repairs. At June 30, 2016, the remaining reserve was   $2.9 million  , covering the estimated repair costs for the approximately   178   identified homes on which repairs had yet to be completed.  The   $2.9 million   remaining reserve did not include any estimate of the future stucco repair costs for homes for which we had not received claims.  
    
  During the   third quarter of 2016  , we continued to receive stucco-related claims for homes in certain of our Florida communities, identified   199   additional homes that require more than minor stucco repairs and completed repairs on   112   homes. We also continued to review the stucco issues and to collect and analyze information to enable us to reasonably estimate the overall cost of stucco-related repairs to homes in our Florida communities.  During the course of our review, we analyzed a number of factors, including: (1) the date of delivery of each home in our Florida communities and the expiration date of the 10-year statutory period of repose and contractual warranty period with respect to each such home; (2) the number of each type of home (i.e., one story, 1.5 stories or 2 stories); (3) our stucco-related claims experience with respect to each type of home and each individual community; and (4) other relevant factors and observations gained from the field.  
    
  Based on the progress of our review and analysis, we believe that we have accumulated an adequate understanding of, and sufficient experience with, the stucco-related issues to enable us to reasonably estimate the overall cost of stucco-related repairs to homes in our Florida communities.  As a result, during the   third quarter of 2016  , we recorded an additional accrual of   $14.5 million   as a change in estimate to our warranty reserves for the overall cost of stucco-related repairs.  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining reserve for the overall cost of stucco-related repairs was   $15.1 million  .  This remaining reserve represents (1) our estimate of the stucco repair costs for the   265   identified homes in our Florida communities on which repairs have not yet  been completed as of   September 30, 2016   and (2) our estimate of the stucco repair costs for homes in our Florida communities that we have not yet identified as needing repairs but that may require repairs in the future. 
    
  Our review of the stucco-related issues in our Florida communities is ongoing. Our estimate, as of   September 30, 2016  , of our overall stucco repair costs is based on our judgment and various assumptions.  Due to the degree of judgment and the potential for variability in our underlying assumptions, as we obtain additional information, we may revise our estimate, including to reflect additional estimated future stucco repairs costs, which revision could be material. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we also continued our investigation of the extent to which we may be able to recover a portion of our stucco repair and claims handling costs from other sources, including our direct insurers, the subcontractors involved with the construction of the homes and their insurers. As of September 30, 2016, we are unable to estimate an amount, if any, that we  
  
    16 

believe is probable that we will recover from these sources and, accordingly, we have not recorded a receivable for estimated recoveries nor included an estimated amount of recoveries in determining our warranty reserves. 
    
  Performance Bonds and Letters of Credit 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding approximately   $145.8 million   of completion bonds and standby letters of credit, some of which were issued to various local governmental entities that expire at various times through   September 2024  .  Included in this total are: (1)   $102.1 million   of performance and maintenance bonds and   $29.3 million   of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress; (2)   $7.1 million   of financial letters of credit, of which   $5.3 million   represent deposits on land and lot purchase agreements; and (3)   $7.3 million   of financial bonds. 
    
  Land Option Contracts and Other Similar Contracts 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $589.8 million  .  Purchase of properties under these agreements is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the Company and the sellers. 
  Legal Matters           
  In addition to the legal proceedings related to stucco, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in certain other legal proceedings which are incidental to our business.  While management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these other legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, such legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties.  The Company has recorded a liability to provide for the anticipated costs, including legal defense costs, associated with the resolution of these other legal proceedings. However, the possibility exists that the costs to resolve these legal proceedings could differ from the recorded estimates and, therefore, have a material effect on the Company s net income for the periods in which they are resolved.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   reserved for legal expenses, respectively. 

NOTE 7. Debt 
  Notes Payable - Homebuilding 
  The Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment amount of   $400 million  , including a   $125 million   sub-facility for letters of credit. The Credit Facility expires on   October 20, 2018  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , interest on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility was payable at either the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of   175   basis points, or at the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin of   275   basis points. These interest rates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods based on the Company's leverage ratio.  The Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , borrowing availability under the Credit Facility in accordance with the borrowing base calculation was   $536.2 million   and, as a result, the full amount of the   $400 million   facility was available.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $85.0 million   of borrowings outstanding and   $35.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding, leaving net remaining borrowing availability of   $279.5 million  . 
  The Company s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company s subsidiaries, with the exception of subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the business of mortgage financing, title insurance or similar financial businesses relating to the homebuilding and home sales business, certain subsidiaries that are not 100%-owned by the Company or another subsidiary, and other subsidiaries designated by the Company as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in    Note 11   ), subject to limitations on the aggregate amount invested in such Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility and the indenture for the Company s   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Senior Notes ). The guarantors for the Credit Facility (the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ) are the same subsidiaries that guarantee the 2021 Senior Notes, the Company s   $57.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.25%   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the  2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes ) and the Company s   $86.3 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.0%   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the  2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes ).  
  The Company s obligations under the Credit Facility are general, unsecured senior obligations of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and rank equally in right of payment with all our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.  Our obligations under the Credit Facility are effectively subordinated to our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future secured indebtedness with respect to any assets comprising security or collateral for such indebtedness. 
  
    17 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company was a party to   three   secured credit agreements for the issuance of letters of credit outside of the Credit Facility (collectively, the  Letter of Credit Facilities ). During the third quarter of 2016, the Company terminated one Letter of Credit Facility and allowed another Letter of Credit Facility to expire. Therefore, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company was party to   one   remaining Letter of Credit Facility, with a maturity date of   September 30, 2017  , which allows for the issuance of letters of credit up to a total of   $2.0 million  .  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $0.9 million   and   $2.7 million   of outstanding letters of credit in aggregate under the Company s Letter of Credit Facilities, respectively, which were collateralized with   $0.9 million   and   $2.7 million   of the Company s cash, respectively. 
  Notes Payable   Financial Services 
  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial. The Agreement provides a maximum borrowing availability of   $125 million  , which increases to   $150 million   during certain periods with higher expected mortgage origination volume, specifically from September 25, 2016 to October 15, 2016 and from December 15, 2016 to February 2, 2017.  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement expires on   June 23, 2017  .  Interest on amounts borrowed under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is payable at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (1) the floating LIBOR rate plus   250   basis points and (2)   2.75%  .  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement also contains certain financial covenants.  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial was in compliance with all financial covenants of the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.  
  The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial and is structured as a mortgage repurchase facility with a maximum borrowing availability of   $15 million   and an expiration date of   November 1, 2016  .  M/I Financial expects to enter into an amendment to the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility prior to its expiration that would extend its term for an additional year, but M/I Financial can provide no assurances that it will be able to obtain such an extension.  In December 2015, the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility was amended to include a  seasonal increase  provision which increased the maximum borrowing availability to   $20 million   through January 31, 2016.  M/I Financial pays interest on each advance under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility at a per annum rate equal to the floating LIBOR rate plus   250   or   275   basis points depending on the loan type.  The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility also contains certain financial covenants.  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial was in compliance with all financial covenants of the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial s total combined maximum borrowing availability under the two credit facilities was   $165.0 million  , an increase from   $150.0 million   at   December 31, 2015   due to the seasonal increase from September 25, 2016 to October 15, 2016, as described in further detail above.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , M/I Financial had   $91.5 million   and   $123.6 million   outstanding on a combined basis under its credit facilities, respectively, and was in compliance with all financial covenants of those agreements for both periods. 
  Senior Notes    
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $300.0 million   of our 2021 Senior Notes outstanding.  The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of   6.75%   per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year , and mature on January 15, 2021.  The 2021 Senior Notes are general, unsecured senior obligations of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and rank equally in right of payment with all our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The 2021 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future secured indebtedness with respect to any assets comprising security or collateral for such indebtedness.   
  The 2021 Senior Notes contain certain covenants, as more fully described and defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, which limit the ability of the Company and the restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make certain payments, including dividends, or repurchase any shares, in an aggregate amount exceeding our  restricted payments basket  make certain investments; and create or incur certain liens, consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or liquidate or sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions, and covenants under the indenture.  
  The 2021 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantor Subsidiaries.  
  The Company may redeem all or any portion of the 2021 Senior Notes on or after January 15, 2018 at a stated redemption price, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The redemption price will initially be   103.375%   of the principal amount outstanding, but will decline to   101.688%   of the principal amount outstanding if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on January 15, 2019, and will further decline to   100.000%   of the principal amount outstanding if redeemed on or after January 15, 2020, but prior to maturity.

The indenture governing our 2021 Senior Notes limits our ability to pay dividends on, and repurchase, our common shares and our   9.75%   Series A Preferred Shares (the  Series A Preferred Shares ) to the amount of the positive balance in our  restricted payments basket,  as defined in the indenture.  The  restricted payments basket  is equal to   $125.0 million   plus (1)   50%   of our aggregate consolidated net income (or minus   100%   of our aggregate consolidated net loss) from October 1, 2015, excluding income or loss from Unrestricted Subsidiaries, plus (2)   100%   of the net cash proceeds from either contributions to the common equity of the Company after   December 31, 2015   or the sale of qualified equity interests, plus other items and subject to other exceptions.  The restricted payments basket was   $137.7 million   and   $128.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The determination to pay future dividends on, or make future repurchases of, our common shares or Series A Preferred Shares will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and compliance with debt covenants and the terms of our Series A Preferred Shares, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. 
  Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes

The indenture governing the 2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes requires the Company to repurchase the notes (subject to certain exceptions), at a holder s option, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture). 
  The Company may redeem for cash any or all of the 2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes (except for any 2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes that the Company is required to repurchase in connection with a fundamental change), but only if the last reported sale price of the Company s common shares exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for the notes on each of at least 20 applicable trading days.  The 20 trading days do not need to be consecutive, but must occur during a period of 30 consecutive trading days that ends within 10 trading days immediately prior to the date the Company provides the notice of redemption.  The redemption price for the 2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed will equal 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The conversion rate initially equals   42.0159   shares per   $1,000   of principal amount.  This corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately   $23.80   per common share, which equates to approximately   2.4 million   common shares.  The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.  The 2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior subordinated unsecured basis by the Guarantor Subsidiaries.  The 2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes are senior subordinated unsecured obligations of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, are subordinated in right of payment to our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future senior indebtedness and are also effectively subordinated to our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  existing and future secured indebtedness with respect to any assets comprising security or collateral for such indebtedness.  The indenture governing the 2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes provides that we may not redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity date, but also contains provisions requiring the Company to repurchase the 2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at a holder s option, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture).

  In accordance with ASC 280,   Segment Reporting   ( ASC 280 ), we have identified each homebuilding division as an operating segment as each homebuilding division engages in business activities from which it earns revenue, primarily from the sale and construction of single-family attached and detached homes, acquisition and development of land, and the occasional sale of lots to third parties. Our financial services operations generate revenue primarily from the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage loans and title services primarily for purchasers of the Company s homes and are included in our financial services reportable segment.  In accordance with the aggregation criteria defined in ASC 280, we have determined our reportable segments as follows: Midwest homebuilding, Southern homebuilding, Mid-Atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations.  The homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have been aggregated because they share similar aggregation characteristics as prescribed in ASC 280 in the following regards: (1) long-term economic characteristics; (2) historical and expected future long-term gross margin percentages; (3) housing products, production processes and methods of distribution; and (4) geographical proximity.

     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain information included in this report or in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us) contains or may contain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance and financial condition.  Words such as  expects,   anticipates,   targets,   goals,   projects,   intends,   plans,   believes,   seeks,  and  estimates,  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Any forward-looking statements that we make herein and in future reports and statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risk factors.  Please see      Item 1A. Risk Factors  in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ), as the same may be updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC, for more information regarding those risk factors. 
  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date made.

  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  On an ongoing basis, management evaluates such estimates and assumptions and makes adjustments as deemed necessary.  Actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions, or if conditions are significantly different in the future.  See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information about our accounting policies. 
  We believe that there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the   quarter ended September 30, 2016   as compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our   2015   Form 10-K.

  Overview    
  During both the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced generally favorable demand for new homes  in most of our markets as a result of increases in employment, low interest rates, improved consumer confidence, improved mortgage availability and a limited supply of new homes.  While industry-wide new home sales continue at a pace below historical averages, the generally favorable demand for new homes and the continued execution of our strategic business initiatives enabled us to achieve the following results, in comparison to the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  : 
             
    New contracts increased   10%   and   18%  , respectively 
                    
    Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue improved   40   basis points to   12.8%   and   40   basis points to   13.2%  , respectively 
       
  Income before income taxes for the   third quarter of 2016     decreased     30%   from   $26.5 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $18.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  . Income before income taxes for the   third quarter of 2016   was unfavorably impacted by a   $14.5 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ).  This impact to income before income taxes was partially offset by a   $0.2 million     increase   in land sale profit in the   third quarter of 2016   (  $1.1 million  ) compared to the   third quarter of 2015   (  $0.9 million  ).  Excluding the stucco-related charges for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and land sale profits in both periods, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of certain land transactions, adjusted income before income taxes   increased     25%   from   $25.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $31.9 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , income before income taxes   decreased     9%   from   $64.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $58.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Income before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was unfavorably impacted by a   $19.4 million   charge in   2016   for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of  
  
    30 

our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ), and by a   $3.3 million   reduction in land sale profit in   2016's first nine months   (  $3.1 million  ) compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (  $6.4 million  ).  Excluding stucco-related charges for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and land sale profits in both periods , adjusted income before income taxes   increased     29%   from   $57.7 million   in   2015's first nine months   to   $74.4 million   in   2016's first nine months  . The calculation of adjusted income before income taxes, which we believe provides a clearer measure of the ongoing performance of our business, is described and reconciled to income before income taxes, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  
  We believe that our results in both the   third quarter   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were positively impacted by: the generally favorable demand for new homes discussed above; our strategic growth and investment in new communities; continued improvement in our mix of communities and better locations within each of our markets; our continued focus on controlling overall costs; and the strong performance of our financial services operations. 
  Summary of Company Financial Results 
  In the   third quarter of 2016  , we achieved net income to common shareholders of   $9.7 million  , or   $0.35   per diluted share.  This compares to net income to common shareholders of   $14.4 million  , or   $0.51   per diluted share, in   2015's third quarter  .  Net income in each period included   $1.2 million   in dividend payments made to holders of our Series A Preferred Shares. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we achieved net income to common shareholders of   $32.4 million  , or   $1.17   per diluted share.  This compares to net income to common shareholders of   $34.8 million  , or   $1.25   per diluted share, in   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Net income in each period included   $3.7 million   in dividend payments made to holders of our Series A Preferred Shares. 
  During the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded third quarter record total revenue of   $442.5 million  , of which   $419.2 million   was from homes delivered,   $12.7 million   was from land sales and   $10.6 million   was from our financial services operations.  Revenue from homes delivered   increased     21%   in   2016's third quarter   compared to the   same period in 2015   driven primarily by a   15%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  154   units) and a   5%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $16,000   per home delivered).  Revenue from land sales   increased     $5.1 million   from   2015's third quarter   primarily due to strategic land sales in our Mid-Atlantic region compared to prior year (as our homebuilding operations generate revenue from the sale of land in the normal course of operations from time to time).  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded record total revenue of   $1.2 billion  , of which   $1.1 billion   was from homes delivered,   $31.8 million   was from land sales and   $30.6 million   was from our financial services operations.  Revenue from homes delivered   increased     24%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015   driven primarily by a   17%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  436   units) and a   6%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $22,000   per home delivered).  Revenue from land sales   increased     $0.3 million   during   2016's first nine months   primarily due to increased land sales in our Mid-Atlantic region in the current year compared to the prior year.  Revenue in our financial services segment   increased     14%   to   $10.6 million   and   16%   to   $30.6 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the   same periods in 2015   as a result of   increase  s in the number of loan originations,   increase  s in the average loan amount, and more favorable market conditions resulting in higher margins on our loans sold in both periods than we experienced in the prior year. 
  Total gross margin (total revenue less total land and housing costs)   increased     $0.8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   as a result of a   $1.3 million   improvement in the gross margin of our financial services operations offset, in part, by a   $0.5 million     decline   in the gross margin of our homebuilding operations.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered (housing gross margin)   declined     $0.7 million  , due to a   $14.5 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities during the   third quarter of 2016  , partially offset by the   15%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the   5%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered.  Our housing gross margin percentage   declined     360   basis points from   19.6%   in   prior year's third quarter   to   16.0%   in   2016's third quarter  .  Exclusive of the stucco-related charge, our adjusted housing gross margin percentage   declined   slightly by   10   basis points to   19.5%   in the   third quarter of 2016  , largely as a result of product mix and the mix of communities delivering homes, as well as higher construction and lot costs in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   2015's third quarter  .  Our gross margin on land sales   improved     $0.2 million   as a result of increased land sales in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  .  Total gross margin   increased     $19.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of a   $15.0 million     improvement   in the gross margin of our homebuilding operations and a   $4.3 million   improvement in the gross margin of our financial services operations.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   improved     $18.3 million  , due to the   17%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the   6%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered, partially offset by a   $19.4 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities during   2016's first nine months  .  Our housing gross margin percentage   declined     210   basis points from   19.4%   in the prior year to   17.3%   in   2016's first nine months  .  Exclusive of the stucco-related charge, our adjusted housing gross margin percentage   declined     40   basis points to   19.0%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , largely as a result of both a change in product mix and the mix of communities delivering homes, as well as higher  
  
    31 

construction and lot costs in   2016's first nine months   compared to   2015's first nine months  . The calculation of adjusted housing gross margin, which we believe provides a clearer measure of the ongoing performance of our business, is described and reconciled to housing gross margin, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  Our gross margin on land sales   declined     $3.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015   as a result of increased profits on land sales made in the prior year compared to the current year. 
    
  We believe the   increased   sales volume and   higher   sales prices on homes delivered during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   were driven primarily by better pricing leverage in select locations and submarkets and shifts in both product and community mix.  We sell a variety of home types in various communities and markets, each of which yields a different gross margin.  As a result, our housing gross margin may fluctuate up or down from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of communities delivering homes.  The pricing improvements were offset by higher average lot and construction costs related to homebuilding industry conditions and normal supply and demand dynamics which led to the   decline   in our housing gross margin percentage for both the   third quarter   and   first nine months of 2016   as described above.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we were able to pass a portion of the higher construction and lot costs to our homebuyers in the form of higher sales prices.  However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to raise prices. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $8.9 million  , which partially offset the   increase   in our gross margin discussed above, but declined as a percentage of revenue from   13.2%   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   12.8%   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  Selling expense   increased     $3.4 million   from   2015's third quarter   and   improved   as a percentage of revenue to   6.3%   in   2016's third quarter   compared to   6.7%   for the   same period in 2015  .  Variable selling expense for sales commissions contributed   $2.3 million   to the   increase   due to the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered.  The   increase   in selling expense was also attributable to a   $1.1 million     increase   in non-variable selling expense primarily related to costs associated with our sales offices and models as a result of our   increase  d community count.  General and administrative expense   increased     $5.5 million   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to   6.6%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   6.5%   for the   same period in 2015  .  This dollar   increase   was primarily due to a   $3.8 million     increase   in compensation expense due to an increase in employee count as well as higher incentive compensation due to improved operating results, a   $0.5 million     increase   related to start-up costs associated with our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, a   $0.4 million     increase   in land related expenses primarily due to our   increase  d community count, a   $0.3 million     increase   in depreciation expense, and a   $0.3 million     increase   in costs associated with new information systems, and a   $0.2 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $24.1 million  , which partially offset the   increase   in our gross margin discussed above, but declined as a percentage of revenue from   13.6%   in   2015's first nine months   to   13.2%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Selling expense   increased     $10.6 million   from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   improved   as a percentage of revenue to   6.5%   in   2016's first nine months   compared to   6.8%   for the   same period in 2015  .  Variable selling expense for sales commissions contributed   $7.8 million   to the   increase   due to the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered.  The   increase   in selling expense was also attributable to a   $2.8 million     increase   in non-variable selling expense primarily related to costs associated with our sales offices and models as a result of our   increase  d community count.  General and administrative expense   increased     $13.5 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   but   improved   as a percentage of revenue from   6.8%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   6.7%   in   2016's first nine months  .  This dollar   increase   was primarily due to a   $7.3 million     increase   in compensation expense due to an increase in employee count as well as higher incentive compensation due to improved operating results, a   $1.8 million     increase   in land related expenses primarily due to our   increase  d community count, a   $1.0 million     increase   related to start-up costs associated with our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, a   $0.9 million     increase   in depreciation expense, a   $0.7 million     increase   in costs associated with new information systems, a   $0.4 million     increase   in professional fees, a   $0.4 million     increase   in rent expense, a   $0.3 million     increase   in expenses related to mortgage loans sold, and a   $0.7 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  Outlook 
  We believe that U.S. housing markets will continue to experience modest improvement in demand during the remainder of    2016  , as a result of continued positive trends in unemployment, modest wage growth and low interest rates combined with tight inventory levels. We remain focused on increasing our profitability by generating additional revenue and improving overhead operating leverage, continuing to expand our market share, and investing in attractive land and/or new market opportunities. 
  
    32 

We expect to continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives throughout the remainder of   2016  : 
             
    profitably growing our presence in our existing markets, including opening new communities; 
                
    reviewing new markets for investment opportunities; 
                
    maintaining a strong balance sheet; and 
                
    emphasizing customer service, product quality and design, and premier locations. 
     Consistent with these objectives, we took a number of steps during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   for continued improvement in   2016   and beyond, including investing   $147.0 million   in land acquisitions and   $121.8 million   in land development to help grow our presence in our existing markets.  We currently estimate that we will spend approximately   $425 million   to   $450 million   on land purchases and land development in   2016  .  However, land transactions are subject to a number of factors, including our financial condition and market conditions, as well as satisfaction of various conditions related to specific properties.  We will continue to monitor market conditions and our ongoing pace of home sales and deliveries and we will adjust our land spending accordingly.  We opened   34   communities and closed   35   communities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , ending   2016's first nine months   with a total of   174   communities compared to   166   communities at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Going forward, we believe our abilities to leverage our fixed costs, obtain land at desired rates of return, and open and grow our active communities provide our best opportunities for continuing to improve our financial results.  However, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our financial and operating metrics will continue in the future.

The following table shows, by segment: revenue; gross margin; selling, general and administrative expense; operating income (loss); and interest expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(a) 
    Our financial services operational results should be viewed in connection with our homebuilding business as its operations originate loans and provide title services primarily for our homebuying customers, with the exception of a small amount of mortgage refinancing. 
              (b) 
    Includes a   $14.5 million   and   $19.4 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ) taken during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

Reportable Segments 
  The following table presents, by reportable segment, selected operating and financial information as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(a) 
    Includes the effect of total homebuilding selling, general and administrative expense for the region as disclosed in the first table set forth in this  Outlook  section. 
              (b) 
    Includes a   $14.5 million   and   $19.4 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ) taken during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
     
    36 

A home is included in  new contracts  when our standard sales contract is executed.   Homes delivered  represents homes for which the closing of the sale has occurred.   Backlog  represents homes for which the standard sales contract has been executed, but which are not included in homes delivered because closings for these homes have not yet occurred as of the end of the period specified. 
  The composition of our homes delivered, new contracts, net and backlog is constantly changing and may be based on a dissimilar mix of communities between periods as new communities open and existing communities wind down.  Further, home types and individual homes within a community can range significantly in price due to differing square footage, option selections, lot sizes and quality and location of lots.  These variations may result in a lack of meaningful comparability between homes delivered, new contracts, net and backlog due to the changing mix between periods. 
  Cancellation Rates 
  The following table sets forth the cancellation rates for each of our homebuilding segments for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Seasonality 
  Typically, our homebuilding operations experience significant seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels.  In general, homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.  We believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter, as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions.  Our financial services operations also experience seasonality because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This report contains information about our adjusted housing gross margin and adjusted income before income taxes, each of which constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure.  Because adjusted housing gross margin and adjusted income before income taxes are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies in the homebuilding industry and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP.  Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures should be used to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. 
  
    37 

Adjusted Housing Gross Margin and Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes.      Adjusted housing gross margin and adjusted income before income taxes are calculated as follows: 

(a) 
    Represents warranty charges for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ). 
              (b) 
    Represents our profit margin on third-party land sales which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of certain land transactions. 
     We believe adjusted housing gross margin and adjusted income before income taxes are both relevant and useful financial measures to investors in evaluating our operating performance as they measure the gross profit and income before income taxes we generated specifically on our operations during a given period.  These non-GAAP financial measures isolate the impact that the stucco-related charges have on housing gross margins and that the stucco-related charges and gross profits on third-party land sales have on income before income taxes, and allow investors to make comparisons with our competitors that adjust housing gross margins and income before income taxes in a similar manner.  We also believe investors will find adjusted housing gross margin and adjusted income before income taxes relevant and useful because they represent a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of stucco-related charges and fluctuations in third-party land sales which vary in timing.  These financial measures assist us in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix, product pricing and construction pace. 
   
  Year Over Year Comparison 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Midwest Region.   During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Midwest region   increased     $38.8 million  , from   $128.1 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $166.9 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  This   30%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   22%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  80   units) and a   7%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $24,000   per home delivered).  Operating   income   in our Midwest region   increased     $7.1 million  , from   $13.5 million   during the   third quarter of 2015   to   $20.6 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   increase   in operating   income   was primarily the result of an   $10.3 million     increase   in our gross margin, offset, in part, by a   $3.1 million     increase   in selling, general and administrative expense.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   improved     $9.8 million  , due to the   22%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the   7%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered noted above as well as an   improvement   in housing gross margin percentage.  Our housing gross margin percentage   improved     130   basis points to   20.9%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   19.6%   in the prior year s   third quarter  .  Our gross margin on land sales   improved     $0.5 million   as a result of increased profits on land sales made in the current year compared to the prior year. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $3.1 million  , from   $11.7 million   for the   quarter ended September 30, 2015   to   $14.8 million   for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  , but   declined   as a percentage of revenue to   8.9%   compared to   9.1%   for the   same period in 2015  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a   $2.0 million   increase in selling expense due to (1) a   $1.5 million     increase   in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered,   $0.3 million   of which was associated with our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, and (2) a   $0.5 million     increase   in non-variable selling expenses primarily related to costs associated with our sales offices and models in our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division.  The   increase   in  
  
    38 

selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a   $1.1 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a   $0.6 million     increase   in compensation expense, a   $0.3 million   increase related to start-up costs associated with our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, and a   $0.2 million   increase in land related expenses. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced a   19%     increase   in new contracts in our Midwest region, from   341   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   407   in the   third quarter of 2016  , and a   31%     increase   in backlog from   701   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   918   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  The   increase  s in new contracts and backlog were partially due to the addition of   102   homes in backlog from our recent acquisition in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota together with improving sub-market conditions within the region. Average sales price in backlog   increased   to   $388,000   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $378,000   at   September 30, 2015   which was due to higher-end product offerings.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we opened   two   new communities in our Midwest region compared to   six   during   2015's third quarter  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Midwest region   increased   to   2.2   per community in the   third quarter of 2016   from   1.8   per community in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
  Southern Region.      During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Southern region   increased     $6.1 million  , from   $137.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $143.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  This   4%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   9%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  33   units), offset partially by a   1%     decrease   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $3,000   per home delivered) and a   $4.0 million     decrease   in land sale revenue.  Operating income in our Southern region   decreased     $19.1 million   from   $13.9 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to an operating   loss   of   $5.2 million   during the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  .  This operating loss was the result of a   $16.5 million     decline   in our gross margin in addition to a   $2.6 million     increase   in selling, general, and administrative expense.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   declined     $16.2 million  , due primarily to a   $14.5 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities during the   third quarter of 2016   (as more fully discussed in Note 6), partially offset by the   9%     increase   in the number of homes delivered noted above. Our housing gross margin percentage   declined   from   20.8%   in prior year s   third quarter   to   7.9%   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  Exclusive of the stucco-related charge, however, our housing gross margin percentage   decline  d   270   basis points to   18.1%   in   2016's third quarter   largely due to the mix of communities delivering homes and higher construction and lot costs.  The calculation of adjusted housing gross margin, which we believe provides a clearer measure of the ongoing performance of our business, is described and reconciled to housing gross margin, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under  Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  Our gross margin on land sales   declined     $0.3 million   as a result of fewer strategic land sales in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015  . 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $2.6 million   from   $14.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $16.8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   and   increased   as a percentage of revenue to   11.7%   compared to   10.3%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a   $1.0 million     increase   in selling expense primarily due to an   increase   in non-variable selling expenses primarily related to costs associated with our sales offices and models as a result of our   increase  d community count.  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a   $1.6 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a   $1.1 million     increase   in compensation expense, a   $0.2 million     increase   in land related expenses, and   $0.3 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced a   10%     increase   in new contracts in our Southern region, from   399   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   437   for the   third quarter of 2016  , and a   20%     increase   in backlog from   706   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   846   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  The   increase  s in new contracts and backlog were primarily due to improved demand in our Florida markets as well as continued growth in many of our Texas markets.  Average sales price in backlog   decreased  , however, to   $350,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $363,000   at   September 30, 2015   due to a change in product type and market mix. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we opened   six   communities in our Southern region compared to   three   during   2015's third quarter  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Southern region   declined   to   2.0   per community in the   third quarter of 2016   from   2.2   per community in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
  Mid-Atlantic Region.      During the   three month period ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Mid-Atlantic region   increased     $32.8 million   from   $88.9 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $121.7 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  This   37%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   16%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  41   units), a   10%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $33,000   per home delivered), and a   $9.0 million     increase   in land sale revenue compared to prior year due to an increase in strategic land sales throughout the quarter.  Operating   income   in our Mid-Atlantic region   increased     $5.0 million  , from   $6.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $11.4 million   during the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  . This improvement in operating income was primarily the result of a   $5.7 million     increase   in our gross margin, offset, in part, by a   $0.7 million   increase in selling, general and administrative expense.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   improved     $5.7 million  , due to the   16%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the    10%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered noted above in addition to an   improvement   in housing gross margin

percentage. Our housing gross margin percentage   improved   by   140   basis points from   17.7%   in last year s   third quarter   to   19.1%   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  Our gross margin on land sales was flat for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015  . 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $0.7 million   from   $9.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $9.9 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   but   declined   as a percentage of revenue to   8.2%   compared to   10.4%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to a   $0.3 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to an   increase   in incentive compensation related expenses due to improved operating results, in addition to a   $0.4 million     increase   in selling expenses, which was primarily related to an   increase   in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced a   20%     increase   in the number of homes in backlog from   381   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   457   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  Average sales price of homes in backlog also   increased   from   $357,000   at   September 30, 2015   to   $371,000   at   September 30, 2016  . New contracts, however,   decrease  d slightly in our Mid-Atlantic region, from   248   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   244   in the   third quarter of 2016   as a result of the timing of opening of new communities, product mix in the region, and a slower absorption pace.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we opened   three   communities in our Mid-Atlantic region compared to opening   five   during the   third quarter of 2015  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Mid-Atlantic region   declined   to   2.1   per community in the   third quarter of 2016   from   2.4   per community in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
  Financial Services.   Revenue from our mortgage and title operations   increased     $1.3 million   (  14%  ) from   $9.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $10.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   as a result of a   19%     increase   in the number of loan originations, from   713   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   848   in the   third quarter of 2016  , and a   3%     increase   in the average loan amount, from   $286,000   in the   quarter ended September 30, 2015   to   $295,000   in the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  .  We also experienced higher margins on the loans sold. 
  We ended our   third quarter of 2016   with a   $1.1 million     increase   in operating income compared to   2015's third quarter  , which was primarily due to the   increase   in our revenue discussed above, offset, in part, by a   $0.2 million     increase   in selling, general and administrative expense compared to the   third quarter of 2015  , which was attributable primarily to an   increase   in compensation expense. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial provided financing services in all of our markets. Approximately   85%   of our homes delivered during the   third quarter of 2016   were financed through M/I Financial, compared to   80%   in the   same period in 2015  .  Capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  
  Corporate Selling, General and Administrative Expense.    Corporate selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $2.2 million  , from   $8.5 million   for the   third quarter of 2015   to   $10.7 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  . The   increase   was primarily due to a   $1.5 million     increase   in compensation expense related to our improved operating results, as well as a   $0.3 million     increase   in depreciation expense, a   $0.2 million     increase   in costs associated with new information systems, and a   $0.2 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  Interest Expense - Net.    Interest expense for the Company   decreased     $0.1 million  , from   $3.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.6 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   decrease   was primarily the result of a   decline   in our weighted average borrowing rate from   6.03%   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   5.80%   for   third quarter of 2016   which was primarily due to the lower interest rate payable on our senior notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   (  $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Senior Notes )) compared with the interest rate payable on the $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of   8.625%   Senior Notes due 2018 ( 2018 Senior Notes ) that were outstanding during the   third quarter of 2015  .  Partially offsetting this   decrease   was an   increase   in our weighted average borrowings from   $570.0 million   in   2015's third quarter   to   $607.4 million   in   2016's third quarter  .  The   increase   in our weighted average borrowings primarily related to the  increase in the principal amount of our $300.0 million 2021 Senior Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   compared to $230.0 million 2018 Senior Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Earnings from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.    Earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures represent our portion of pre-tax earnings from our joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures and other similar arrangements.  During both the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company earned   less than $0.1 million   in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  Income Taxes.    Our overall effective tax rate was   40.7%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   41.2%   for the   same period in 2015  .  The effective rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to the impact of state  
  
    40 

tax rate changes and lower income before taxes as a result of the   $14.5 million   stucco-related charge taken during the third quarter of 2016 which lowered the estimated impact of annual tax benefits expected for the domestic production activities deduction that were realized during the   third quarter of 2016  . 
   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Midwest Region.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Midwest region   increased     $106.5 million  , from   $331.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $438.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   32%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   21%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  201   units) and a   10%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $34,000   per home delivered), offset partially by a   $0.7 million     decrease   in land sale revenue.  Operating   income   in our Midwest region   increased     $15.4 million  , from   $33.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $48.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   increase   in operating   income   was primarily the result of a   $23.4 million     increase   in our gross margin, offset, in part, by a   $8.0 million     increase   in selling, general, and administrative expense.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   improved     $23.1 million  , due to the   21%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the   10%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered noted above.  Our housing gross margin percentage   improved     50   basis points from   19.5%   in   prior year's first nine months   to   20.0%   for the same period in 2016, but was unfavorably impacted in the   first nine months of 2016   by a   $1.1 million   charge for purchase accounting adjustments from our recent Minneapolis/St. Paul acquisition.  Exclusive of this charge, our housing gross margin percentage   improved     70   basis points to   20.2%   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   19.5%   in last year s   first nine months  .  The calculation of adjusted housing gross margin, which we believe provides a clearer measure of the ongoing performance of our business, is described and reconciled to housing gross margin, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under  Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  Our gross margin on land sales   improved     $0.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015   as a result of increased profits on land sales made in the current year compared to the prior year. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $8.0 million  , from   $31.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $39.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , but   declined   as a percentage of revenue to   8.9%   compared to   9.4%   for the   same period in 2015  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a   $4.8 million     increase   in selling expense due to (1) a   $3.4 million     increase   in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered,   $1.2 million   of which was associated with our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, and (2) a   $1.4 million     increase   in non-variable selling expenses associated with our sales offices and models,   $0.8 million   of which related to our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division.  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a   $3.2 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a   $2.6 million     increase   in compensation expense,   $0.8 million   of which related to our new Minneapolis/St. Paul division, and a   $0.6 million     increase   in land-related expenses. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced a   22%     increase   in new contracts in our Midwest region, from   1,158   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   1,409   in the   first nine months of 2016  , and a   31%     increase   in backlog from   701   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   918   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  The   increase  s in new contracts and backlog were partially due to the addition of   102   homes in backlog from our recent acquisition in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota together with improving sub-market conditions within the region.  Average sales price in backlog   increased   to   $388,000   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $378,000   at   September 30, 2015   which was primarily due to higher-end product offerings.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we opened   six   new communities in our Midwest region compared to   13   during   2015's first nine months  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Midwest region   increased   to   2.3   per community in the   first nine months of 2016   from   2.0   per community in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Southern Region.      During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Southern region   increased     $73.9 million  , from   $341.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $415.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   22%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   20%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  194   units) and a   3%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $11,000   per home delivered), partially offset by a   $3.3 million     decrease   in land sale revenue.  Operating   income   in our Southern region   decreased     $22.0 million   from   $30.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $8.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   decrease   in operating income was the result of a   $13.2 million     decline   in our gross margin in addition to an   $8.8 million     increase   in selling, general, and administrative expense. With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   declined     $11.3 million  , due to a   $19.4 million   charge for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities during   2016's first nine months   (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ), partially offset by the   20%     increase   in the number of homes delivered and the   3%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered noted above.  Our housing gross margin percentage   declined   from   20.2%   in   prior year's first nine months   to   13.5%   for the same period in 2016.  Exclusive of the stucco-related charge, however, our housing gross margin percentage declined 190 basis points to   18.3%   in the   nine months ended  
  
    41 

September 30, 2016   largely due to the mix of communities delivering homes and higher construction and lot costs.  The calculation of adjusted housing gross margin, which we believe provides a clearer measure of the ongoing performance of our business, is described and reconciled to housing gross margin, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under  Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  Our gross margin on land sales   declined     $1.9 million   as a result of fewer strategic land sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015  . 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $8.8 million   from   $38.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $47.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   increased   as a percentage of revenue to   11.4%   compared to   11.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a   $5.0 million     increase   in selling expense due to (1) a   $3.6 million     increase   in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions from the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered, and (2) a   $1.4 million     increase   in non-variable selling expenses primarily related to costs associated with our sales offices and models as a result of our   increase  d community count.  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a   $3.8 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a   $2.2 million      increase   in compensation related expense,   $0.3 million   of which related to our new Sarasota division, a   $0.9 million     increase   in land related expenses, a   $0.3 million     increase   in architectural related expenses, and a   $0.4 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced an   18%     increase   in new contracts in our Southern region, from   1,220   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   1,444   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and a   20%     increase   in backlog from   706   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   846   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  The   increase  s in new contracts and backlog were primarily due to improved demand in our Florida markets as well as continued growth in many of our Texas markets.  Average sales price in backlog   decreased  , however, to   $350,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $363,000   at   September 30, 2015   due to a change in product type and market mix.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we opened   19   communities in our Southern region compared to   18   during   2015's first nine months  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Southern region   declined   slightly to   2.3   per community in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   2.4   per community in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Mid-Atlantic Region.      During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , homebuilding revenue in our Mid-Atlantic region   increased     $34.0 million   from   $250.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $284.5 million   in   2016's first nine months  .  This   14%     increase   in homebuilding revenue was the result of a   6%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered (  $21,000   per home delivered), a   6%     increase   in the number of homes delivered (  41   units), and a   $4.3 million     increase   in land sale revenue compared to prior year.  Operating   income   in our Mid-Atlantic region   increased     $3.4 million  , from   $19.4 million   in   2015's first nine months   to   $22.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   in operating income was primarily the result of a   $4.9 million     increase   in our gross margin, partially offset by a   $1.4 million     increase   in selling, general and administrative expense.  With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered   improved     $6.5 million  , due to the   6%     increase   in the average sales price of homes delivered and the   6%     increase   in the number of homes delivered noted above. Our housing gross margin percentage   improved    by   40   basis points from   18.1%   in   prior year's first nine months   to   18.5%   in   2016's first nine months  .  Our gross margin on land sales, however,   declined     $1.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   same period in 2015   due to lower profits on land sales in the current year compared to the prior year. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $1.4 million   from   $26.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $27.6 million   in   2016's first nine months   but   declined   as a percentage of revenue to   9.7%   compared to   10.4%   for   2015's first nine months  .  The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a   $0.6 million     increase   in selling expense primarily due to an   increase   in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the   higher   average sales price of homes delivered and   higher   number of homes delivered. The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a   $0.8 million     increase   in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to an increase in compensation and land related expenses. 
  During the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  , we experienced a   10%     increase   in new contracts in our Mid-Atlantic region, from   818   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   903   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and a   20%     increase   in the number of homes in backlog from   381   homes at   September 30, 2015   to   457   homes at   September 30, 2016  .  Average sales price of homes in backlog   increased   from   $357,000   at   September 30, 2015   to   $371,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  We opened   nine   communities in our Mid-Atlantic region during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   11   during   2015's first nine months  .  Our monthly absorption rate in our Mid-Atlantic region was   2.6   per community in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the same as in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Financial Services.   Revenue from our mortgage and title operations   increased     $4.3 million   (  16%  ) from   $26.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $30.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a result of a   14%     increase   in  
  
    42 

the number of loan originations, from   1,947   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   2,213   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and a   7%     increase   in the average loan amount from   $276,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $296,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  In addition, we experienced higher margins on our loans sold than we experienced in   2015's first nine months   due to more favorable market conditions during the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  Our financial service operations ended the   first nine months of 2016   with a   $2.2 million     increase   in operating income compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to the   increase   in our revenue discussed above, offset, in part, by a   $2.1 million     increase   in selling, general and administrative expense compared to   2015's first nine months  , which was primarily attributable to a   $1.1 million     increase   in compensation expense, a   $0.4 million     increase   in computer costs related to our investment in new information systems, a   $0.3 million     increase   in expenses related to mortgage loans sold, and a   $0.3 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial provided financing services in all of our markets.  Approximately   84%   of our homes delivered during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were financed through M/I Financial, compared to   80%   in the   same period in 2015  .  Capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  
  Corporate Selling, General and Administrative Expense.    Corporate selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $3.8 million  , from   $23.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $26.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   increase   was primarily due to a   $1.6 million     increase   in compensation expense,   $0.8 million     increase   in depreciation expense, a   $0.3 million     increase   related to costs associated with new information systems, a   $0.2 million     increase   in professional fees, and a   $0.9 million     increase   in other miscellaneous expenses. 
  Interest Expense - Net.    Interest expense for the Company   increased     $1.3 million  , from   $11.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $13.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily the result of an   increase   in our weighted average borrowings from   $535.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $610.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   increase   in our weighted average borrowings primarily related to an increase in borrowings under the Credit Facility during   2016's first nine months   compared to   2015's first nine months  , combined with an increase in the principal amount of senior notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   (  $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   compared to $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2015  ).  Partially offsetting this   increase   was a   decline   in our weighted average borrowing rate from   6.26%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   5.79%   for   2016's first nine months   which was primarily due to the lower interest rate payable on the 2021 Senior Notes compared with the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes that were outstanding during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Earnings from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.    Earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures represent our portion of pre-tax earnings from our joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures and other similar arrangements.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company earned   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million   in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. 
  Income Taxes.    Our overall effective tax rate was   38.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   39.9%   for the   same period in 2015  .  The lower effective rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to the impact of annual tax benefits expected for the domestic production activities deduction and energy tax credits that were realized during   2016's first nine months  .

Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures.      Adjusted housing gross margin for each of our Midwest and Southern regions is calculated as follows: 

(a) 
    Represents purchase accounting adjustments from our recent Minneapolis/St. Paul acquisition. 
              (b) 
    Represents warranty charges for known and estimated future stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities (as more fully discussed in    Note 6   ). 
      
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Overview of Capital Resources and Liquidity. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $23.3 million   of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, with   $22.3 million   of this amount comprised of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, which represents a   $12.1 million     increase   in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from   December 31, 2015  .  Our principal uses of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were investment in land and land development, construction of homes, mortgage loan originations, investment in joint ventures, operating expenses, and short-term working capital and debt service requirements, including the repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities.  In order to fund these uses of cash, we used proceeds from home deliveries and the sale of mortgage loans, as well as excess cash balances, borrowings under our credit facilities, and other sources of liquidity. 
  We are actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to replenish and grow our lot supply and active community count. We expect to continue to expand our business based on the anticipated level of demand for new homes in our markets.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we delivered   3,066   homes, started   3,869   homes, and spent   $147.0 million   on land purchases and   $121.8 million   on land development.  Based upon our business activity levels, market conditions, and opportunities for land in our markets, we currently estimate that we will spend approximately   $425 million   to   $450 million   on land purchases and land development during   2016  , including the   $268.8 million   spent during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   
  We also continue to enter into land option agreements, taking into consideration current and projected market conditions, to secure land for the construction of homes in the future.  Pursuant to these land option agreements, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had purchase agreements to acquire   $589.8 million   of land and lots during the remainder of   2016   through 2028. 
  Land transactions are subject to a number of factors, including our financial condition and market conditions, as well as satisfaction of various conditions related to specific properties.  We will continue to monitor market conditions and our ongoing pace of home deliveries and adjust our land spending accordingly.  
  Operating Cash Flow Activities  .    During the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  , we had   $26.5 million   of cash   provided by   operating activities, compared to   $95.2 million   of cash   used   in operating activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The cash   provided by   operating activities in the   first nine months of 2016   was primarily a result of net income and deferred tax expense totaling   $57.0 million  , along with   $32.5 million   of proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans net of mortgage  
  
    44 

loan originations, and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities totaling   $41.3 million  , offset partially by a   $96.5 million   increase in inventory. The   $95.2 million   of cash   used   in operating activities in the   first nine months of 2015   was primarily a result of a   $203.1 million   increase in inventory, offset by net income and deferred tax expense totaling   $62.0 million  , along with   $16.0 million   of proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans net of mortgage loan originations, and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities totaling   $29.9 million  . 
    
  Investing Cash Flow Activities.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we   used     $19.8 million   of cash in investing activities, compared to   $6.0 million   of cash   used   in investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $13.8 million     increase   in cash   used   was primarily due to a   $9.6 million   increase in property and equipment primarily consisting of our purchase of an airplane during the first quarter of 2016 to assist in efficiency of managing our 15 operating divisions. 
    
  Financing Cash Flow Activities.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we   generated     $5.4 million   of cash from financing activities, compared to   generating     $110.8 million   of cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   $105.4 million     decrease   in cash   generated   by financing activities was due to increased repayments of borrowings under our MIF credit facilities and our Credit Facility (as defined below), as well as decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our ratio of homebuilding debt to capital was   46%   and   45%  , respectively, calculated as the carrying value of our outstanding homebuilding debt divided by the sum of the carrying value of our outstanding homebuilding debt plus shareholders  equity.  The increase compared to   December 31, 2015   was due to a moderately higher amount of homebuilding debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  .  We believe that this ratio provides useful information regarding our financial position, for understanding the leverage employed in our operations and for comparing us with other homebuilders. 
  We fund our operations with cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from home deliveries, land sales and the sale of mortgage loans.  We believe that these sources of cash, along with our balance of unrestricted cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, investment in land and land development, construction of homes, operating expenses, planned capital spending, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.  In addition, we routinely monitor current operational requirements, financial market conditions, and credit relationships and we may choose to seek additional capital by issuing new debt and/or equity securities to strengthen our liquidity or our long-term capital structure.  The financing needs of our homebuilding and financial services operations depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years, inventory levels and related turnover, forecasted land and lot purchases, debt maturity dates, and other factors.  If we seek such additional capital, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and/or increase our interest costs.  
  The Company is a party to three primary credit agreements: (1) a   $400 million   unsecured revolving credit facility dated July 18, 2013, as amended, with M/I Homes, Inc. as borrower and guaranteed by the Company s wholly owned homebuilding subsidiaries (the  Credit Facility  (2) a   $125 million   secured mortgage warehousing agreement, dated   June 24, 2016   (the  MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement ), with M/I Financial as borrower; and (3) a   $15 million   mortgage repurchase agreement with M/I Financial as borrower, dated   November 3, 2015   (the  MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility ). 
  Included in the table below is a summary of our available sources of cash from the Credit Facility, the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of   September 30, 2016  :  

(a) 
    The available amount under the Credit Facility is computed in accordance with the borrowing base calculation, which totaled   $536.2 million   of availability at   September 30, 2016  , such that the full   $400 million   commitment amount of the facility was available, less any borrowings and letters of credit outstanding.  There were   $85.0 million   borrowings and   $35.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , leaving   $279.5 million   available.  The Credit Facility has an expiration date of   October 20, 2018  . 
              (b) 
    The available amount is computed in accordance with the borrowing base calculations under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility, each of which may be increased by pledging additional mortgage collateral.  The maximum aggregate commitment amount of M/I Financial's warehousing agreements as of   September 30, 2016   was   $165 million  .  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement has an expiration date of   June 23, 2017   and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility has an expiration date of   November 1, 2016  .  M/I Financial expects to enter into an amendment to the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility prior to its expiration that would extend its term for an additional year, but M/I Financial can provide no assurances that it will be able to obtain such an extension.

Notes Payable - Homebuilding.     
    
  Homebuilding Credit Facility  .   The Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment amount of   $400 million  , including a   $125 million   sub-facility for letters of credit. The Credit Facility matures on   October 20, 2018  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , interest on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility was payable at either the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of   175   basis points, or at the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin of   275   basis points. These interest rates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods based on the Company s leverage ratio.  
    
  Borrowings under the Credit Facility constitute senior, unsecured indebtedness and availability is subject to, among other things, a borrowing base calculated using various advance rates for different categories of inventory.  The Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants which require, among other things, that the Company maintain (1) a minimum level of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of   $396.0 million   (subject to increase over time based on earnings and proceeds from equity offerings), (2) a leverage ratio not in excess of   60%  , and (3) either a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of   1.5 to 1.0   or a minimum amount of available liquidity.  In addition, the Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the Company s number of unsold housing units and model homes, as well as the amount of Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.  
  The Company s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company s subsidiaries, with the exception of subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the business of mortgage financing, title insurance or similar financial businesses relating to the homebuilding and home sales business, certain subsidiaries that are not 100%-owned by the Company or another subsidiary, and other subsidiaries designated by the Company as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in    Note 11   ), subject to limitations on the aggregate amount invested in such Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  The guarantors for the Credit Facility are the same subsidiaries that guarantee our 2021 Senior Notes, our   $57.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.25%   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the  2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes ), and our   $86.3 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.0%   Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the  2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes ). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility, including financial covenants.  The following table summarizes the most significant restrictive covenant thresholds under the Credit Facility and our compliance with such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Homebuilding Letter of Credit Facilities.    As of June 30, 2016, the Company was a party to three secured credit agreements for the issuance of letters of credit outside of the Credit Facility (collectively, the  Letter of Credit Facilities ).  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company terminated one Letter of Credit Facility, allowed another Letter of Credit Facility to expire by its terms, and extended the maturity date on the remaining Letter of Credit Facility for an additional year to   September 30, 2017   and reduced the amount of the remaining facility from   $5.0 million   to   $2.0 million  .  Under the terms of the remaining Letter of Credit Facility, letters of credit can be issued for maximum terms ranging from one year up to three years.  The Letter of Credit Facility contains a cash collateral requirement of   101%  . Upon maturity or the earlier termination of the Letter of Credit Facility, letters of credit that have been issued under the Letter of Credit Facility remain outstanding with cash collateral in place through the expiration date. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was a total of   $0.9 million   of letters of credit issued under the Letter of Credit Facility, which was collateralized with   $0.9 million   of restricted cash. 
    
  Notes Payable - Financial Services. 
    
  MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.      The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial.  The Agreement provides a maximum borrowing availability of   $125 million  , which  increases to   $150 million   during certain periods with higher expected mortgage origination volume, specifically from September 25, 2016 to October 15, 2016 and from December 15, 2016 to February 2, 2017.  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement expires on   June 23, 2017  .  Interest on amounts borrowed under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is payable at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (1) the floating LIBOR rate plus   250   basis points and (2)   2.75%  . 
  
    46 

The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is secured by certain mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial that are being  warehoused  prior to their sale to investors.  The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement provides for limits with respect to certain loan types that can secure outstanding borrowings.  There are currently no guarantors of the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, although M/I Financial may, at its election, designate from time to time any one or more of M/I Financial s subsidiaries as guarantors. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $77.5 million   outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and M/I Financial was in compliance with all covenants.  The financial covenants, as more fully described and defined in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, are summarized in the following table, which also sets forth M/I Financial s compliance with such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  : 

MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility.    The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial and is structured as a mortgage repurchase facility with a maximum borrowing availability of   $15 million   and an expiration date of   November 1, 2016  .   M/I Financial pays interest on each advance under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility at a per annum rate equal to the floating LIBOR rate plus   250   or   275   basis points depending on the loan type.  The covenants in the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility are substantially similar to the covenants in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.  The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides for limits with respect to certain loan types that can secure outstanding borrowings, which are substantially similar to the restrictions in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.  There are currently no guarantors of the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $13.9 million   outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility.  M/I Financial was in compliance with all financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As is typical for similar credit facilities in the mortgage origination industry, at closing, the expiration of the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility was set at approximately one year and is under consideration for extension annually by the lender.  M/I Financial expects to enter into an amendment to the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility prior to its expiration that would extend its term for an additional year, but M/I Financial cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain such an extension. 
    
  Senior Notes and Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes. 
    
  6.75% Senior Notes.    In December 2015, the Company issued   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   Senior Notes due 2021.  The 2021 Senior Notes contain certain covenants, as more fully described and defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, which limit the ability of the Company and the restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make certain payments, including dividends, or repurchase any shares, in an aggregate amount exceeding our  restricted payments basket  make certain investments; and create or incur certain liens, consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or liquidate or sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions, and covenants under the indenture. 
    
  See    Note 7    for more information regarding the 2021 Senior Notes. 
    
  3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes.    In March 2013, the Company issued $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018.  The conversion rate initially equals 30.9478 shares per $1,000 of their principal amount.  This corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately $32.31 per common share, which equates to approximately 2.7 million common shares.  See    Note 7    for more information regarding the 2018 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes.  
    
  3.25% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes.    In September 2012, the Company issued $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017.  The conversion rate initially equals 42.0159 shares per $1,000 of principal amount.  This corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.80 per common share which equates to approximately 2.4 million common shares.  See    Note 7    for more information regarding the 2017 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes.  

47 

Weighted Average Borrowings.    For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , our weighted average borrowings outstanding were   $607.4 million   and   $570.0 million  , respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of   5.80%   and   6.03%  , respectively.  The   increase   in our weighted average borrowings related to the increase in the principal amount outstanding under our 2021 Senior Notes of   $300.0 million  , compared with   $230.0 million   of 2018 Senior Notes outstanding during the   third quarter of 2015  .  The   decline   in our weighted average borrowing interest rate was also primarily due to the lower interest rate payable on the 2021 Senior Notes compared with the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes that were outstanding during the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $85.0 million   outstanding under the Credit Facility.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average daily amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $102.2 million   and the maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $149.9 million  .  Based on our current anticipated spending on home construction, land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter of 2016, offset by expected cash receipts from home deliveries, we expect to continue to borrow under the Credit Facility during 2016, with an estimated peak amount outstanding of less than   $150 million  .  The actual amount borrowed in the remainder of 2016 (and the peak amount outstanding) and related timing are subject to numerous factors, including the timing and amount of land and house construction expenditures, payroll and other general and administrative expenses, cash receipts from home deliveries, other cash receipts and payments, any capital markets transactions or other additional financings by the Company and any repayments or redemptions of outstanding debt.  The Company may experience significant variation in cash and Credit Facility balances from week to week due to the timing of such receipts and payments. 
  There were   $35.5 million   of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average daily amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $36.9 million   and the maximum amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $39.9 million  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial had   $77.5 million   outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average daily amount outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement was   $47.5 million   and the maximum amount outstanding was   $104.6 million  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , M/I Financial had   $13.9 million   outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average daily amount outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility was   $8.9 million   and the maximum amount outstanding was   $19.0 million  , which occurred during January, while the  seasonal increase  provision was in effect and the maximum borrowing availability was   $20.0 million  . 
  Preferred Shares.    At   September 30, 2016  , we had 2,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000   th    of a Series A Preferred Share, or 2,000 Series A Preferred Shares in the aggregate, outstanding.  The Series A Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference equal to $25 per depositary share (plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) for the then current quarterly dividend period accrued to but excluding the date of final distribution).  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares are non-cumulative and, if declared by us, are paid at an annual rate of 9.75%.  Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears, if declared by us, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15.  If there is a change of control of the Company and if the Company s corporate credit rating is withdrawn or downgraded to a certain level (together constituting a  change of control event ), the dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares will increase to 10.75% per year.  We may redeem the Series A Preferred Shares in whole or in part (provided, that any redemption that would reduce the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Shares below $25 million in the aggregate would be restricted to a redemption in whole only) at any time or from time to time at a cash redemption price equal to $25 per depositary share (plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) for the then current quarterly dividend period accrued to but excluding the redemption date).  Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares have no right to require redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares.  The Series A Preferred Shares have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund provisions, are not convertible into any other securities, and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us.  Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares have no voting rights, except with respect to those specified matters set forth in the Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or as otherwise required by applicable Ohio law, and no preemptive rights.  The outstanding depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol  MHO-PrA.   There is no separate public trading market for the Series A Preferred Shares except as represented by the depositary shares. 
  The indenture governing our 2021 Senior Notes limits our ability to pay dividends on, and repurchase, our common shares and Series A Preferred Shares to the amount of the positive balance in our  restricted payments basket,  as defined in the indenture.  The restricted payments basket was   $137.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We are permitted by the indenture to pay dividends on, and repurchase, our common shares and Series A Preferred Shares to the extent of such positive balance in our restricted payments basket.  We declared and paid a quarterly dividend of $609.375 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares in the   third quarter of 2016 and 2015   for   $1.2 million   and have paid an aggregate dividend payments of   $3.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The determination to pay future dividends on, and make future repurchases of, our common shares  
  
    48 

and Series A Preferred Shares will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and compliance with debt covenants and the terms of our Series A Preferred Shares, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. 
  Universal Shelf Registration.    In October 2013, the Company filed a   $400 million   universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which registration statement became effective on December 20, 2013 and and will expire in December 2016.  Pursuant to the registration statement, the Company may, from time to time, offer debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants to purchase debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares or units of two or more of those securities, rights to purchase debt securities, common shares, preferred shares or depositary shares, stock purchase contracts and units.  The timing and amount of offerings, if any, will depend on market and general business conditions. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
    
  There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations appearing in the Contractual Obligations section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  Notes    3   ,    5    and    6    discuss our off-balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements, and land development joint ventures, including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items.  In addition, these Notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations, including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated. 
  Our off-balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated joint ventures, land option agreements, guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land, and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds.  Our use of these arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the Company.  Additionally, in the ordinary course of its business, our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties. 
  Land Option Agreements.    In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option or purchase agreements  for which we generally pay non-refundable deposits.  Pursuant to these land option agreements, the Company provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. In accordance with ASC 810, we analyze our land option or purchase agreements to determine whether the corresponding land sellers are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.  Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, ASC 810 requires a company to consolidate a VIE if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary.  In cases where we are the primary beneficiary, even though we do not have title to such land, we are required to consolidate these purchase/option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as Consolidated Inventory not Owned in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs from which we are purchasing under land option or purchase agreements. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,  Consolidated Inventory Not Owned  was   $5.9 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the corresponding liability of   $5.9 million   has been classified as Obligation for Consolidated Inventory Not Owned on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Other than the Consolidated Inventory Not Owned balance, the Company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of   September 30, 2016   related to our land option agreements is equal to the amount of the Company s outstanding deposits and prepaid acquisition costs, which totaled   $49.5 million  , including cash deposits of   $33.0 million  , prepaid acquisition costs of   $4.7 million  , letters of credit of   $5.3 million   and   $6.5 million   of other non-cash deposits. 
    
  Letters of Credit and Completion Bonds.    The Company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress, deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding   $145.8 million   of completion bonds and standby letters of credit, some of which were issued to various local governmental entities, that expire at various times through   September 2024  .  Included in this total are: (1)   $102.1 million   of performance and maintenance bonds and   $29.3 million   of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress; (2)   $7.1 million   of financial letters of credit; and (3)   $7.3 million   of financial bonds.  The development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as houses are built and sold.  In locations  
  
    49 

where development has progressed, the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit. 
  Guarantees and Indemnities  .      In the ordinary course of business, M/I Financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that M/I Financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur.  The risks associated with these guarantees are offset by the value of the underlying assets, and the Company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans.  Additionally, the Company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations.  Refer to    Note 5    for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities. 
    
  INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION 
    
  Our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions within the United States and, particularly, by the impact of interest rates and inflation.  Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor can result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes.  In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction.  Higher interest rates also may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them.  The impact of increased rates can be offset, in part, by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates.  In conjunction with our mortgage financing services, hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes.  Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins.  An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices.  Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs.  Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. 
  
    50 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates.  We are exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities, consisting of the Credit Facility, the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility which permit borrowings of up to   $565 million  , subject to availability constraints.  Additionally, M/I Financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services.  
    
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments:    Interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ) are extended to certain home-buying customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria.  Typically, the IRLCs will have a duration of less than six months; however, in certain markets, the duration could extend to twelve months. 
    
  Some IRLCs are committed to a specific third party investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the IRLC loan.  Uncommitted IRLCs are considered derivative instruments and are fair value adjusted, with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings. 
    
  Forward Sales of Mortgage-Backed Securities:    Forward sales of mortgage-backed securities ( FMBSs ) are used to protect uncommitted IRLC loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date.  FMBSs related to uncommitted IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  :    Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.  During the period between when a loan is closed and when it is sold to an investor, the interest rate risk is covered through the use of a best-efforts contract or by FMBSs.  The FMBSs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. 
    
  The table below shows the notional amounts of our financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The table below shows the measurement of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table sets forth the amount of gain (loss) recognized on assets and liabilities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

51 

The following table provides the expected future cash flows and current fair values of borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loan origination services that are subject to market risk as interest rates fluctuate, as of   September 30, 2016  .  Because the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility are effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 30 to 45 days, their outstanding balances are included in the most current period presented.  The interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at   September 30, 2016  .  For fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flow.  Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but do affect our earnings and cash flow.  We do not have the obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity, and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until we are required or elect to refinance it. 

52 

ITEM 4:  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was performed by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer.  Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   quarter ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have received claims from homeowners in certain of our Florida communities (and been named as a defendant in legal proceedings initiated by certain of such homeowners) related to stucco on their homes.  Please refer to    Note 6    of the Company s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these stucco claims. 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in certain other legal proceedings which are incidental to our business.  While management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these other legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, such legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties. The Company has recorded a liability to provide for the anticipated costs, including legal defense costs, associated with the resolution of these other legal proceedings.  However, the possibility exists that the costs to resolve these legal proceedings could differ from the recorded estimates and, therefore, have a material effect on the Company s net income for the periods in which they are resolved. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
  Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if pending or future legal claims against us are not resolved in our favor. 
    
  In addition to the legal proceedings related to stucco discussed below, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in certain other legal proceedings which are incidental to our business. While management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these other legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, such legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties. The Company has recorded a liability to provide for the anticipated costs, including legal defense costs, associated with the resolution of these other legal proceedings. However, the possibility exists that the costs to resolve these legal proceedings could differ from the recorded estimates and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
    
  Similarly, if additional legal proceedings are filed against us in the future, including with respect to stucco installation in our Florida communities, the negative outcome of one or more of such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  Homebuilding is subject to construction defect, product liability and warranty claims that can be significant and costly. 
    
  As a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be significant and costly.  We and many of our subcontractors have general liability, property, workers compensation and other business insurance. This insurance is intended to protect us against  
  
    53 

a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. The availability of insurance for construction defects, and the scope of the coverage, are currently limited and the policies that can be obtained are costly and often include exclusions. We have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly. Also, at times we have waived certain provisions of our customary subcontractor insurance requirements, which increases our and our insurers  exposure to claims and increases the possibility that our insurance will not be adequate to protect us for all the costs we incur. 
    
  We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on a number of factors, including historical experience in our markets, insurance and actuarial assumptions and our judgment with respect to the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these liability reserves, our actual future liability could differ significantly from our reserves. Given the inherent uncertainties, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our construction defect, product liability and warranty claims. If the costs to resolve these claims exceed our estimates, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
    
  We have received claims related to stucco installation from homeowners in certain of our communities in our Tampa and Orlando, Florida markets and have been named as a defendant in legal proceedings initiated by certain of such homeowners.  While we have estimated our overall future stucco repair costs, our review of the stucco-related issues in our Florida communities is ongoing. Our estimate of our overall stucco repair costs is based on our judgment and various assumptions.  Given the inherent uncertainties, we cannot provide assurance that the final costs to resolve these claims will not exceed our accrual and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please refer to    Note 6    of the Company s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these stucco claims. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  (a) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities   None. 
    
  (b) Use of Proceeds   Not Applicable.

 SECOND AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.2 
  EXECUTION 

AMENDMENT NO. 2  TO AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT 
  Amendment No. 2 dated as of August 8, 2016 (this    Amendment   ), between STERLING NATIONAL BANK (the    Buyer   ) and M/I FINANCIAL, LLC (the    Seller   ). 
  RECITALS

 SEVENTH AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT - U.S. BANK

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.3 
    
  SEVENTH AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT 
    
  This Seventh Amended and Restated Master Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into at Columbus, Ohio, as of the 30   th    day of September, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), by and between U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association (the "Bank"), and M/I HOMES, INC., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"). 
    
  1.  Letter of Credit Facility  . 
    
  1.1.      Generally  .  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Bank, upon the proper application by the Company, will issue standby letters of credit in the form of Exhibit "A" attached hereto, or such other form as the Bank may approve from time to time (each, a "Letter of Credit" and collectively,  Letters of Credit ), provided that the aggregate stated value of Letters of Credit issued hereunder and under the Superseded Agreements (as hereinafter defined) outstanding at any one time shall in no event exceed $2,000,000.00 (the "Facility"), and provided, further, that all Letters of Credit issued under this Section 1.1 shall expire not later than thirty-seven (37) months from the date of issuance.  The Company's right to obtain the issuance of Letters of Credit under the Facility shall terminate on September 30, 2017.  
    
  Each request for a Letter of Credit submitted by the Company shall, at the option of the Bank, be accompanied by the following materials (collectively, the "LC Application Materials"): 
    
           a. 
    An application (the "Application") in the form of Exhibit "B" attached hereto and made a part hereof, or such other form as the Bank may require from time to time; 
              b.  
    Cash (the "Cash Collateral") in an amount equal to not less than 101% of the face amount of the applicable Letter of Credit, which the Bank shall deposit in an Account (hereinafter defined); 
              c. 
    Such information as the Bank reasonably requests regarding the intended use of the Letter of Credit; 
              d. 
    Such other documents or materials as the Bank may request from time to time. 
       
  With respect to each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall present the LC Application Materials to the Bank not later than noon, Columbus, Ohio time, on a Business Day that is not less than four (4) Business Days prior to the Business Day on which issuance of the Letter of Credit is desired.  "Business Day" means a day which is not a Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday and on which the Bank is not required by law or other governmental action to close in Ohio.   
    
  Each Letter of Credit issued by the Bank shall be deemed issued subject to the following: 
    
           a. 
    The executed reimbursement agreement (the "Reimbursement Agreement") dated July 27, 2009, and attached hereto as Exhibit "C"; and 

b. 
    The executed security agreement (the "Security Agreement") dated July 27, 2009, and attached hereto as Exhibit "D". 
       
  At the request of the Company, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Bank shall issue Letters of Credit on behalf of one or more Company Subsidiaries (hereinafter defined), provided, however, that the applicable Company Subsidiary(ies) and the Company shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Reimbursement Agreement, and the other Loan Documents. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything in the Reimbursement Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any provision of this Agreement or the Security Agreement is inconsistent with the Reimbursement Agreement, the terms of this Agreement and the Security Agreement shall prevail.  Specifically, without limitation: (i) the security interest granted by the Company to the Bank pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement shall be limited to the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement), and the Bank shall not file any financing statement that contains a collateral description that is broader than such definition of Collateral, and (ii) except for the Collateral and the Cash Collateral, as to which the Bank s rights shall include all rights contained in this Agreement, the Reimbursement Agreement and the Security Agreement, the Bank shall not set off or apply any deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held or other indebtedness at any time owing by Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Company. 
    
  1.2      Account(s)  .  The Bank shall deposit the Cash Collateral in one or more accounts at the Bank specified in the Security Agreement (each, an "Account").  Each Account shall be an interest bearing account (unless the Company requests a non-interest bearing account) satisfactory to the Bank, including as of the Effective Date, without limitation, money market accounts and commercial paper open accounts.  The Cash Collateral applicable to a given Letter of Credit shall be held in the Account until the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a draw pursuant to the Letter of Credit, or (b) the expiration of the Letter of Credit.  Upon the expiration of a Letter of Credit, provided that no draws have been made upon such Letter of Credit, Bank shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the Cash Collateral together with any interest earned thereon. 
    
  1.3      Letter of Credit Draws  .  In the event that the Bank pays any sum (a "LC Draw Amount") drawn by the beneficiary of an outstanding Letter of Credit (a "LC Draw"), interest shall immediately start to accrue on the LC Draw Amount at the Adjusted One Month LIBOR Rate (hereinafter defined), and such interest shall continue to accrue until reimbursement in full to the Bank.  In the event that the LC Draw Amount (together with accrued interest) has not been repaid to Bank within ten (10) Business Days, then the Bank may, without further notice to the Company and at Bank s sole option, reimburse itself from the Account applicable to the Letter of Credit.  In the event that the funds contained in the Account are not sufficient to reimburse the Bank for the LC Draw Amount plus accrued interest, the Bank shall have the right to declare any remaining funds due and payable by written notice to the Company.  Such funds shall continue to bear interest at the Adjusted One Month LIBOR Rate until fully repaid by the Company. 
    
  2.      Interest Rate; Fees  . 

2.1.      Adjusted One Month LIBOR Rate  .  As used herein, "Adjusted One Month LIBOR Rate" shall mean an annual rate equal to two and one-half percent (2.50%) plus the greater of:  (a) the One-Month LIBOR Rate, or (b) one and one-half percent (1.50%).  "One Month LIBOR Rate" shall mean the one-month LIBOR rate quoted by the Bank from Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page or any successor thereto, which shall be that one-month LIBOR rate in effect two New York Banking Days prior to the Reprice Date, adjusted for any reserve requirement and any subsequent costs arising from a change in government regulation, such rate rounded up to the nearest one-sixteenth percent and such rate to be reset monthly on each Reprice Date.  The term "New York Banking Day"     means any date (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which commercial banks are open for business in New York, New York.  The term "Reprice Date" means the first day of each month.  If an LC Draw occurs other than on the Reprice Date, the initial one-month LIBOR rate shall be that one-month LIBOR rate in effect two New York Banking Days prior to the date of the LC Draw, which rate plus the percentage described above shall be in effect until the next Reprice Date.  Lender s internal records of applicable interest rates shall be determinative in the absence of manifest error.  
    
  2.2.      Fees, Costs, Expenses  .  In consideration of the issuance of each Letter of Credit, the Company agrees to pay to the Bank, for the sole benefit of the Bank, Bank's customary letter of credit negotiation and documentation fees (which fees shall not exceed $500.00 for each Letter of Credit), all such fees being due and payable at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit.   
    
  With respect to the period through September 30, 2016, the Company also agrees to pay to the Bank a fee (which shall accrue on a daily basis, but be due and payable quarterly in arrears upon the issuance of a statement to the Company by the Bank) equal to the sum of (a) an amount equal to an annualized rate of one and one-half percent (1.50%) on the daily outstanding balance of all Letters of Credit pursuant to the Facility during such calendar quarter; and (b) an amount equal to an annualized rate of one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) on the daily unused portion of the Facility during such calendar quarter (i.e., $4,000,000.00 minus the daily outstanding balance of all Letters of Credit pursuant to the Facility).   
    
  With respect to the period after September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2017, the Company also agrees to pay to the Bank a fee (which shall accrue on a daily basis, but be due and payable quarterly in arrears upon the issuance of a statement to the Company by the Bank) equal to the sum of (a) an amount equal to an annualized rate of one and one-half percent (1.50%) on the daily outstanding balance of all Letters of Credit pursuant to the Facility during such calendar quarter; and (b) an amount equal to an annualized rate of one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) on the daily unused portion of the Facility during such calendar quarter (i.e., $2,000,000.00 minus the daily outstanding balance of all Letters of Credit pursuant to the Facility).   
    
  With respect to the period following September 30, 2017, the Company shall, in addition, pay to the Bank a variable fee (which shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears upon the issuance of a statement to the Company by the Bank) equal to an annualized rate of one and one-half percent (1.50%) on the average daily outstanding balance of all Letters of Credit pursuant to the Facility 

during such calendar quarter; such quarterly payments shall continue until a quarter occurs when there are no such outstanding Letters of Credit. 
    
  Additionally, the Company agrees to pay on demand by the Bank all other reasonable and actual costs and expenses incidental to or incurred in connection with (a) the Facility and the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined), and any subsequent amendments or modifications thereof, (b) the enforcement of the rights of the Bank in connection therewith, and (c) any litigation, contest, dispute, proceeding or action in any way relating to the Collateral (as hereinafter defined), this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, whether any of the foregoing are incurred prior to or after maturity, the occurrence of an Event of Default, or the rendering of a judgment.  Such costs and expenses shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Bank.  All indebtedness, debts and liabilities, including, without limitation, principal, interest, indemnification obligations, prepayment fees, late charges, collection costs, attorneys' fees and expenses, of the Company to the Bank arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents are hereafter referred to collectively as the "Obligations.") 
    
  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in Section 6.1, the payment of any fees, costs and expenses set forth in this Section 2.2 may be charged (via automatic debit) by the Bank to any Account. 
    
  All fees shall be fully earned by the Bank, as applicable, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Agreement on the due date thereof and, except as otherwise set forth herein or required by applicable law, shall not be subject to rebate, refund or proration.  All fees provided for in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to be for compensation for services and are not, and shall not be deemed to be, interest or any other charge for the use, forbearance or detention of money. 
    
  2.3       Letter of Credit Reserves  .  If any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any court or other governmental authority charged with the administration thereof shall either (a) impose, modify, deem or make applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment or similar requirements against Letters of Credit issued by the Bank, or (b) impose on the Bank any other condition regarding this Agreement or the Facility, and the result of any event referred to in clause (a) or (b) above shall be to increase the cost to the Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or the Facility (which increase in cost shall be the result of the Bank's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Bank, the Company shall immediately pay to the Bank additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Bank for such increased cost, together with interest on each such amount from the date demanded until payment in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Daily LIBOR Rate. A certificate as to such increased cost incurred by the Bank, submitted by the Bank to the Company, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amount thereof.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until there is no existing or future obligation of the Bank under any Letter of Credit.   
    
  2.4      Further Assurances  .  The Company hereby agrees to do and perform any and all acts and to execute any and all further instruments reasonably requested by the Bank more fully to effect 

the purposes of this Agreement and the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder, and further agrees to execute any and all instruments reasonably requested by the Bank in connection with the obtaining and/or maintaining of any insurance coverage applicable to any Letter of Credit.

  3.2.      Borrowing is Legal and Authorized  .  (a) The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has duly authorized the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and the Loan Documents constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally; and (b) the execution of the Loan Documents and the compliance by the Company with the applicable provisions thereof (i) are within the corporate powers of the Company, and (ii) are legal and will not conflict with, result in any breach in any of the provisions of, constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any lien or encumbrance upon any property of the Company under the provisions of, any agreement, charter instrument, bylaw or other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.   
    
  3.3.      Taxes  .  All tax returns required to be filed by the Company in any jurisdiction have in fact been filed, and all taxes, estimated payments, assessments, fees and other governmental charges or levies upon the Company, or upon any of its property or assets or in respect of its franchises, businesses or income, which are due and payable have been paid, except those (a) contested in good faith by the Company, by appropriate proceedings diligently instituted and conducted, and (b) with respect to which any reserve or other appropriate provision, as shall be required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), shall have been made therefor.

3.4.      Compliance with Law  .  The Company is not in violation of any laws, ordinances, governmental rules or regulations to which it is subject, except to the extent that such a violation or failure does not have or is not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
    
  3.5.      Litigation; Adverse Effects  .  There is no action, suit, audit, proceeding, administrative proceeding, investigation or arbitration (or series of related actions, suits, audits, proceedings, investigations or arbitrations) before or by any governmental authority or private arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any property of the Company challenging the validity or the enforceability of any of the Loan Documents, or which, if adversely determined, shall have or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company is not subject to or in default with respect to any final judgment, writ, injunction, restraining order or order of any nature, decree, rule or regulation of any court or governmental authority, in each case which shall have or is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   
    
  3.6.      No Insolvency  .  On the date of this Agreement and after giving effect to all indebtedness of the Company, the Company (a) will be able to pay its obligations as they become due and payable; (b) has assets, the present fair saleable value of which exceeds the amount that will be required to pay its probable liability on its obligations as the same become absolute and matured; (c) has sufficient property, the sum of which at a fair valuation exceeds all of the Company's indebtedness; and (d) will have sufficient capital to engage in its business.  The determination of the foregoing for the Company takes into account all of the Company's properties and liabilities, regardless of whether, or the amount at which, any such property or liability is included on a balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, including property such as contingent contribution or subrogation rights, business prospects and goodwill.  The determination of the sum of the Company's properties at the present fair salable value has been made on a going concern basis. 
    
  3.7.      Government Consent  .  Neither the nature of the Company or of its business or properties, nor any relationship between the Company and any other entity or person, nor any circumstance in connection with the execution of this Agreement, is such as to require a consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental authority on the part of the Company as a condition to the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents. 
    
  3.8.      No Defaults  .  No event has occurred and no condition exists which would constitute an Event of Default pursuant to this Agreement.  The Company is not in violation in any respect of any term of any material agreement, charter instrument, bylaw or other material instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound, which violation would have a Material Adverse Effect.

On the date of the issuance of any Letter of Credit pursuant to the Facility, the warranties and representations set forth in this Section 3 shall be true and correct on and as of such date with the same effect as though such warranties and representations 

had been made on and as of such date, except to the extent that such warranties and representations expressly relate to an earlier date. 
    
  4.      Company Business Covenants  .  The Company covenants that on and after the date of this Agreement until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or so long as any of the indebtedness provided for herein remains unpaid: 
    
  4.1.      Payment of Taxes  .  The Company shall pay all taxes, estimated payments, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or its property or assets or in respect of any of its franchises, businesses, income or property before any penalty or interest accrues thereon; provided, however, that no such taxes, estimated payments, assessments and governmental charges are required to be paid if being contested in good faith by the Company, by appropriate proceedings diligently instituted and conducted, without any of the same becoming a lien upon the Cash Collateral, and if such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in accordance with GAAP, shall have been made therefor.

As used above, the term "Regulation" shall include any federal, state or international law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and enactments, issuances or similar pronouncements by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices or any similar authority and any successor thereto) that applies to Bank.

DEBTOR: WI Homes, Inc, 
  ADDRESS: 3 Easton Oval, Columbus, Ohio 43219 
  DATE:    July   .   27, 2009                                                  
  The undersigned ("Debtor whether one or more), for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, hereby jointly and severally grant, pledge and assign to U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association ("Bank"), a security interest in the following deposit account (the "Account") whether Debtor's interest in the Account be now owned or existing or hereafter arising or acquired, together with all substitutions and replacements therefor, all books and records relating thereto, all interest and increases arising therefrom or payable in respect thereto, whether in cash, property or otherwise, and whether now or hereafter earned, paid or made, and all cash and non-cash proceeds thereof including, but not limited to, notes, drafts, checks and instruments: 
     Account Description    Principal Amount of 
  Name and Address of Depository        and Number            Account Balance Assigned 
    
  U.S. Bank National Association      13011679473           

(all of the foregoing hereinafter sometimes called the "Collateral"). 
  If the Account is less than the entire amount of the deposit account, any reduction of the monies comprising such deposit account shall be deemed first to be a reduction of monies other than those comprising the Account, unless the amount of such reduction is received by Bank. Nothing set forth in this paragraph shall authorize or be construed to authorize Debtor to spend, withdraw, reduce, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Collateral except upon the prior written consent of Bank. 
  The security interest hereby granted is to secure the prompt and full payment and complete performance of all Obligations of Debtor to Bank. The word "Obligations" means all indebtedness, debts and liabilities (including principal, interest, late charges, collection costs, attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law and the like) of Debtor to Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued pursuant to any applicable Reimbursement Agreement(s) (as said terms are defined in the Credit Agreement hereinafter defined), whether now existing or hereafter arising, either created by Debtor alone or together with another or others, primary or secondary, secured or unsecured, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, direct or indirect, whether evidenced by note, draft, application for letter of credit, reimbursement agreement or otherwise, and any and all renewals of or substitutes therefor. 
  1.      General Representations and Covenants  :    Debtor represents, warrants and covenants as 
  follows: 
  (a)    Except for the security interest granted hereby, Debtor is, or as to Collateral arising or to be acquired after the date hereof, shall be, the sole, exclusive and record owner of the Collateral, and the Collateral is and shall remain free from any and all liens, security interests, encumbrances, claims and interests. 

(b)    Debtor shall, at Debtor's expense, perform, do, make, procure, execute and deliver all acts, things, certificates, instruments, passbooks, writings and other assurances as Bank may at any time request or require to protect, assure or enforce its interests, rights and remedies created by, provided in or emanating from this agreement. 
    
  (c)     If any of the Collateral is not now evidenced by a certificate, instrument, passbook or writing, and if at any time during the term of this agreement, a certificate, instrument, passbook or writing shall be used or issued to evidence Debtor's interest in the Collateral, Debtor shall, immediately upon learning of the same, notify in writing the loan officer who is handling Debtor's Obligations on behalf of Bank that such has occurred, or that such is going to occur, and shall assist. Bank in order to ensure that Bank obtains possession of that evidence or otherwise perfects its security interest in the certificate, instrument, passbook or writing evidencing the Collateral. 
    
  (d)     Debtor shall not create, permit or suffer to exist, and shall take such action as is necessary to remove, any claim to or interest in or lien or encumbrance upon the Collateral, other than the security interest granted hereby, and shall defend the right, title and interest of Bank in and to the Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons and entities at any time claiming the same or any interest therein. 
    
  (e)     Subject to any limitation stated therein or in connection therewith, all information furnished by Debtor concerning the Collateral or otherwise in connection with the Obligations, is or shall be at the time the same is furnished, accurate, correct and complete in all material respects. 
  (f)     Debtor's legal name, state of organization and chief executive office are as set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. Unless Bank consents in writing to a change in Debtor's legal name or state of organization prior to such a change, Debtor shall not change its legal name or state of organization. 
    
  2.      Preservation and Disposition of Collateral. 
    
  (a)    Debtor shall not spend, withdraw, reduce, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Account or any portion thereof. Bank shall be entitled to condition withdraws from the Account upon the receipt of such matters as it may reasonably request, including, but not limited to, evidence that Debtor is in full compliance with each of the terms and conditions of, and that no Event of Default exists under that certain Master Letter of Credit Facility Agreement dated as of July 27, 2009 (the "Credit Agreement"), evidencing the Obligations. 
    
  (b)     Debtor shall advise Bank promptly, in writing and in reasonable detail, (i) of any material encumbrance upon or claim asserted against any of the Collateral; and (ii) of the occurrence of any event that would have a material effect upon the aggregate value of the Collateral or upon the security interest of Bank. 
    
  (c)        At its option, Bank may discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on or arising in connection with the Collateral. Debtor agrees to reimburse Bank upon demand for any payment made or any expense incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law) by Bank pursuant to the foregoing authorization. Should Debtor fail to pay said sum to Bank upon demand, interest shall accrue thereon, from the date of demand until paid in full, at the highest rate set forth in any document or instrument evidencing any of the Obligations. 
    
  3.      Extensions and Compromises.   With respect to any Collateral held by Bank as security for the Obligations, Debtor assents to all extensions or postponements of the time of payment thereof or any other indulgence in connection therewith, to each substitution, exchange or release of Collateral, to the addition or release of any party primarily or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payments thereon and to the settlement, compromise or adjustment thereof, all in such manner and at such time or times as Bank may deem advisable. Bank shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of Collateral or any income therefrom, nor as to the preservation of any right pertaining thereto, beyond the safe custody of Collateral in the possession of Bank. 
    
  4.      Bank's Authorization.   Debtor hereby irrevocably authorizes Bank and any officer or agent thereof, in the place and stead of Debtor and in the name of Debtor or in Bank's own name, in Bank's discretion, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute, authenticate and deliver any and all documents, instruments and records that  

may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Debtor hereby authorizes Bank, on behalf of Debtor, without notice to or assent by Debtor. 
  Debtor hereby ratifies all that the Bank shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. 
  The authorization granted to Bank hereunder is solely to protect its interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon Bank to exercise the same. Bank shall be accountable only for amounts that Bank actually receives as a result of the exercise of such authorization and neither Bank nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to Debtor for any act or failure to act, except for Bank's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
  5.      Default.   If any event of default in the payment of any of the Obligations or in the performance of any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any instrument or document evidencing the Obligations secured by this agreement or in the performance of any covenant contained herein shall occur and be continuing; or if any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Bank by Debtor proves to have been false in any material respect when made or furnished; or if Bank shall, in the exercise of commercially reasonable judgment, deem itself insecure as to the prospect of payment of any of the Obligations: 
    
  (a)  Bank may, at its option and without notice, declare the unpaid balance of any or all of the Obligations immediately due and payable and this agreement and any or all of the Obligations in default and may immediately apply any or all of the Collateral to the payment of the Obligations; and 
    
  (b)    Bank and its nominees shall have the additional rights and remedies of a secured party under this agreement, under any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations and under the law of the State of Ohio including, but not limited to, the right to demand and receive the Collateral from any of the depositories designated above. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Debtor waives all claims, damages and demands against Bank arising out of Bank's collection, receipt, retention or disposition of the Collateral including, but not limited to, any claim based upon the early withdrawal or redemption of the Collateral by Bank. Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the Collateral is insufficient to pay all amounts to which Bank is entitled. Debtor shall also be liable for the costs of collecting any of the Obligations or otherwise enforcing the terms thereof or of this agreement including reasonable attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law. 
  6.      General.   Debtor agrees that if Bank is the depository for any Account, Bank may reduce the rate of interest on such Account, at any time and from time to time, in order to comply with any laws or regulations, including those that require the rate of interest applicable to any Obligation to exceed any rate of interest payable with respect to such Account. Any provision of this agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Bank shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights hereunder or under any other agreement, instrument or paper signed by Debtor unless such waiver be in writing and signed by Bank. No delay or omission on the part of Bank in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. All of Bank's rights and remedies, whether evidenced hereby or by any other agreement, instrument or paper, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Any written demand upon or written notice to the Debtor shall be given in accordance with the Loan Agreement shall be effective when deposited in the mails addressed to the Debtor at the address shown at the beginning of this Agreement. This agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder, including matters of construction, validity and performance, shall be governed by the law of the State of Ohio. The provisions hereof shall, as the case may require, bind or inure to the benefit of, the respective heirs, successors, legal representatives and assigns of Debtor and Bank..
