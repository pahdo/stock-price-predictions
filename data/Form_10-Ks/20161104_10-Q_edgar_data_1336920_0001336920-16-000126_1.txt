Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  
  Leidos Holdings, Inc. ("Leidos"), a holding company whose direct   100%  -owned subsidiaries are Leidos, Inc. and Leidos Innovations Corporation ("Leidos Innovations"), is a global science and technology solutions company that provides technology and engineering solutions in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, civil and health markets. Leidos' domestic customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), the Department of Health and Human Services, other U.S. Government civil agencies and state and local government agencies. Leidos' international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Australia. Unless indicated otherwise, references to the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer collectively to Leidos Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Leidos include the balances of its majority-owned and   100%  -owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial information has been prepared in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including those relating to indirect cost billings, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, fair value and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, estimated profitability of long-term contracts, pension benefits, stock-based compensation expense and contingencies. Estimates have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  On August 16, 2016, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos Holdings, Inc. merged with the Information Systems   Global Solutions business (the "IS GS Business") of Lockheed Martin Corporation in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The acquired IS GS Business was renamed Leidos Innovations Corporation. See "Note 2 Acquisitions" for further information. 
  As a result of the Lockheed Martin transaction, the Company received an interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC ("MSA"), a joint venture with Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. and Centerra Group, LLC. The Company has consolidated the financial results for MSA into its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company disaggregated "Goodwill and intangible assets, net" into "Goodwill" and "Intangible assets, net"; separately disclosed "Dividends payable" and "Income taxes payable," which were previously aggregated within "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities"; and separately disclosed "Deferred tax liabilities," which was previously aggregated within "Other long-term liabilities," on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Additionally, the Company separately disclosed "Restructuring expenses," which was previously aggregated within "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on the condensed consolidated statements of income.  
  During the Company's first quarter ended April 1, 2016, the company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , resulting in a reclassification of deferred financing costs related to the Company's notes of   $7 million   from "Other assets" to "Notes payable and long-term debt, net of current portion" in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2016 (see "Accounting Standards Updates Adopted" below).

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation thereof. The results reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1); inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions (Level 3).  
  The Company s cash equivalents were primarily comprised of investments in several large institutional money market funds and bank deposits, with original maturity of three months or less. There are immaterial restrictions on the withdrawal of the Company s cash and cash equivalents of foreign currency due to exchange control regulations. The Company's cash equivalents are recorded at historical cost, which equals fair value based on quoted market prices (Level 1 input).  
  The Company's financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consisted of the Company's interest rate swaps on its   $450 million   fixed rate   4.45%   notes maturing in December 2020 and its interest rate swaps on   $1.2 billion   of the aggregate principal outstanding on the Company's variable rate senior secured notes (see "Note 8 Derivative Instruments"). At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.  
  The Company s non-financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets. The valuation methods used to determine fair value require a significant degree of management judgment to determine the key assumptions. As such, the Company generally classifies non-financial instruments as either Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurements. On August 16, 2016, the Company had non-financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in connection with the acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS GS Business. Refer to "Note 2 Acquisitions" for the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any non-financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, other than derivatives, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are reasonable estimates of their related fair values. The carrying value of the Company's notes receivable as of September 30, 2016, of   $92 million   approximates fair value as the stated interest rates within the agreements are consistent with the current market rates used in notes with similar terms in the market (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of long-term debt (see "Note 9 Debt") is determined based on current interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company s existing debt arrangements (Level 2     inputs).  
  Changes in Estimates on Contracts 
  Changes in estimates related to certain types of contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, contract cost estimates and estimated incentive or award fees.  
  Changes in estimates on contracts for the periods presented were as follows:

Accounting Standards Updates Adopted 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . This update eliminates separate presentation for debt issuance costs as an asset and requires issuance costs to be reported in the balance sheet as a direct reduction to the face amount of the associated debt. The Company adopted this ASU on a retrospective basis during the Company's first quarter ended April 1, 2016. This resulted in a reclassification of deferred financing costs related to the Company's notes of   $7 million   from "Other assets" to "Notes payable and long-term debt, net of current portion" in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2016.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. Among other requirements in the new standard, the ASU requires that an entity, (i) recognize excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee share-based payment transactions as an income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than in equity; (ii) present the excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows versus current guidance to present them as financing activities; and, (iii) elect to either recognize stock forfeitures as they occur or estimate them. During the quarter ended July 1, 2016, the Company elected to early adopt the provisions of the ASU prospectively from January 2, 2016, including continuation of estimating forfeitures instead of recording them as they occur. Consequently, the Company recognized a   $3 million   and   $7 million   discrete tax benefit for the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2016, respectively, and operating cash flows for the six months ended July 1, 2016, increased   $7 million   with a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows.

Accounting Standards Updates Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts). This ASU will supersede all revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. The guidance's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue principles, an entity will identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied (either over time or at a point in time). The ASU further states that an entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the ASU from the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, to annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, with an option for early adoption of the standard on the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , that amended the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 805): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  , which rescinded from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") certain SEC paragraphs as a result of two SEC Staff Announcements. The FASB also issued ASU 2016-12   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which clarified guidance on assessment of collectibility, presentation of sale taxes, measurement of noncash consideration and certain transition matters. The Company is evaluating the impact that the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and related subsequent updates will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU will supersede the current lease guidance under ASC 840 and makes several changes, such as requiring an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligation in the balance sheet, classified as financing or operating, as appropriate. The standard requires adoption under the modified retrospective approach and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and its impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU eliminates the requirement that a credit loss on a financial instrument be  probable  prior to recognition. Instead, a valuation allowance will be recorded to reflect an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses, based on both historical and forecasted information related to an instrument. The amendments in the update will be effective for public Companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years and should be adopted using a modified-retrospective approach, which applies a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. A prospective approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date and loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality. The guidance may be early-adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU clarifies guidance for cash flow classification to reduce current and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. For items that are impractical to apply the amendments retrospectively, they shall be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The amendments in this Update are effective for public entities beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-15 and its impact on the Company's condensed consolidated cash flows.  
   
  Note 2 Acquisitions  
  On January 26, 2016, Leidos announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"); Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin ("Splitco"); and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and, at the time of announcement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Leidos would combine with Lockheed Martin s realigned Information Systems   Global Solutions business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Lockheed Martin and Splitco entered into a Separation Agreement dated January 26, 2016 (as amended, the "Separation Agreement"), pursuant to which Lockheed Martin would separate the IS GS Business from Lockheed Martin and transfer the IS GS Business to Splitco. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are referred to herein as the  Transactions.  
  On August 16, 2016, the acquisition date, the Company completed the Transactions. In the Transactions, among other steps, (i) Lockheed Martin transferred the IS GS Business to Splitco; (ii) Lockheed Martin offered to Lockheed Martin stockholders the right to exchange all or a portion of their shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Splitco common stock by way of an exchange offer (the "Distribution"); and (iii) Merger Sub merged with and into Splitco, with Splitco as the surviving corporation (the "Merger") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos. Additionally, on the closing date of the Transactions, Splitco's name was changed to Leidos Innovations Corporation. Upon consummation of the Transactions, those Lockheed Martin stockholders who elected to participate in the exchange offer received approximately   77 million   shares of Leidos common stock, which represent approximately   50.5%   of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock after consummation of the Transactions. Holders of Leidos shares prior to the transaction held the remaining   49.5%   of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock immediately after the closing.  
  Prior to the Distribution, Splitco incurred third-party debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of   $1.8 billion   and immediately thereafter, Lockheed Martin transferred the IS GS Business to Splitco and Splitco made a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin of   $1.8 billion  .  
  In connection with the Transactions, Leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed Splitco's indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of   $690 million   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively, and entered into a new   $750 million   senior secured revolving credit facility, which replaced its existing revolving credit facility. See "Note 9 Debt" for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility. 
  In conjunction with the Transactions, Leidos' Board of Directors declared a special dividend of   $13.64   per share of Leidos common stock. On August 22, 2016, the Company paid   $993 million   to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016. As a result of the special dividend declaration, the Company accrued   $29 million   of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding equity awards. See "Note 12 Stock Based Compensation" for further information regarding the modifications made to the Company's outstanding stock awards as a result of the special dividend. 
  In connection with the Transactions, membership on the Leidos Board of Directors was increased to   12   directors, in which   three   directors designated by Lockheed Martin were appointed to the board. A majority of the senior management of Leidos immediately prior the consummation of the Transactions remained Leidos executive officers immediately after the Transactions. Leidos management determined that Leidos is the accounting acquirer in the Transactions based on the facts and circumstances noted within this section and other relevant factors. 
  The acquisition adds large, complex IT system implementation and operation experience and additional federal and international IT solutions and services work to the Leidos portfolio, providing more venues to sell value added services such as cybersecurity and analytics. As a result, the Company is more diversified in markets it serves and provides the Company the scale and access to markets intended to further growth.

Due to the recent completion and complexity of the Transactions, the Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their preliminary estimated fair values. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not finalized the determination of fair values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to,     receivables, net; property, plant and equipment; deferred income taxes; deferred revenue; intangible assets; accounts payable and accrued liabilities; loss contracts; non-controlling interest; and the residual amount allocated to goodwill. The preli  minary     p  urchase price allocation is subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of the Transactions. 
  The goodwill is attributable to the new reportable IS GS segment. The goodwill represents intellectual capital and the acquired assembled work force, none of which qualify for recognition as a separate intangible asset. The preliminary goodwill presented above includes   $348 million   of tax deductible goodwill.

Note 3 Restructuring Expenses 
  IS GS Business Acquisition 
  After the acquisition of the IS GS Business, the Company initiated a program to align its cost structure, which includes optimization of its real estate portfolio by vacating certain facilities and consolidating others, and by reducing headcount. The Company anticipates this restructuring program to last through fiscal 2018 and expects to incur approximately   $143 million   in connection with these restructuring activities. 
  The restructuring expenses related to this program were as follows:

  The Company does not expect the restructuring liability to be fully settled within   one year  . 
  Separation of New SAIC and Real Estate Optimization Initiatives 
  In fiscal 2014, in anticipation of the spin-off of New SAIC from the Company, the Company initiated an overall spin-off program to align the Company s cost structure for post spin-off. The Company has continued its real estate optimization initiatives post separation to improve its cost profile and has exited real estate leases and incurred restructuring charges consisting of various expenses such as lease termination fees, asset impairment charges and lease vacancy reserves.  
  The restructuring expenses related to the separation of New SAIC and the Company's real estate optimization initiatives were as follows:   

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015, the lease termination expenses related to lease losses and an adjustment to reserves for lease losses from the spin-off due to revised sublease income assumptions. The termination expenses were recorded within the Corporate and Other segment and presented separately within "Restructuring expenses" on the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  The Company did not incur lease termination expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015.

  Note 4 Divestitures 
  Dispositions 
  In April 2016, the Company s Health and Infrastructure Sector ("HIS") segment disposed of a business that was primarily focused on providing design, build and heavy construction engineering services. The Company received cash proceeds of   $23 million  , resulting in a preliminary pre-tax gain on sale of   $3 million  , subject to certain customary working capital adjustments. The major classes of assets and liabilities sold included   $73 million   of accounts receivable, net;   $3 million   of non-current assets and   $63 million   of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, the Company recorded a   $6 million   liability in connection with issuance of a performance guarantee on a contract sold and guarantee of collection of the accounts receivables transferred. The Company paid   $1 million   of selling costs related to the transaction. The Company is eligible to receive contingent consideration up to   $2 million   upon achievement of certain income targets. The Company will record any contingent consideration when payments are received. The Company recorded the preliminary pre-tax gain on sale in "Other (expense) income, net" in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income.  
  Plainfield Renewable Energy Holdings LLC  
  In March 2015, the Company entered into a definitive Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") to sell   100%   of the equity membership interest in Plainfield Renewable Energy Holdings, LLC ("Plainfield"). This resulted in a   $40 million   impairment charge in the Company's HIS segment in January 2015 to adjust the carrying values of Plainfield's assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business (Level 1). During the quarter ended July 3, 2015, further negotiations occurred related to the sale of Plainfield resulting in an additional   $29 million   impairment charge. The Company adjusted the carrying values of Plainfield's assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business pursuant to the terms of the Agreement that was amended on July 17, 2015 (Level 1). These impairment charges are presented separately in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  On July 24, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its equity interests in Plainfield for an aggregate consideration of   $102 million  , subject to certain adjustments and contingent earn-out payments. The consideration received by the Company at closing consisted of a cash payment of   $29 million   and a secured promissory note for   $73 million  , net of discount (the  Note ). The Note is payable semi-annually with a final lump sum in   July 2018  . The Company collected   $6 million   of principal and interest during 2016 and expects the remainder of the Note to be collectible in full. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  Separation of New SAIC  
  The Company completed the spin-off of New SAIC on September 27, 2013. New SAIC was a subsidiary of Leidos prior to the separation date. The spin-off was consummated pursuant to the terms of a Distribution Agreement and several other agreements entered into between the Company and New SAIC on September 25, 2013. These agreements govern the treatment of existing contracts, proposals and teaming arrangements where New SAIC will jointly perform work after separation on Leidos contracts.

Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  As mentioned in "Note 2 Acquisitions," the acquired IS GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment. The balance and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:   

  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, at the beginning of the fourth quarter and during interim periods whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. There were no goodwill impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015. 
  Intangible assets, including the preliminary fair values of those acquired through the purchase of the IS GS Business, consisted of the following:   

  During the quarter ended October 2, 2015, the Company determined that certain customer relationship intangible assets associated with Vitalize and maxIT were not recoverable due to lower projected revenue and operating income levels from the associated customers. As a result, the Health and Infrastructure Sector reportable segment recognized an impairment charge of   $4 million   to write-off the remaining carrying value (with a gross carrying value of   $38 million  ).

     Table of Contents  
    
  LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

The fair value of the impairment charge was estimated using the income approach based on management's forecast of future cash flows to be derived from the assets' use (Level 3). The Company recorded the intangible asset impairment charge in "Asset impairment charges" in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was   $27 million   and   $30 million   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $2 million   and   $7 million   for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively. The acquired programs and contract intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future cash flows on a discounted basis. The acquired backlog intangible assets, as well as the Company's existing customer relationships and software and technology intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
  The estimated annual amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2016, was as follows:   

  The estimated future amortization may change based on the finalization of the fair value of the acquired intangible assets. 
   
  Note 6 Receivables 
  The components of receivables, net, consisted of the following:   

  The Company's accounts receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as billable receivables that generally consist of amounts to be billed within the next month. Since the Company's receivables are primarily with the U.S. Government, the Company does not have exposure to a material credit risk.  
  Amounts billable are stated at estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees, substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected within one year. Amounts billable also include rate variances that are billable upon negotiation of final indirect rates with the U.S. Government and once billed, are subject to audit and approval by government representatives.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Contract retentions are billed upon contract completion, or the occurrence of a specified event, and when negotiations of final indirect rates with the U.S. Government are complete. Consequently, the timing of collection of retention balances is outside the Company's control. Based on the Company's historical experience, the majority of retention balances are expected to be collected beyond one year and write-offs of retention balances have not been significant. When events or conditions indicate that amounts outstanding from customers may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded. 
  The Company recorded "Bad debt expense" of   $1 million   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and   $13 million   and   $10 million   for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively. 
   
  Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:   

  Depreciation expense was   $10 million   and   $24 million   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $9 million   and   $28 million   for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively. The asset balances and related depreciation may change upon finalization of the valuation of the acquired assets (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). 
   
  Note 8 Derivative Instruments 
  The Company manages its risk to changes in interest rates through the use of derivative instruments. The Company does not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For fixed rate borrowings, the Company uses variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, the Company uses fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  In September 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fair value of the   $450 million   fixed rate   4.45%   senior secured notes maturing in December 2020 (the  Notes ). The objective of these instruments is to hedge the Notes against changes in fair value due to the variability in the six-month LIBOR rate (the benchmark interest rate). Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company will receive semi-annual interest payments at the coupon rate of   4.45%   and will pay variable interest based on the six-month LIBOR rate. 
  The interest rate swaps were accounted for as a fair value hedge of the Notes and qualified for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, which allows for the assumption of no ineffectiveness reported in earnings. The resulting changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are fully offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying debt (the hedged item). The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for underlying interest rates on the LIBOR yield curve (Level 2).  
  The fair value of the Notes is stated at an amount that reflects changes in the benchmark interest rate, the six-month LIBOR rate, subsequent to the inception of the interest rate swaps through the reporting date.

Cash Flow Hedges 
  In August 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to   $1.2 billion   of the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans (the "Variable Rate Loans"). The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's Variable Rate Loans, which is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, which mature in December 2021, the Company will receive monthly variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate of   1.08%  . The counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions.  
  The interest rate swaps were accounted for as a cash flow hedge of the Variable Rate Loans and qualified for hedge accounting treatment through the application of the long-haul method, which involves the comparison of cumulative changes in the fair value of the swap to the cumulative change in fair value of scheduled interest payments on the notional value (the perfectly effective hypothetical or "PEH"). The effective portion of the gain/loss on the swap will be reported as a component of other comprehensive income/loss and will be reclassified into earnings on the dates the interest payments impact earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, recorded in earnings will be equal to the excess of the cumulative change in fair value of the swap over the cumulative change in the fair value of the PEH. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for the underlying interest rate (Level 2).  
  The fair value of the interest rate swaps was as follows:

Note 9 Debt 
  Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt 
  The Company's notes payable and long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Senior Secured Notes 
  As a result of executing the fair value interest swap agreements, the carrying values of the   4.45%   senior secured notes at September 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016, included   $17 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, of the fair value of interest rate swaps (see "Note 8 Derivative Instruments"). 
  Senior Secured Term Loans 
  On August 16, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the IS GS Business, Leidos, Inc. secured a new term loan of   $690 million   from certain financial institutions. In addition, as a result of the acquisition, Leidos assumed the IS GS Business' term loans of   $1.8 billion  , which were obtained by the IS GS Business immediately prior to the Transactions (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). The outstanding obligations under the term loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the credit agreements and related documentation.  
  The interest rate on these new borrowings is determined based on the LIBOR rate plus a margin. The margin for these notes ranges from   1.75%   to   2.25%  , depending on the Company's senior secured leverage ratio, and is re-determined on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2016, the current margin on Term Loan A was   2.25%  . The stated margin on Term Loan B is   2.75%  . 
  As part of the credit agreements, the Company is required to perform a calculation each quarter that determines the incremental available amount of funds the Company is permitted to use towards investments relating to mergers and acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, repayment of outstanding debt and restricted payments relating to dividends and share repurchases. The incremental available amount is calculated as   $35 million   plus a portion of certain cash proceeds, multiplied by a percentage tied to the Company's senior secured leverage, which is added to an annual fixed amount of   $250 million  , as defined in the credit agreements. The constraints associated with use of cash are reduced and/or eliminated based on the Company's senior secured leverage ratio.

The Company is also required to perform an excess cash flow calculation annually that determines the additional amount of debt prepayments the Company is required to make during the first quarter of the following fiscal year, with the first payment occurring in 2018. The excess cash flow is calculated based on the Company's consolidated net income as of the end of the fiscal year plus or minus adjustments for certain non-cash items and incurred and expected cash payments, as defined in the credit agreements. The amount of the excess cash flow that the Company is required to use to prepay the loans is based upon the Company's senior secured leverage ratio. The required debt prepayment amount is equal to   50%   of the excess cash flow calculated if the senior secured leverage ratio is greater than   2.75   and is equal to   25%   of the excess cash flow calculated if the ratio is between   2.75   and   2.00  .   No   additional debt prepayment is required if the senior secured leverage ratio is less than   2.00  . 
  On September 30, 2016, the Company repaid   $100 million   of its senior secured   $400 million   Term Loan A, due   August 2019  . Associated with this early repayment,   $2 million   of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs were written off and recorded to "Other (expense) income, net" in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Principal is payable on the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans on a quarterly basis, with the majority of the principal due at maturity. Interest is payable on the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans on a periodic basis, which must be at least quarterly. Interest is payable on the Company's senior fixed rate secured notes and unsecured notes on a semi-annual basis with principal payments due at maturity. 
  In connection with the new senior secured term loans, the Company recognized   $53 million   of debt discount and debt issuance costs, which were recorded as an offset against the carrying value of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the term loans. Amortization for the senior secured term loans and notes and unsecured notes for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $3 million   in each period, and for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015 was immaterial and   $1 million  , respectively.  
  The senior secured term loans and notes, unsecured notes and revolving credit facility (see "Revolving Credit Facility" below) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by intercompany guarantees. The senior secured term loans and notes and unsecured notes contain certain customary restrictive covenants, including among other things, restrictions on the Company's ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions under certain circumstances. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2016.

  On August 16, 2016, Leidos, Inc. entered into a revolving credit facility providing up to   $750 million   in secured borrowing capacity at interest rates determined based upon the LIBOR rate plus a margin that is subject to step-down provisions based on the Company's senior secured leverage ratio. The maturity date of this credit facility is   August 2021  . Leidos, Inc. recognized   $15 million   of origination costs related to the new credit facility, which were capitalized within "Other assets" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility.  
  The new credit facility replaced the previous   $500 million   credit facility that was set to expire in   March 2018  . The remaining deferred costs associated with the former credit facility that were written-off during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, were immaterial. As of January 1, 2016, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the former credit facility. 
  The credit agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties, as well as certain affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenants define the debt-to-EBITDA ratio that the Company needs to maintain at the end of each quarter. The Company maintains a ratio of total senior secured debt, including borrowings under this credit facility, to the trailing   four   quarters of EBITDA (adjusted for certain items as defined in the credit facility) of not more than   4.75   prior to February 16, 2018,   4.25   from February 16, 2018, to February 16, 2019, and   3.75   thereafter. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 
  Other covenants in the credit agreements restrict certain of the Company's activities, including, among other things, its ability to create liens, dispose of certain assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The credit facility also contains certain customary events of default, including, among others, defaults based on certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment, cross-defaults to other debt, breach of specified covenants, Employee Retirement Income Security Act events, material monetary judgments, change of control events and the material inaccuracy of the Company's representations and warranties.

Note 10 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows: 

Reclassifications from other comprehensive loss to net income relating to unrecognized net gain (loss) on derivative instruments associated with outstanding debt for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015, were not material. There were no reclassifications from other comprehensive loss to net income relating to foreign currency translation adjustments or unrecognized net gain (loss) on defined benefit plan during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015. Reclassifications for unrecognized net gain (loss) on derivative instruments associated with outstanding debt are recorded in "Interest expense, net" in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income. 
   
  Note 11 Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Leidos stockholders by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic EPS, except the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards. 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted EPS for the periods presented:    

  Anti-dilutive stock-based awards are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted EPS. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was an immaterial amount of outstanding stock options and vesting stock awards that were antidilutive. For the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015, there were a total of   2 million   of outstanding stock options and vesting stock awards that were antidilutive in each period.  
  As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 during the quarter ended July 1, 2016, the excess tax benefit was removed from the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method used to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards (see "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). This resulted in an immaterial increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

Note 12 Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation and related tax benefits were as follows: 

Stock Options 
  The fair value of the Company's stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes- 
  Merton option-pricing model. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, expected volatility was based on using a blended approach, which included weighted average historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded peer companies, weighted average historical volatility of the Company and the weighted average implied volatility. The Company will continue to use peer group volatility information, until sufficient historical volatility of the Company's common stock is relevant, to measure expected volatility for future option grants. The expected volatility increased from pre-acquisition to post-acquisition due to a higher allocation of peer group volatility used post-acquisition compared to a higher allocation of historical volatility used pre-acquisition. The post-acquisition volatility reflected an updated peer group mix. The risk-free rate is derived using the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option on the grant date. The dividend yield increased from pre-acquisition to post-acquisition due to historical stock price fluctuations. The Company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures. 
  The assumptions used to determine fair value of stock options granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015 were as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
  In connection with the IS GS Business acquisition (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"), the Company issued   0.6 million   replacement RSUs valued at   $23 million  , of which   $9 million   was allocated as purchase consideration attributed to pre-acquisition service and the remaining   $12 million   represents the total remaining stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures. This remaining expense will be recognized over   three years  . 
  Special Dividend Adjustment 
  As a result of the payment of the special cash dividend to Leidos stockholders in August 2016, Leidos modified all outstanding stock options to preserve their original grant date fair value. The modifications resulted in a reduction in the strike prices of the outstanding stock options by a factor of   0.74   and an increase in the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of each option by a factor of   1.35   between the pre-modification stock price and post-modification stock price. These adjustments did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding options immediately following the payment of the special cash dividend was equal to the fair value immediately prior to such distribution. The modifications resulted in an increase in options outstanding by   0.9 million  . The special dividend declared was   $993 million  . As a result of the special dividend declaration, the Company accrued   $29 million   of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding equity awards. The transactions

associated with the special cash dividend were recorded to "Additional paid-in capital" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  Note 13 Income Taxes  
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was   (22.7)%   compared to   38.8%   for the quarter ended October 2, 2015. The lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend, related to the Transactions described in "Note 2 Acquisitions", on shares held by the Leidos retirement plan, an income tax benefit from the resolution of certain tax contingencies with the tax authorities, and a tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was   12.7%   compared to   29.7%   for the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend on shares held by the Leidos retirement plan and a tax benefit realized for excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions (see discussion of ASU 2016-09 in "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). The adoption of this new accounting standard could result in fluctuations in the effective tax rate period over period depending on the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized. 
  The Company files income tax returns in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Compliance Assurance Process, a real-time audit of the Company's consolidated federal corporate income tax return. The IRS has examined the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through fiscal 2015. With a few exceptions, as of September 30, 2016, the Company is no longer subject to state, local or foreign examinations by the tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits included liabilities for uncertain tax positions of   $6 million  , of which   $5 million   were classified as other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. While the Company believes it has adequate accruals for uncertain tax positions, the tax authorities may determine that the Company owes taxes in excess of recorded accruals or the recorded accruals may be in excess of the final settlement amounts agreed to by the tax authorities. 
   
  Note 14 Business Segments 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS GS Business (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). The acquired IS GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment. 
  In April 2016, the Company sold its design, build and heavy construction engineering business (see "Note 4 Divestitures"). Consequently, the reportable segment of Health and Engineering was renamed as Health and Infrastructure Sector.  
  At September 30, 3016, Leidos' reportable segments were: National Security Solutions ("NSS"), Health and Infrastructure Sector ("HIS"), Information Systems   Global Solutions ("IS GS") and Corporate and Other.

The segment information for the periods presented was as follows: 

Asset information by segment is not a key measure of performance used by the chief operating decision maker, currently the chief executive officer. Other income (expense), interest income, interest expense and provision for income taxes, as reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements, are not part of operating income and are primarily recorded at the corporate level. Under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, indirect costs including depreciation expense are collected in numerous indirect cost pools, which are then collectively allocated out to the Company s reportable segments based on a representative causal or beneficial relationship of the costs in the pool to the costs in the base.

Note 15 Legal Proceedings 
  MSA Venture 
  On November 10, 2015, MSA received a final decision of the Department of Energy ("DoE") contracting officer for the Mission Support Contract concluding that certain payments to MSA by DoE for the performance of IT services by Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. ( LMSI ) under a subcontract to MSA constituted alleged affiliate fees in violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the "FAR"). Lockheed Martin Integrated Technology LLC (now known as Leidos Integrated Technology LLC) is a member entity of MSA. At the same time, the contracting officer advised MSA that he would not approve certain provisional fee payments to MSA pending resolution of the matters set forth in his decision. Subsequent to the contracting officer's final decision, MSA, LMSI, and Lockheed Martin Corporation received notice from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington that the U.S. Government had initiated a False Claims Act investigation into the facts surrounding this dispute, and each of MSA, LMSI and Lockheed Martin Corporation have produced information in response to Civil Investigative Demands from the U.S. Attorney's Office. Since this issue first was raised by the DoE, MSA has asserted that the IT services performed by LMSI under a fixed price/fixed unit rate subcontract approved by the DoE meet the definition of a "commercial item" under the FAR and any profits earned on that subcontract are permissible. MSA filed an appeal of the contracting officer's decision with the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals and that appeal is pending, but has been stayed pending resolution of the False Claims Act investigation. Subsequent to the filing of MSA's appeal, the contracting officer demanded that MSA reimburse the DoE in the amount of   $64 million  , which was his estimate of the profits earned during the period from 2010 to 2014 by LMSI. The DoE has deferred that demand, pending resolution of the appeal, but to date the demand has not been rescinded. MSA and the other members of MSA have indicated they believe if MSA incurs a liability in this matter, then Leidos Integrated Technology, LLC is responsible to MSA for the loss. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Lockheed Martin has agreed to indemnify the Company for   100%   of any damages in excess of   $38 million   up to   $64 million  , and   50%   of any damages in excess of   $64 million  , with respect to claims asserted against MSA related to this matter. At September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a liability of   $40 million   and an indemnification asset of   $2 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Data Privacy Litigation  
  The Company was previously a defendant in a putative class action,   In Re: Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC") Backup Tape Data Theft Litigation  , which was a Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL") action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia relating to the theft of computer backup tapes from a vehicle of a company employee. In May 2014, the District Court dismissed all but   two   plaintiffs from the MDL action. In June 2014, Leidos and its co-defendant, TRICARE, entered into settlement agreements with the remaining   two   plaintiffs who subsequently dismissed their claims with prejudice. 
  On September 20, 2014, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action,   Martin Fernandez, on Behalf Of Himself And All Other Similarly Situated v. Leidos, Inc.   in the Eastern District Court of California, related to the same theft of computer backup tapes. The recent complaint includes allegations of violations of the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the California Unfair Competition Law and other claims. On August 28, 2015, the Court dismissed all claims brought by the Plaintiff against the Company. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of this dismissal on November 17, 2015, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the appeal remains pending. Plaintiff filed his appellate brief on May 6, 2016. Leidos filed its response on July 6, 2016 and Plaintiff filed his reply on August 19, 2016.

Securities Litigation 
  Between February and April 2012, alleged stockholders filed   three   putative securities class actions.   One   case was withdrawn and   two   cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in   In Re: SAIC, Inc. Securities Litigation  . The consolidated securities complaint named as defendants the Company, a former chief financial officer,   two   former chief executive officers, a former group president and the former program manager on the Company's contract to develop and implement an automated time and attendance and workforce management system for certain agencies of the City of New York ("CityTime") and was filed purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company's common stock from April 11, 2007, through September 1, 2011. The consolidated securities complaint asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations that the Company and individual defendants made misleading statements or omissions about the Company s revenues, operating income and internal controls in connection with disclosures relating to the CityTime project. The plaintiffs sought to recover from the Company and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages class members allegedly incurred by buying Leidos' stock at an inflated price. On October 1, 2013, the District Court dismissed many claims in the complaint with prejudice and on January 30, 2014, the District Court entered an order dismissing all remaining claims with prejudice and without leave to replead. The plaintiffs moved to vacate the District Court's judgment or obtain relief from the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint. On September 30, 2014, the District Court denied plaintiffs' motions. The plaintiffs then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On March 29, 2016, the Second Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part, and vacating in part, the District Court's ruling. In particular, the Second Circuit held that the plaintiffs should be permitted to pursue omissions claims against the Company with respect to the annual report the Company filed on Form 10-K on March 25, 2011; the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of all other claims, including all the claims against the individual defendants. The Company petitioned the Second Circuit on April 12, 2016 to rehear the appeal, which was denied on August 2, 2016. The case is now remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on plaintiffs' claim.  
  Greek Government Contract  
  Background and Arbitration.   In May 2003, the Company entered into a firm-fixed-price contract with the Hellenic Republic of Greece (the "Customer") to provide a Command, Control, Communications, Coordination and Integration System (the "System") to support the 2004 Athens Summer Olympic Games (the "Olympics") and to serve as the security system for the Customer s public order departments following completion of the Olympics. 
  In November 2008, the Customer accepted the System in writing pursuant to the requirements of the contract. At the time, the Customer determined that the System substantially complied with the terms of the contract and accepted the System with certain alleged minor omissions and deviations. Upon System acceptance, the Company invoiced the Customer for   $15 million  , representing the undisputed portion of the contract balance owed to the Company. The Customer has not paid this final invoice. 
  In June 2009, the Company initiated arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce against the Customer seeking damages for breaches of contract by the Customer. In July 2013, the Company received an arbitral award for   $44 million  . The Customer has yet to satisfy the arbitral award. The Company is pursuing an enforcement action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In September 2013, the Customer filed a petition in a Greek court seeking to nullify the arbitral award and to stay enforcement of the award in Greece. A hearing on the Customer's nullification request was held in Greece in April 2014. The parties agreed to a stay of the Company's enforcement action in U.S. District Court until the Greek court issued a ruling on the Customer's nullification request. In June 2014, the Athens Court of Appeals annulled the arbitral award. The Company appealed the annulment decision to the Supreme Court of Greece in January 2015 to have the arbitral award reinstated. On September 22, 2016, the Supreme Court of Greece issued a written decision upholding the Company s appeal and remanding the case back to the appeals court for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court s decision. The Company is continuing to pursue enforcement of the award in the U.S. District Court as is still its right under U.S. and international law. The outcomes of the appeal in Greece and the Company's pending enforcement action are uncertain.

Financial Status and Contingencies.   As a result of the significant uncertainties on this contract, the Company converted to the completed-contract method of accounting and ceased recognizing revenues for the System development portion of this contract in fiscal 2006. No profits or losses were recorded on the Greek contract for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and October 2, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded   $123 million   of losses under the Greek contract, reflecting the Company s estimated total cost to complete the System, assuming the Greek contract value was limited to the cash received to date. Based on the complex nature of this contractual situation and the difficulties encountered to date, significant uncertainties exist and the Company is unable to reliably estimate the ultimate outcome. The Company may reverse a portion of the losses from the Greek contract if it receives payments as provided in the arbitral award. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's net balance sheet exposure for the Greek contract was   $2 million  . 
  The Company has   $28 million   for value added tax ("VAT") included in the arbitration claim of which this amount was substantially awarded in the arbitral award. The Company has paid a certain amount of VAT and believes it is entitled to recover either as a payment from the arbitral award or as a refund from the taxing authorities. This amount paid is recorded as a receivable as of September 30, 2016, and is part of the net balance sheet exposure. If the Customer fails to pay the outstanding VAT amounts through the arbitral award or the Company is unable to recover these amounts as a refund from the taxing authorities, the Company s total losses on the Greek contract could increase. 
  The Company has met certain advance payment and performance bonding requirements through the issuance of euro-denominated standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, there were   $4 million   in standby letters of credit outstanding relating to the support and maintenance of the System. In the arbitration, the Company was awarded but has not received   $21 million   representing the amounts drawn by the Customer in fiscal 2011 on certain standby letters of credit as well as damages. The principal subcontractor has provided to the Company euro-denominated standby letters of credit in the amount of   $18 million   as of September 30, 2016, of which   $16 million   relates to the delivery of the System. The Company may draw on the subcontractor s standby letters of credit under certain circumstances by providing a statement to the responsible bank that the subcontractor has not fulfilled its obligations under the subcontract.  
  Other 
  The Company is also involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business, none of which, in the opinion of the Company s management, based upon current information, will likely have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
  Note 16 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  VirnetX, Inc.    
  In fiscal 2007, the Company transferred several patents to VirnetX Inc., a subsidiary of VirnetX Holding Corp. In consideration of this transfer, the Company received certain license rights and the right to receive a percentage of the consideration received in patent infringement or enforcement claims against third parties. In November 2012, a jury found that Apple Corporation infringed   two   of the patents that the Company previously transferred to VirnetX and awarded   $368 million   to VirnetX, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated this award. Although VirnetX petitioned the appeals court for an en banc review, this request was denied and the case was remanded to the Federal District Court for further proceedings, including a new jury trial which began on January 25, 2016.  
  On December 17, 2014, VirnetX settled a separate patent infringement dispute with Microsoft Corporation, with those parties executing an Amended Settlement and License Agreement. This agreement amended and restated certain terms of the original Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 14, 2010, between VirnetX and Microsoft. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Microsoft agreed to pay     $23 million     to VirnetX to settle the patent dispute and expand Microsoft's license.     Under its agreements with VirnetX, the Company received proceeds in the second and third quarter of the prior year in the amount of   $10 million  ,   $8 million   of which was received during the third quarter ended October 2, 2015, fr  om VirnetX's settlement with Microsoft and VirnetX's settlement of a previous litigation matter against various defendants, including Mitel, Siemens and Avaya. Pursuant to the agreements with VirnetX, the amount received by the Company includes reimbursement for attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Company in connection with these litigation matters. In addition, the Company is required to pay a royalty on the proceeds received to the customer who paid for the development of the technology.

On February 3, 2016, the jury in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, awarded VirnetX   $626 million   in a verdict against Apple for willful infringement of   four   VirnetX patents. However, on July 29, 2016, the court issued a new order in the pending litigation against Apple, Case No. 6:10-cs-417 ("Apple I") and Case No. 6:12-cv-855 ("Apple II"), vacating its previous order consolidating the two cases and ordering the parties to retry them as separate cases. On September 30, 2016, a jury in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, in the Apple I case, awarded VirnetX   $302 million   in a verdict against Apple for infringing   four   VirnetX patents. A jury trial in the Apple II case is expected to be scheduled by the court shortly after the conclusion of the Apple I case. Under its agreements with VirnetX, Leidos would receive   25%   of the proceeds obtained by VirnetX after reduction for attorneys' fees and costs. However, it is expected that Apple will appeal the verdict and no assurances can be given when or if the Company will receive any proceeds in connection with this jury award. In addition, if the Company receives any   proceeds, the Company is required to pay a royalty to the customer who paid for the development of the technology.    
  The Company does not ha  ve any assets or liabilities recorded in connection with this matter as of September 30, 2016. 
  Government Investigations and Reviews 
  The Company is routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to its role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. Adverse findings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to its reliance on government contracts. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for potential adjustments from audits or reviews of contract costs.  
  Leidos, Inc.'s indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2011 and subsequent fiscal years. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to and including fiscal 2011 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments, and if future adjustments exceed the Company s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected.  
  Leidos Innovations Corporation's indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2009 and subsequent fiscal years. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to and including fiscal 2009 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments, and if future adjustments exceed the Company s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected. 
  Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees 
  The Company has outstanding letters of credit of   $71 million   as of September 30, 2016, principally related to guarantees on contracts. The Company also has outstanding surety bonds in the amount of   $132 million  , principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds on the Company s contracts. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds have various terms with the majority of the letters of credit and bonds expiring over the next five fiscal years. 
  Additionally, the Company has outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of its business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is not aware of any existing event of default that would require it to satisfy any of these guarantees.

  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS GS Business (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). Our third quarter results include the results of the IS GS Business for the period from August 16, 2016, to September 30, 2016. The acquired IS GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment (see "Note 14 Business Segments"). In April 2016, we sold our design, build and heavy construction engineering business. Consequently, the reportable segment of Health and Engineering was renamed as HIS (see "Note 4 Divestitures" and "Note 14 Business Segments"). We now operate in the following segments: National Security Solutions ("NSS"), Health and Infrastructure Sector ("HIS"), Information Systems   Global Solutions ("IS GS") and Corporate and Other. 
   
  Business Environment and Trends  
  U.S. Government Markets 
  For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, we generated approximately 76% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. Government spending, especially national security, homeland security and intelligence spending, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. Government. 
  The following are updates based on events that have occurred in the political and economic environment since the filing of our Transition Report on Form 10-K. 
  In February 2016, the President delivered his requested budget for the government fiscal year ("GFY") 2017 budget cycle to Congress. The Appropriations Committee began its work for the year with the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs advancing its GFY 2017 appropriations bill to the full committee on March 23, 2016. Although a budget resolution has not passed, appropriations bills continue to be discussed and acted upon in committees with many of the 12 appropriations bills in line to be considered by Congress.

Because Congress failed to enact any of the 12 appropriations bills prior to the beginning of GFY 2017, it necessitated the enactment of a short-term continuing resolution. This continuing resolution is in effect until December 9, 2016. Although there are relatively few legislative days left in this session, we anticipate that appropriations for many governmental functions will be finalized in December and that an additional continuing resolution will be needed for the remaining departments where a final resolution has not been agreed upon. There is a possibility of a government shutdown if Congress cannot agree to a long-term budget agreement; however, we believe that is unlikely. 
  International Markets 
  Sales to customers in international markets have historically not been a significant portion of our revenues. Our contract award in the United Kingdom and the acquisition of the IS GS Business have increased the relative contribution from international business and have therefore increased our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks. 
   
  Lockheed Martin Transaction 
  On January 26, 2016, Leidos announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"); Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and, at the time of announcement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin ("Splitco"); and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Leidos would combine with Lockheed Martin s realigned Information Systems   Global Solutions business (the "IS GS Business") in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Lockheed Martin and Splitco entered into a Separation Agreement dated January 26, 2016 (as amended, the "Separation Agreement"), pursuant to which Lockheed Martin would separate the IS GS Business from Lockheed Martin and transfer the IS GS Business to Splitco. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are referred to herein as the  Transactions.  
  On August 16, 2016, we completed the Transactions. In the Transactions, among other steps, (i) Lockheed Martin transferred the IS GS Business to Splitco; (ii) Lockheed Martin offered to Lockheed Martin stockholders the right to exchange all or a portion of their shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Splitco common stock by way of an exchange offer (the "Distribution"); and (iii) Merger Sub merged with and into Splitco, with Splitco as the surviving corporation (the "Merger") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos. Additionally, on the closing date of the Transactions, Splitco's name was changed to Leidos Innovations Corporation. Upon consummation of the Transactions, those Lockheed Martin stockholders who elected to participate in the exchange offer received approximately   77 million   shares of Leidos common stock, which represent approximately   50.5%   of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock after consummation of the Transactions. Holders of Leidos shares prior to the transaction held the remaining approximately   49.5%   of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock immediately after the closing.  
  Prior to the Distribution, Splitco incurred third-party debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of   $1.8 billion   and immediately thereafter, Lockheed Martin transferred the IS GS Business to Splitco and Splitco made a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin of   $1.8 billion  .  
  In connection with the Transactions, Leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed Splitco's indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of   $690 million   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively, and entered into a new   $750 million   senior secured revolving credit facility, which replaced our existing revolving credit facility. See "Note 9 Debt" for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility. 
  In conjunction with the Transactions, our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $13.64 per share of Leidos common stock. On August 22, 2016, we paid   $993 million   to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016. As a result of the special dividend declaration, we accrued   $29 million   of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding equity awards. 
  We expect to incur significant integration costs in connection with the Transactions and related transactions through fiscal 2018. 
  In connection with the Transactions, certain additional agreements were entered into, including, among others an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, an intellectual property matters agreement, agreements relating to certain government contracts matters, supply agreements and certain real estate related agreements.

Key Performance Measures 
  The primary financial performance measures we use to monitor our consolidated results and those of our segments include revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted EPS to manage our consolidated business. In addition, we also monitor bookings and backlog, which are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our potential future revenues. 
  Results of Operations 
  The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented: 

Revenue increases in constant currency   (1)    for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were   44.5%  , and   18.1%  , respectively. The adverse foreign currency impacts were attributable to the NSS segment. 
  Revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include revenues from the recently acquired IS GS Business. See "Note 2 Acquisitions" and the discussion on the IS GS segment below. 
   (1)    The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable period's foreign currency exchange rates. This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

Segment Results 

NSS revenues increased   $43 million  , or   4.9%  , for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended October 2, 2015, and increased   $115 million  , or   4.4%  , for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  
  In constant currency, revenues increased   6.4%   and   5.3%   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The adverse impact of foreign currency was primarily due to the movement of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. 
  The revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency, for both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. These increases were partially offset by reduced revenue due to lower scope and completion of certain contracts. 
  NSS operating income increased   $13 million  , or   16.7%  , for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended October 2, 2015, and increased   $10 million  , or   4.7%  , for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. This increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in fees resulting from profit write-ups on certain contracts. 

HIS revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased   $90 million  , or   21.5%  , as compared to the three months ended October 2, 2015. The revenue decline is primarily attributable to the divestiture of our design, build and heavy construction engineering services business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the revenues from the divested business, HIS revenues increased $25 million, or 8.3%, primarily due to growth in the Federal Health business, partially offset by lower revenues from the sale of security products and our engineering services business. 
  HIS revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased   $67 million  , or   5.7%  , as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The revenue decline is primarily attributable to the divestiture of our design, build and heavy construction engineering services business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and sale of the Plainfield plant, which closed in the second quarter of the prior year. Excluding the revenues from the divested businesses, HIS revenues increased $108 million, or 10.7%, primarily due to growth in the Federal Health business, partially offset by lower revenues from our engineering services business.  
  HIS operating income was   $41 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to operating income of   $13 million   for the three months ended October 2, 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to improved fee performance from our Federal Health business, and decreases in bad debt expense and asset impairment charges. 
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  
  LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. 

HIS operating income was   $116 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an operating loss of   $1 million   for the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to $86 million of asset impairment charges and operating losses associated mainly with the Plainfield plant recorded in the prior year that did not recur in fiscal 2016, along with improved fee performance from our Federal Health business and a decrease in bad debt expense.  

We acquired the IS GS Business on August 16, 2016 (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"), and the business is considered as a separate reportable segment (see "Note 14 Business Segments").  
  The operating results above reflect the IS GS segment performance during the period August 16, 2016 through September 30, 2016. Excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, non-GAAP operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter. 

Corporate and Other revenues decreased   $7 million   and   $5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015, primarily due to proceeds received during the third quarter of the prior year related to the settlement of a litigation matter of   $5 million  . 
  Corporate and Other operating loss represents corporate costs that are not directly related to the operating performance of the reportable segments. 
  Corporate and Other operating loss increased   $60 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended October 2, 2015. The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by acquisition and integration costs incurred related to the Lockheed Martin Transaction of   $44 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and an increase in restructuring charges incurred of   $5 million   in connection with the Transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to severance charges. The increase in operating loss is also attributable to proceeds received related to the settlement of a litigation matter and the sale of buildings of   $8 million   in aggregate for the three months ended October 2, 2015. 
  Corporate and Other operating loss increased   $84 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by acquisition and integration costs incurred related to the Lockheed Martin Transaction of   $68 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and an increase in restructuring charges incurred of   $4 million   in connection with the Transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to severance charges. The increase in operating loss is also attributable to proceeds received related to the settlement of a litigation matter and the sale of buildings of   $13 million   in aggregate for the nine months ended October 2, 2015. 
  Restructuring Expenses 
  After the acquisition of the IS GS Business, we initiated a program to align its cost structure, which included optimization of its real estate portfolio, by vacating facilities that were not necessary for future requirements and reducing headcount. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized   $5 million   of restructuring expenses related to this program. 
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  
  LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, we recognized   $1 million   and   $2 million   of restructuring expenses, respectively, related to the separation of New SAIC and the Company's real estate optimization initiatives. There were   no   restructuring expenses recognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 related to this program. 
  Non-Operating Expense, net 
  Non-operating expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased   $12 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015, primarily due to interest expense on the new   $2.5 billion   term loans secured in connection with the Transactions (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our effective tax rate was   (22.7)%   compared to   38.8%   for the three months ended October 2, 2015. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend, related to the Transactions described within "Note 2 Acquisitions", on shares held by the Leidos retirement plan, an income tax benefit from the resolution of certain tax contingencies with the tax authorities, and a tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance. 
  For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016, our effective tax rate was   12.7%   compared to   29.7%   for the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend on shares held by the Leidos retirement plan and a tax benefit realized for excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions (see discussion of ASU 2016-09 in "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). 
  Bookings and Backlog    
  We received net bookings worth an estimated   $2.9 billion   and   $5.1 billion   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to   $1.5 billion   and   $6.4 billion   for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively. 
  Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements. The estimated value of our total backlog was as follows: 

Total backlog at September 30, 2016 included $454 million of reduction due to the adverse impact of foreign currency movement between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Overview 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $449 million   in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, in August 2016, we entered into a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to   $750 million   in secured borrowing capacity, if required. This new credit facility replaced the previous unsecured credit facility held that provided   $500 million   of borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the credit facilities and we were in compliance with the financial covenants.  
  In August 2016, our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of   $13.64   per share of Leidos common stock. On August 22, 2016, we paid   $993 million   to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016. As a result of the special dividend declaration, we accrued   $29 million   of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding equity awards. In addition, we paid quarterly dividends of   $48 million   and   $94 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  At September 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016, we had outstanding debt of   $3.5 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively. The notes outstanding as of September 30, 2016, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2016.  
  In connection with the Transactions, Leidos has incurred   $2.5 billion   of new indebtedness in the form of term loans (see "Note 2 Acquisitions"). Of the   $2.5 billion  ,   $1.8 billion   of the term loans was secured by Leidos Innovations prior to being acquired and the funds were used to finance the special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The remaining   $690 million   of term loans was secured by Leidos to fund the special cash dividend. On September 30, 2016, the Company repaid   $100 million   of these term loans (see "Note 9 Debt"). 
  In August 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to   $1.2 billion   of the aggregate principal outstanding on the Company's variable rate senior secured notes (see "Note 8 Derivative Instruments"). The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's variable rate secured notes.  
  We anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations:     Cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased   $94 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015, primarily due to pre-funding IS GS expenses in accordance with the transition services agreement with Lockheed Martin, payments for acquisition and integration expenses, timing of collections of receivables and payments to vendors and increased interest payments. 
  Cash Provided by Investing Activities of Continuing Operations:   Cash flows provided by investing activities of continuing operations increased by   $26 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to cash acquired as part of the acquisition of the IS GS Business of $25 million in fiscal 2016 and a payment of   $13 million   in connection with a prior acquisition in the prior year that did not recur in fiscal 2016. 
  Cash Used in Financing Activities of Continuing Operations:   Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations increased   $295 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a special cash dividend payment in connection with the Transactions of   $993 million  , partially

offset by net borrowings of $560 million, the May 2015 accelerated share repurchase of $100 million, and the early retirement of debt of $45 million in the prior year. 
  Cash Provided by Discontinued Operations:     Cash flows provided by discontinued operations decreased   $20 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015, primarily due to an $18 million tax benefit received during the three months ended April 3, 2015, for the conversion of a subsidiary to an LLC. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to guarantees on contracts with foreign government customers and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and payment bonds. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.  
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  On August 16, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the IS GS Business, Leidos, Inc. secured a new term loan of   $690 million   from certain financial institutions. As a result of the acquisition, Leidos assumed the IS GS Business' term loans of   $1.8 billion  , which were obtained by the IS GS Business immediately prior to the Transactions. These senior term loans have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the LIBOR rate plus a margin. Principal is payable on the Company's senior secured notes on a quarterly basis, with the majority of the principal due at maturity. Interest is payable on a periodic basis, which must be at least quarterly. See "Note 9 Debt" for further information regarding the new debt incurred.  
  The following table summarizes, as of September 30, 2016, our obligations to make future payments related to the new debt incurred as stated above as well as the operating lease obligations assumed related to the IS GS Business and provides an estimate of the fiscal years in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: 

(1)    We have excluded purchase orders for services or products to be delivered pursuant to U.S. Government contracts for which we are entitled to full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. 
   (2)    Includes total interest payments on our outstanding debt. Interest payments represent   $19 million  ,   $73 million  ,   $71 million  ,   $66 million   and   $58 million   of the balance for the remainder of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2020, respectively, and   $105 million   of our obligations in fiscal 2021 and thereafter. The total interest payments on the outstanding term loan debt are calculated based on the stated variable rates of the senior secured notes as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  We are subject to a number of reviews, investigations, claims, lawsuits and other uncertainties related to our business. For a discussion of these items, see "Note 15 Legal Proceedings" and "Note 16 Other Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates or judgments that occurred in the quarterly period covered by this report from those discussed in our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We are exposed to certain market rate risks in the normal course of business. Our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. Our risk management policy authorizes, with Board of Directors' approval, the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  On August 16, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the IS GS Business, Leidos, Inc. secured a new term loan of   $690 million   from certain financial institutions. As a result of the acquisition, Leidos assumed the IS GS Business' term loans of   $1.8 billion  , which were obtained by the IS GS Business immediately prior to the Transactions (see "Note 9 Debt"). These senior secured term loans have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the one-month LIBOR rate plus a margin. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in interest expense. In August 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to   $1.2 billion   of the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans (see "Note 8 Derivative Instruments"). The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's variable rate senior secured term loans.  
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  Although the majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our (or one of our subsidiaries') functional currency. Our foreign operations are growing but are not significant and therefore do not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  For further discussion of our market risk associated with interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of January 1, 2016, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Part II of our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. 
   
  Item 4.     Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of Leidos  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016. As permitted by the SEC, the scope of our assessment does not include the IS GS Business that we acquired during the quarter, which represented approximately   26%   of our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2016 and approximately   13%   of our consolidated total assets, excluding the preliminary value of goodwill and intangible assets related to the IS GS Business, as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  On August 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the IS GS Business. In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we excluded IS GS from our evaluation for the third quarter 2016. We are in the process of integrating the IS GS Business into our system of internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Other than the foregoing, there have been no changes in Leidos' internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the quarterly period covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Leidos' internal control over financial reporting.

    Purchases of Equity Securities by the Company  
     In December 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program ("2013 Stock Repurchase Program") under which we may repurchase up to 20 million shares of Leidos common stock. This share repurchase authorization replaced the March 2012 share repurchase authorization of 10 million shares. Stock repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase agreements. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price, corporate capital requirements, other market conditions and regulatory requirements. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the Transactions, we are generally restricted from repurchasing our stock for a two-year period following the closing date of the Transactions, unless an exception applies. 
  The following table presents repurchases of Leidos common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2016:  

(1)   
    The total number of shares purchased includes: (i) shares surrendered to satisfy statutory tax withholdings obligations related to vesting of restricted stock units; and (ii) shares purchased upon surrender by stockholders of previously owned shares in payment of the exercise price of non-qualified stock options and/or to satisfy statutory tax withholdings obligations.  
               (2)   
    We may repurchase up to 20 million shares of Leidos common stock under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program, which was publicly announced in December 2013. No shares were purchased in open market purchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

   49

  SECTION 1.07.        Pro Forma Calculations  . (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this   Section 1.07  ;   provided   that when calculating any such ratio for the purpose of (i) the definition of Applicable Margin or Applicable Percentage, (ii) any mandatory prepayment under   Section 2.10(b)(iii)   or   (iii)   actual compliance with the Financial Covenant, the events set forth in   clauses (b)  ,   (c)   and   (d)   below that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period shall not be given   pro forma   effect. 
  (a)        For purposes of calculating the Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, all Specified Transactions (and the incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness by Holdings or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries and the granting or terminating of any Liens in connection therewith) that have been consummated (i) during the applicable period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which such financial ratio is being determined (the    Test Period   ) or (ii) subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or substantially simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a   pro forma   basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period. 
  (b)        If   pro forma   effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the   pro forma   calculations shall be made in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions (and certified in writing) by a Financial Officer of Holdings and include only those adjustments that are (A) directly attributable to the Specified Transactions with respect to which such adjustments are to be made, (B) factually supportable and reasonably identifiable (in the good faith determination of a Financial Officer of Holdings) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustments referred to above (and subject to the requirements specified therein) may include adjustments that reflect cost savings, operating expense reductions, and synergies as described in   clause (l)   of the definition of  EBITDA ). For the avoidance of doubt, all   pro forma   adjustments shall be consistent with, and subject to, the caps and limits set forth in the applicable definitions herein. To the extent compliance with the Financial Covenant is being tested prior to the first test date under the Financial Covenant, in order to determine permissibility of any action by Holdings or the Restricted Subsidiaries, such compliance shall be tested against the applicable ratio for such first test date.  
  (c)        In the event that Holdings or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness included directly or indirectly in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio or the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility) in the Ordinary Course of Business for working capital purposes) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or substantially simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then the Leverage Ratio and/or the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving   pro forma   effect to such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period. 
  (d)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the terms of this Agreement require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or test (including any Leverage Ratio test, any Senior Secured Leverage Ratio test or the amount of Total Assets or the amount of EBITDA) or (ii) the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) as a condition to the  
  
   50 

making of any Limited Condition Acquisition or incurrence of Indebtedness in connection therewith, the determination of whether the relevant condition is satisfied may be made, at the election of the Borrower, at the time of (or on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to such Limited Condition Acquisition or (y) the consummation of the Limited Condition Acquisition and related incurrence of Indebtedness, in each case, after giving effect to the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition and related incurrence of Indebtedness, on a   pro forma   basis;   provided   that notwithstanding the foregoing, the absence of an Event of Default under   Section 7.01(a)   or   (e)   shall be a condition to the consummation of any such Limited Condition Acquisition and incurrence of Indebtedness. If the Borrower has made such an election to test at the time of the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to such Limited Condition Acquisition, then, in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or test on or following the relevant determination date, and prior to the earlier of (x) the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated or (y) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such ratio or test shall be calculated on (A) a   pro forma   basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition or any transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness, Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) has been consummated, and also on (B) a standalone basis without giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and any such transactions in connection therewith. In addition, if the proceeds of an Incremental Commitment are to be used to finance a Limited Condition Acquisition, then at the option of the Borrower and subject to the agreement of the lenders providing such financing, the commitments in respect thereof may be subject to customary  SunGard  conditionality.  
  (e)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that does not require compliance with a financial ratio (any such amounts, the    Fixed Amounts   ) substantially concurrently with any such amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with a financial ratio (including   Section 6.15   hereof, any Senior Secured Leverage Ratio test or any Leverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the    Ratio-Based Amounts   ), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to any substantially concurrent utilization of the Ratio-Based Amounts;   provided   that the foregoing shall not apply to Restricted Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test, at all times prior to the first delivery of financial statements pursuant to   Section 5.08(a)   or   (b)  , compliance shall be determined based on the   pro forma   consolidated financial statements of Holdings delivered pursuant to   Section 3.01(j)   hereof. 
  SECTION 1.08.        Classification of Loans and Borrowings  . For purposes of this Agreement, Loans may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a  Revolving Credit Loan ) or by Type (e.g., a  Eurocurrency Rate Loan ) or by Class and Type (e.g., a  Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Credit Loan ). Borrowings also may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a  Revolving Credit Borrowing ) or by Type (e.g., a  Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing ) or by Class and Type (e.g., a  Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Credit Borrowing ).

Amounts borrowed in respect of the Term Loans and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The initial Term Borrowing shall consist of Term Loans made simultaneously by the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective initial Term Commitments.  
  (b)        The Revolving Credit Loans  . Each Revolving Credit Lender severally (and not jointly) agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Revolving Credit Loans in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date in an amount not to exceed such Revolving Credit Lender s Unused Revolving Credit Commitment;   provided   that in no event shall (x) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans made on the Closing Date (including any such advances used to finance the Transactions) exceed $200,000,000 and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans made on the Closing Date that are used to finance the Transactions exceed $50,000,000. Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an amount not less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum or the Revolving Credit Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof and shall consist of Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type made on the same day by the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably according to their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower may borrow under this   Section 2.01(b)  , prepay pursuant to   Section 2.10   and reborrow under this   Section 2.01(b)  . 
  (c)        Letters of Credit  . (i) Each Issuing Bank agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Agreement, to issue Letters of Credit (which shall not, unless otherwise agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank, be trade or commercial letters of credit) (each, a    Letter of Credit   ) denominated in Dollars (or, subject to   Section 1.05  , any other currency) for the account of Holdings, the Borrower and the other Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until 5 Business Days before the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date in an aggregate Stated Amount (i) for all Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank not to exceed at any time the lesser of (x) the Letter of Credit Facility at such time and (y) such Issuing Bank s Letter of Credit Commitment at such time, (ii) for each such Letter of Credit not to exceed an amount equal to the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at such time and (iii) for all Letters of Credit issued by all Issuing Banks not to exceed at any time the Letter of Credit Facility. Within the limits referred to above, the Borrower may from time to time request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this   Section 2.01(c)  . 
  (ii)        No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of (x) 5 Business Days before the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date and (y) one year after the date of Issuance thereof (or such longer period agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion which in no event shall extend beyond the date referred to in   clause (x)   above), but may by its terms be renewable annually automatically or upon written notice (a    Notice of Renewal   ) given to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Agent on or prior to any date for Notice of Renewal set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any event at least three Business Days prior to the date of the expiration of such Letter of Credit (or such shorter period as the Issuing Bank shall agree);   provided  , that the terms of each Letter of Credit that is automatically renewable annually (   Auto-Extension Letter of Credit   ) shall permit the applicable Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the  
  
   52 

beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the    Non-Extension Notice Date   ) in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than five Business Days before the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date;   provided  ,   however  , that such Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (A) such Issuing Bank has reasonably determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit (as extended) under the terms hereof, or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   Section 3.02   is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such Issuing Bank not to permit such extension. 
  (d)        Each Lender having an Incremental Term Commitment, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees, subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties set forth herein and in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, to make Incremental Term Loans to the Borrower, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed its Incremental Term Commitment. Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Incremental Term Loans may not be reborrowed. 
  SECTION 2.02.        Making the Loans  . (a) Except as otherwise provided in   Section 2.03(c)  , each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day (in the case of the proposed Borrowing to be made on the Closing Date, 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) one Business Day (or such shorter period as is approved by the Agent)) prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (y) noon (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Loans, by the Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Appropriate Lender prompt notice thereof by fax or e-mail. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a    Notice of Borrowing   ) shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or fax in substantially the form of   Exhibit B   hereto (or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Agent), specifying therein the requested (i) date and Facility of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Loans comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, initial Interest Period. Each Appropriate Lender shall (1) before noon (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (2) before 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Loans, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agent s Account, in same day funds, such Lender s ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agent s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in   Article III  , the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent s address referred to in   Section 9.02   or at the applicable Payment Office, as the case may be. 
  (b)        Anything in   subsection (a)   above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than the Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall then be suspended pursuant to   Section 2.08   or   2.12  , and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Loans may not be outstanding as part of more than six separate Term Borrowings and ten separate Revolving Credit Borrowings. 
  (c)        Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing  
  
   53 

for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth herein, including any loss (including loss of margin), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Loan to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. 
  (d)        Unless the Agent shall have received notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with   subsection (a)   of this   Section 2.02   and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender s Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 
  (e)        The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to   Section 9.04(c)   are several and not joint. The failure of any Appropriate Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under   Section 9.04(c)   on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Appropriate Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Loan or to make its payment under   Section 9.04(c)  . 
  SECTION 2.03.        Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit  . (a)   Request for Issuance  . (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later than noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Issuance of such Letter of Credit (or on such shorter notice as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree), by the Borrower to any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall give the Agent, prompt notice thereof. Each such notice by the Borrower of an Issuance of a Letter of Credit (a    Notice of Issuance   ) shall, if required by the applicable Issuing Bank, be accompanied by a letter of credit application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer (or designee thereof) of the Borrower and may be sent by fax, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by such Issuing Bank, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to such Issuing Bank, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such Issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued pursuant to such form of an application and agreement for issuance or amendment of a letter of credit as is used from time to time by such Issuing Bank (a    Letter of Credit Agreement   ). If the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its reasonable discretion (it being understood and agreed that any such form shall have only explicit documentary conditions to draw and shall not include discretionary conditions), such Issuing Bank shall, unless such Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Lender or the Agent, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of Issuance of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in   Section 3.02   shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, on the requested date, Issue a Letter of Credit for the account of Holdings, the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case in accordance with such Issuing Bank s usual and customary business practices. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit Issuance as such Issuing Bank or  
  
   54 

the Agent may reasonably require. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Issuing Banks may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
  (ii) The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of non-compliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable Issuing Bank. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
  (b)        Participations  . By the Issuance of a Letter of Credit (including an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing or decreasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Credit Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Credit Lender, and each Revolving Credit Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Ratable Share of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay in Dollars to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender s Ratable Share of each drawing (or the Ratable Share of the Equivalent in Dollars of any such drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars) made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date required under   Section 2.03(c)  , or of any reimbursement payment thereafter required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, which amount will be advanced, and deemed to be a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower hereunder, regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in   Section 3.02  . Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Credit Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender s Ratable Share of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment is amended pursuant to an assignment in accordance with   Section 9.07   or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement and at each time the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit is adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof. 
  (c)        Drawing and Reimbursement  . (i) The payment by an Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit which is not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date made shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of a Revolving Credit Loan, which shall be a Base Rate Loan, in the amount of such draft (or the Equivalent in Dollars of any such draft for a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars), without regard to whether the making of such a Loan would exceed such Issuing Bank s Unused Revolving Credit Commitment. Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Borrower and the Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the first Business Day following any such drawing, which reimbursement shall be through the Agent and (x) in Dollars (in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars) or (y) in the applicable currency (in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars), unless in the case of this   clause (y)   such Issuing Bank (at its sole option) notifies the Borrower that it shall require reimbursement in Dollars (and the amount equal to the Equivalent in Dollars of the amount of such  
  
   55 

drawing), in which case such reimbursement shall be in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank by such time, the Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the amount of the unreimbursed drawing, and the amount of such Lender s Ratable Share in Dollars thereof (or Ratable Share of the Equivalent in Dollars of any such drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars). Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to the applicable Issuing Bank. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share in Dollars of an outstanding Revolving Credit Loan made by an Issuing Bank as aforesaid on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank;   provided   that notice of such demand is given not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Loan available to the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount (together with interest thereon for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such Issuing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation). A certificate of an Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this   Section 2.03(c)   shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

If any Appropriate Lender does not give a notice to the Agent on or prior to such date informing the Agent that it declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be paid to the Agent by the Borrower and applied by the Agent in accordance with   Section 2.10(b)(vi)   (other than Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders).

  (ix)        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this   Section 2.10(b)  , to the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary (a    Foreign Disposition   ) gives rise to a prepayment event pursuant to   Section 2.10(b)(v)  , or Excess Cash Flow giving rise to a prepayment event pursuant to   Section 2.10(b)(iii)   (solely to the extent related to Excess Cash Flow generated by Foreign Subsidiaries), are or is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, (A) the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to prepay Term Loans at the times provided in this   Section 2.10(b)   but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (and Holdings and the Borrower hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.10(b)   to the extent provided herein and (B) to the extent that Holdings and the Borrower have determined in good faith (and after use of commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such material adverse tax cost consequences) that repatriation of any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition, or Excess Cash Flow (solely to the extent related to Excess Cash Flow generated by Foreign Subsidiaries) would have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary;   provided   that, in the case of this   clause (B)  , on or before the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to this   Section 2.10(b)  , (x) the Borrowers shall apply an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated or (y) such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary. 
  SECTION 2.11.        Increased Costs  . (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
  
   64 

(i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate); 
  (ii)        subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in   clauses (b)   through   (d)   of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement, Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  
  (b)        Capital Adequacy  . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s Parent Company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s Parent Company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement  . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its Parent Company as specified in   paragraph (a)   or   (b)   of this   Section 2.11   and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)        Delay in Requests  . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this   Section 2.11   shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this   Section 2.11   for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  SECTION 2.12.        Illegality  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender under any Facility shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations  
  
   65 

hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (a) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan will automatically, upon such demand, be Converted into a Base Rate Loan and (b) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to Convert Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
  SECTION 2.13.        Payments and Computations  . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars (or, in the case of reimbursement of a draft drawn under a Letter of Credit, in accordance with and in the currency required under   Section 2.03(c)  ) to the Agent at the applicable Agent s Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.04(b)(ii)  ,   2.04(c)  ,   2.11  ,   2.14   or   9.04  ) to the applicable Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to   Section 9.07(c)  , from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. 
  (b)        [Reserved.] 
  (c)        All computations of interest based on Citibank s base rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or One Month LIBOR and of fees and Letter of Credit fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be;   provided  ,   however  , that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
  (e)        Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each applicable Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each applicable Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
  
   66 

SECTION 2.14.        Taxes  . (a)   Payments Free of Taxes  . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 2.14  ) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  (b)        Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties  . The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
  (c)        Indemnification by the Loan Parties  . The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section 2.14  ) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount being requested, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Indemnification by the Lenders  . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 9.07(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this   paragraph (d)  . 
  (e)        Evidence of Payments  . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this   Section 2.14  , such Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 
  (f)        Status of Recipients  . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit  
  
   67 

such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation by any Lender (other than such documentation set forth in   Sections 2.14(f)(ii)(A)  ,   (ii)(B)   and   (ii)(D)   below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  (ii)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
  (A)        any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  (B)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (i)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W 8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (ii)        executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
  (iii)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit D-1   to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a    U.S  .   Tax Compliance Certificate   ) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or 
  (iv)        to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit D-2   or   Exhibit D-3  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if  
  
   68 

the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit D-4   on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner; 
  (C)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)        if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this   clause (D)  ,    FATCA    shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  The Agent and each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (g)        Treatment of Certain Refunds  . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this   Section 2.14   (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.14  ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this   Section 2.14   with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this   paragraph (g)   (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   paragraph (g)  , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this   paragraph (g)   the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make  
  
   69 

available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
  (h)        Survival  . Each party s obligations under this   Section 2.14   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
  (i)        Interpretation  . For purposes of this   Section 2.14  , the term  applicable law  includes FATCA. 
  SECTION 2.15.        Sharing of Payments, Etc  . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its   pro rata   share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;   provided   that: 
  (i)        if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
  (ii)        the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). 
  Each of Holdings and the Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against Holdings and the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Holdings and the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
  SECTION 2.16.        Evidence of Debt  . (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Loans. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Loans owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns) in a principal amount up to (x) in the case of a Term Note, the sum of the then-applicable Commitment of such Lender and the applicable Loans owing to such Lender and (y) in the case of a Revolving Credit Note, the applicable Commitment of such Lender. 
  
   70 

(b)        The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to   Section 9.07(c)   shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Loans comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender s share thereof. 
  (c)        Entries made in good faith by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to   section (a)   above shall be   prima facie   evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement, absent manifest error;   provided  ,   however  , that the failure of such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement; and   provided  ,   further  , that in the event of any conflict between the Register and the Lender s account or accounts, the Register shall govern. 
  SECTION 2.17.        Use of Proceeds  . 
  (a)        Revolving Credit Loans  . Subject to   Section 5.09  , the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for working capital and general corporate purposes of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries;   provided   that Revolving Credit Loans made on the Closing Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50,000,000 may be used to finance the Transactions. 
  (b)        Subject to   Section 5.09  , the proceeds of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely to finance the Transactions.  
  SECTION 2.18.        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  . 
  (a)        Designation of a Different Lending Office  . If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.11  , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.14  , then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.11   or   2.14  , as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  (b)        Replacement of Lenders  . If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.11  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.14   and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Applicable Lending Office in accordance with   Section 2.18(a)  , or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Approving Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 9.07  ), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to   Section 2.11   or   Section 2.14  ) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an  
  
   71 

Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that: 
  (i)        the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in   Section 9.07  ; 
  (ii)        such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Letters of Credit (if any), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under   Section 9.04(f)  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (iii)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.11   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.14  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
  (iv)        such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and 
  (v)        in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Approving Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  (c)        A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  SECTION 2.19.        Cash Collateral  . At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, within two Business Days following the written request of the Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks  Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to any reallocation pursuant to   Section 2.20(a)   and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.

Any payments, prepayments  
  
   73 

or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this   Section 2.20(a)(ii)   shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)        Certain Fees  . (A) No Defaulting Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be entitled to receive a commitment fee pursuant to   Section 2.04(a)   for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.

Subject to   Section 9.19  , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)        Cash Collateral  . If and for so long as the reallocation described in   clause (iv)   above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks  Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in   Section 2.19  .

funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held   pro rata   by the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving effect to   Section 2.20(a)(iv)  ), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and   provided  ,   further  , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  (c)        New Letters of Credit  . So long as any Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to Issue or increase any Letter of Credit unless (i) it is satisfied that the related Fronting Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders (including by allocating participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with   Section 2.20(a)(iv)   (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein)) or (ii) Cash Collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with   Section 2.19  .

  (d)        Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Agent may, in consultation with the Borrower, take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all Incremental Loans (other than Specified Incremental Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans, as applicable, on a   pro rata   basis. This may be accomplished by, among other things, requiring each outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing to be Converted into a Base Rate Borrowing on the date of such Incremental Loan, or by allocating a portion of such Incremental Loan to each outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing under the relevant Facility on a   pro rata   basis. Any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans required by the preceding sentence shall be subject to   Section 9.04(f)  . If any Incremental Loan is to be allocated to an existing Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing, then the interest rate thereon for such Interest Period and the other economic consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement. In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are Term Loans, the scheduled amortization payments under   Section 2.06(c)  , required to be made after the making of such Incremental Term Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incremental Term Commitments to make Specified Incremental Term Loans may not be requested without the prior written consent of the Agent if, as a result of the Specified Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder, there would be more than five classes of Term Loans and Specified Incremental Term Loans outstanding. 
  
   81 

(e)        Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, each Loan Document may be modified, supplemented, amended and/or amended and restated by the Agent and the Borrower without the action or consent of any other party, if the Agent determines it to be necessary or advisable, to provide for terms applicable to any Incremental Loans permitted by or to otherwise give effect to this   Section 2.23  . Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Commitments and the Incremental Loans evidenced thereby.

Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, but without limiting the rights of any Lender, Issuing Bank or any of their respective Affiliates under   Section 9.05  , each Loan Party, the Agent and each Lender hereby agree that no Lender, in its capacity as such, shall have any right individually to realize upon any collateral subject to any Security and Guarantee Documents, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder or thereunder may be exercised solely by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, as applicable.  
  Section 8.02.        Rights as a Lender  . The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any member of the Consolidated Group or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
  
   122 

Section 8.03.        Duties of Agent; Exculpatory Provisions  . (a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: 
  (i)        shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  (ii)        shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);   provided   that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and 
  (iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
  (b)        The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in   Sections 9.01   and   7.01  ), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Borrower or a Lender. 
  (c)        The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in   Article III   or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent. 
  Section 8.04.        Reliance by Agent  . The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the Closing Date, the making of a Loan or the Issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have  
  
   123 

received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the occurrence of the Closing Date, the making of such Loan or such Issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  Section 8.05.        Delegation of Duties  . The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as Agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
  Section 8.06.        Resignation of Agent  . (a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Resignation Effective Date   ), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  (b)        If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to   clause (vi)   of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Removal Effective Date   ) then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
  (c)        With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders hereunder, the retiring or removed Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent), and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The annual administrative fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such  
  
   124 

successor. After the retiring or removed Agent s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and   Section 9.04   shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent. 
  (d)        Any resignation pursuant to this   Section 8.06   by a Person also acting as an Issuing Bank shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance or issue new, or extend existing, Letters of Credit where such advance, issuance or extension is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, (ii) the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
  Section 8.07.        Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders  . Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
  Section 8.08.        No Other Duties, Etc  .

  Section 8.09.        Agent May File Proofs of Claim  . In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
  (a)        to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Agent under   Sections 2.04   and   9.04  ) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
  (b)        to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Agent and, in the event that the Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Agent  
  
   125 

any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agent and its respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Agent under   Sections 2.04   and   9.04  . 
  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. 
  Section 8.10.        Collateral and Guaranty Matters  .

  (b)        to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by   Sections 6.01(b)   and   (d)  ; and

make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable   pro rata   share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full   pro rata   share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Ratable Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with   paragraph (d)   of this   Section 9.07  . 
  (c)        Register  . The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  (d)        Participations  .

The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.11  ,   9.04(f)   and   2.14   (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under   Section 2.14(f)   (it being understood and agreed that the documentation required under   Section 2.14(f)   shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   paragraph (b)   of this   Section 9.07  ;   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of   Section 2.18   as if it were an assignee under   paragraph (b)   of this   Section 9.07  ; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Sections 2.11   or   2.14  , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of   Section 2.18   with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 9.05   as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.15   as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)        Certain Pledges  . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this   Section 9.08   shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
  Section 9.09.        Governing Law  . This Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except, as to any other Loan Document, as expressly set forth therein) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. 
  Section 9.10.        Execution in Counterparts  . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by fax or email shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
  Section 9.11.        Judgment  . (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at Citibank s principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. 
  (b)        The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the    Primary Currency   ) to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency,  
  
   138 

the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess. 
  Section 9.12.        Jurisdiction, Etc  . (a)   Jurisdiction  . Each of Holdings and the Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank, or any Related Party of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
  (b)        Waiver of Venue  . Each of Holdings and the Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in   paragraph (a)   of this   Section 9.12  . Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
  (c)        Service of Process  . Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in   Section 9.02  . Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. 
  Section 9.13.        No Liability of the Issuing Banks  . The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither an Issuing Bank nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the failure to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the applicable Letter of Credit); (c) validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (d) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or (e) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not special, indirect consequential or punitive, damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment) were caused by such Issuing Bank s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. In furtherance and  
  
   139 

not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary;   provided   that nothing herein shall be deemed to excuse such Issuing Bank if it acts with bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment) in accepting such documents. 
  Section 9.14.        Patriot Act Notice  . Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Holdings and the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each of Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, which information includes the name and address of each of Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lenders in order to assist the Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act. 
  Section 9.15.        Other Relationships; No Fiduciary Duty  . No relationship created hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall in any way affect the ability of the Agent and each Lender to enter into or maintain business relationships with Holdings, the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof beyond the relationships specifically contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of Holdings and the Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, Holdings, the Borrower, their respective subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any advisory, equitable or fiduciary duties on the part of the Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, and no such duties will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. Each of Holdings and the Borrower also hereby agrees that none of the Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates have advised and are advising Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates as to any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax matters, and that each of Holdings and the Borrower is consulting its own advisors concerning such matters to the extent it deems appropriate. 
  Section 9.16.        WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  . EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS   SECTION 9.16  . 
  Section 9.17.        Interest Rate Limitation  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the    Maximum Rate   ). If the Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be  
  
   140 

applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Loan Document Obligations hereunder. 
  Section 9.18.        Intercreditor Agreement  . Each of the Lenders and the other Secured Parties (a) acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Leidos/Spinco Intercreditor Agreement, (b) consents to the terms of the Leidos/Spinco Intercreditor Agreement, (c) authorizes and instructs the Agent to enter into the Leidos/Spinco Intercreditor Agreement or other intercreditor agreements (and any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, such agreements in connection with the incurrence by any Loan Party of any Indebtedness of such Loan Party that is permitted to be secured by the Collateral pursuant to   Section 6.01   of this Agreement, in order to permit such Indebtedness to be secured by a valid, perfected Lien (with such priority as may be designated by such Loan Party, to the extent such priority is permitted by the Loan Documents)) as collateral agent and on behalf of such Person, and by its acceptance of the benefits of the Security and Guarantee Documents, hereby acknowledges that the Leidos/Spinco Intercreditor Agreement and any such other intercreditor agreement is or will be, as applicable, binding upon it and (d) agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of the Leidos/Spinco Intercreditor Agreement or such other intercreditor agreements (and any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, such agreements in connection with the incurrence by any Loan Party of any Indebtedness of such Loan Party that is permitted to be secured by the Collateral pursuant to   Section 6.01   of this Agreement, in order to permit such Indebtedness to be secured by a valid, perfected Lien (with such priority as may be designated by such Loan Party, to the extent such priority is permitted by the Loan Documents)), and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof. 
  Section 9.19.        Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto or to any other Loan Document, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution (as defined below) arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write Down and Conversion Powers (as defined below) of an EEA Resolution Authority (as defined below) and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: 
  (a)        the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and 
  (b)        the effects of any Bail-in Action (as defined below) on any such liability, including, if applicable: 
  (i)        a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
  (ii)        a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will  
  
   141 

be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
  (iii)        the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.

  (b)        Anything in   subsection (a)   above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than the Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall  
  
   48 
  [[3596554]] 

then be suspended pursuant to   Section 2.08   or   2.12  , and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Loans may not be outstanding as part of more than six separate Borrowings. 
  (c)        Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth herein, including any loss (including loss of margin), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Loan to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. 
  (d)        Unless the Agent shall have received notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with   subsection (a)   of this   Section 2.02   and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender s Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 
  (e)        The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to   Section 9.04(c)   are several and not joint. The failure of any Appropriate Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under   Section 9.04(c)   on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Appropriate Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Loan or to make its payment under   Section 9.04(c)  .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any prepayments otherwise required to be made pursuant to the above provisions of this   clause (v)   shall not be required to be made in respect of the first $100,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds received by the Borrower in respect of Asset Sales after the Closing Date  ;   provided   that this sentence shall not apply with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds received by the Borrower in respect an Asset Sale if all or any portion thereof are applied to prepay or repurchase any Leidos Loans and/or any Other Applicable Indebtedness.

   54 
  [[3596554]] 

outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans, and then the applied   pro rata   to the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans under   Section 2.06  . 
  (vii)        The Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, at the time of each prepayment required under   Sections 2.10(b)(iii)  ,   (iv)   and   (v)   above, (i) a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of Holdings setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such prepayment (the    Prepayment Amount   ) and (ii) at least three Business Days  prior written notice of such prepayment. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date (the    Prepayment Date   ), the Type of each Loan being prepaid and the principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid.

In addition to the notice requirements in   Section 2.10(b)(vii)  , each such notice of any event giving rise to a prepayment under   Section 2.10(b)(iii)   or   (v)   shall also specify whether or not the Borrower has elected to give the Term Lenders the option to decline such prepayment. If the Borrower has elected to allow the Term Lenders to decline to accept such prepayment, any Appropriate Lender may decline to accept all (but not less than all) of its share of any such prepayment (any such Lender, a    Declining Lender   ) by providing written notice to the Agent no later than one Business Day after the date of such Appropriate Lender s receipt of notice from the Agent regarding such prepayment. If any Appropriate Lender does not give a notice to the Agent on or prior to such date informing the Agent that it declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be paid to the Agent by the Borrower and applied by the Agent in accordance with   Section 2.10(b)(vi)   (other than Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders). Any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders shall be retained by the Borrower (such amounts,    Declined Spinco Amounts    and together with any Declined Leidos Amounts (as defined in the Leidos Credit Agreement),    Declined Amounts   ). 
  (ix)        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this   Section 2.10(b)  , to the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary (a    Foreign Disposition   ) gives rise to a prepayment event pursuant to   Section 2.10(b)(v)  , or Excess Cash Flow giving rise to a prepayment event pursuant to   Section 2.10(b)(iii)   (solely to the extent related to Excess Cash Flow generated by Foreign Subsidiaries), are or is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, (A) the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to prepay Term Loans at the times provided in this   Section 2.10(b)   but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (and Holdings and the Borrower hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.10(b)   to the extent provided herein and (B) to the extent that Holdings and the Borrower have determined in good faith (and after use of commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such material adverse tax cost consequences) that repatriation of any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition, or Excess Cash Flow (solely to the extent related to Excess Cash Flow generated by Foreign Subsidiaries) would have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, the Net Cash  
  
   55 
  [[3596554]] 

Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary  ;   provided   that, in the case of this   clause (B)  , on or before the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to this   Section 2.10(b)  , (x) the Borrowers shall apply an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated or (y) such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary. 
  SECTION 2.11.        Increased Costs  . (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate); 
  (ii)        subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in   clauses (b)   through   (d)   of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement, Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  
  (b)        Capital Adequacy.   If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s Parent Company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s Parent Company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s Parent Company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement.   A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its Parent Company as specified in   paragraph (a)   or   (b)   of this   Section 2.11   and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d)        Delay in Requests.   Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this   Section 2.11   shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation  ;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this   Section 2.11   for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  SECTION 2.12.        Illegality  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender under any Facility shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (a) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan will automatically, upon such demand, be Converted into a Base Rate Loan and (b) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to Convert Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
  SECTION 2.13.        Payments and Computations  . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent s Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.04  ,   2.11  ,   2.14   or   9.04  ) to the applicable Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to   Section 9.07(c)  , from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. 
  (b)        [Reserved.] 
  (c)        All computations of interest based on Citibank s base rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or One Month LIBOR and of fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be  ;   provided  ,   however  , that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal  
  
   57 
  [[3596554]] 

of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
  (f)        Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each applicable Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each applicable Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
  SECTION 2.14.        Taxes  . (a)   Payments Free of Taxes.   Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 2.14  ) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  (b)        Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties.   The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
  (c)        Indemnification by the Loan Parties.   The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section 2.14  ) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount being requested, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Indemnification by the Lenders.   Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 9.07(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any  
  
   58 
  [[3596554]] 

and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this   paragraph (d)  . 
  (e)        Evidence of Payments.   As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this   Section 2.14  , such Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 
  (f)        Status of Recipients.   (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation by any Lender (other than such documentation set forth in   Sections 2.14(f)(ii)(A)  ,   (ii)(B)   and   (ii)(D)   below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  (ii)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
  (A)        any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  (B)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (i)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W 8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (ii)        executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
  
   59

  (iv)        to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit D-2   or   Exhibit D-3  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable  ;   provided   that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit D-4   on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner; 
  (C)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)        if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this   clause (D)  ,    FATCA    shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  The Agent and each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (g)        Treatment of Certain Refunds.   If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant  
  
   60 
  [[3596554]] 

to this   Section 2.14   (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.14  ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this   Section 2.14   with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this   paragraph (g)   (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   paragraph (g)  , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this   paragraph (g)   the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
  (h)        Survival.   Each party s obligations under this   Section 2.14   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
  (i)        Interpretation.   For purposes of this   Section 2.14  , the term  applicable law  includes FATCA. 
  SECTION 2.15.        Sharing of Payments, Etc  . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its   pro rata   share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;   provided   that: 
  (i)        if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
  (ii)        the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply), except for assignments to the Borrower made pursuant to Dutch auctions and open market purchases as provided in   Section 9.07(b)(v)  . 
  Each of Holdings and the Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing  
  
   61 
  [[3596554]] 

arrangements may exercise against Holdings and the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Holdings and the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
  SECTION 2.16.        Evidence of Debt  . (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Loans. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Loans owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns) in a principal amount up to the sum of the then-applicable Commitment of such Lender and the applicable Loans owing to such Lender. 
  (b)        The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to   Section 9.07(c)   shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Loans comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender s share thereof. 
  (c)        Entries made in good faith by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to   section (a)   above shall be   prima facie   evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement, absent manifest error  ;   provided  ,   however  , that the failure of such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement; and   provided  ,   further  ,   that in the event of any conflict between the Register and the Lender s account or accounts, the Register shall govern. 
  SECTION 2.17.        Use of Proceeds  . Subject to   Section 5.09  , the proceeds of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely to make the Spinco Special Cash Payment and to pay certain fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Transactions.  
  SECTION 2.18.        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  . 
  (a)        Designation of a Different Lending Office.   If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.11  , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.14  , then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.11   or   2.14  , as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  
   62 
  [[3596554]] 

(b)        Replacement of Lenders.   If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.11  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.14   and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Applicable Lending Office in accordance with   Section 2.18(a)  , or if any Lender is a Non-Approving Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 9.07  ), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to   Section 2.11   or   Section 2.14  ) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment)  ;   provided   that: 
  (i)        the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in   Section 9.07  ; 
  (ii)        such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under   Section 9.04(f)   and, if applicable, under   Section 2.10(a)(ii)  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees (other than any prepayment premium)) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (iii)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.11   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.14  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
  (iv)        such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and 
  (v)        in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Approving Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  (c)        A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Such notice shall set forth (x) the amount of the Incremental Term Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or such lesser amount equal to the remaining Incremental Facility Amount, as applicable), (y) the date on which such Incremental Term Commitments are requested to become effective and (z) whether such Incremental Term Commitments are (i) commitments to make additional B Term Loans (which commitments shall only be permitted if such additional B Term Loans are fungible for United States Federal income tax purposes with the existing B Term Loans) or (ii) commitments to make new B Type Term Loans (as defined below) with terms different from the B Term Loans (such loans,    Specified Incremental Term Loans    and such commitments    Specified Incremental Term Commitments   ).

   67 
  [[3596554]] 

initially made at a discount or the Lenders making the same receive a fee directly or indirectly from Holdings or any of the Subsidiaries for doing so (but excluding the effect of any bona fide arrangement, structuring, syndication or other fees payable in connection therewith that are not shared with all lenders or holders thereof) (the amount of such discount or fee, expressed as a percentage of such Loans, being referred to herein as    OID   ), the amount of such OID divided by the lesser of (x) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Loans and (y) four) exceeds by more than 50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the    Yield Differential   ) the   sum   of (x) the Applicable Margin then in effect for Eurocurrency Rate B Term Loans, and (y) the amount of the OID initially paid in respect of the B Term Loans,   divided by   four, then the Applicable Margin then in effect for B Term Loans shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the making of such Specified Incremental Term Loans and (2) the other terms of any Specified Incremental Term Loans shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. For purposes of this   Section 2.23  ,    B Type Term Loans    means any term loans which (w) have scheduled amortization not to exceed 1.00%   per annum  , (x) have a final maturity of greater than five years, (y) are secured by some or all of the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Obligations and Obligations (as defined in the Leidos Credit Agreement) and (z) are guaranteed by some or all of the Guarantors. 
  (c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Commitment shall become effective under this   Section 2.23   unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, (A)(1) the representations and warranties contained in   Article IV   are true and correct in all material respects (except for those representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, which shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such date, as though made on and as of such date except where such representations and warranties expressly refers to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such earlier date and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (and the Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of Holdings); and (B) Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be in compliance with the Financial Covenant after giving   pro forma   effect to the incurrence of such Incremental Term Commitments, the making of Loans to be made on the date of effectiveness thereof, any Permitted Acquisition consummated simultaneously therewith, and the   pro forma   adjustments described in   Section 1.07  , (ii) all fees and expenses owing to the Agent and the Lenders in respect of such Incremental Term Commitment shall have been paid in full, (iii) to the extent not consistent with this Agreement, the other terms and documentation in respect of the Incremental Term Loans shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent unless otherwise expressly permitted in this   Section 2.23   and (iv) except as otherwise specified in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, the Agent shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions and other closing certificates reasonably requested by the Agent and consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date. 
  (d)        Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Agent may, in consultation with the Borrower, take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all Incremental Term Loans (other than Specified Incremental Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding B Term Loans on a   pro rata   basis. This may be accomplished by, among other things, requiring each outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing to be Converted into a Base Rate Borrowing on the date of such Incremental Term Loan, or by allocating a portion of such Incremental Term Loan to each outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing under the relevant Facility on a   pro rata   basis. Any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans required by the preceding sentence shall be subject to   Section 9.04(f)  . If any Incremental Term Loan is to be allocated to an existing Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing, then the interest rate thereon for such Interest Period and the other economic consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement. In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are B Term Loans, the scheduled amortization payments under   Section 2.06 
  
   68 
  [[3596554]] 

(c)  , required to be made after the making of such Incremental Term Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incremental Term Commitments to make Specified Incremental Term Loans may not be requested without the prior written consent of the Agent if, as a result of the Specified Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder, there would be more than five classes of Term Loans and Specified Incremental Term Loans outstanding. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, each Loan Document may be modified, supplemented, amended and/or amended and restated by the Agent and the Borrower without the action or consent of any other party, if the Agent determines it to be necessary or advisable, to provide for terms applicable to any Incremental Term Loans permitted by or to otherwise give effect to this   Section 2.23  . Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Commitments and the Incremental Term Loans evidenced thereby.

ARTICLE VIII       THE AGENT 
  SECTION 8.01.        Authorization and Authority  . (a) Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Citibank to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  agent  herein or in any Loan Document (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
  (b)        The Agent shall also act as the Secured Parties Collateral Agent and the Non-Notes Secured Parties Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in each such Lender s capacity as a potential Cash Management Bank and/or Hedge Bank) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Agent, as the Secured Parties Collateral Agent and the Non-Notes Secured Parties Collateral Agent, and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Agent pursuant to   Section 8.05   for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security and Guarantee Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this   Article VIII   and of   paragraphs (a)  ,   (b)   and   (c)   of   Section 9.04   (as though such agent, co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, but without limiting the rights of any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates under   Section 9.05  , each Loan Party, the Agent and each Lender hereby agree that no Lender, in its capacity as such, shall have any right individually to realize upon any collateral subject to any Security and Guarantee Documents, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder or thereunder may be exercised solely by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, as applicable.  
  SECTION 8.02.        Rights as a Lender  . The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any member of the Consolidated Group or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
  SECTION 8.03.        Duties of Agent; Exculpatory Provisions  . (a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.

(i)        shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  (ii)        shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents)  ;   provided   that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law; and 
  (iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
  (b)        The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in   Sections 9.01   and   7.01  ), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.

  SECTION 8.04.        Reliance by Agent  . The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the Closing Date or the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the occurrence of the Closing Date or the making of such Loan. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 8.05.        Delegation of Duties  .

The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as Agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
  SECTION 8.06.        Resignation of Agent  . (a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Resignation Effective Date   ), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  (b)        With effect from the Resignation Effective Date (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders hereunder, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.

Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.11  ,   9.04(f)   and   2.14   (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under   Section 2.14(f)   (it being understood and agreed that the documentation required under   Section 2.14(f)   shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   paragraph (b)   of this   Section 9.07  ;   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of   Section 2.18   as if it were an assignee under   paragraph (b)   of this   Section 9.07  ; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Sections 2.11   or   2.14  , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of   Section 2.18   with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 9.05   as though it were a Lender  ;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.15   as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register   )  ;   provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the  
  
   122 
  [[3596554]] 

contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)        Certain Pledges.

  SECTION 9.11.        Judgment  .   (a)   If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at Citibank s principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. 
  (b)        The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the    Primary Currency   ) to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess. 
  SECTION 9.12.        Jurisdiction, Etc  . (a)   Jurisdiction.   Each of Holdings and the Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Agent, any Lender or any Related Party of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
  (b)        Waiver of Venue.   Each of Holdings and the Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in   paragraph (a)   of this   Section 9.12  . Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

  SECTION 9.13.        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 9.14.        Patriot Act Notice  . Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Holdings and the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each of Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, which information includes the name and address of each of Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify Holdings and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower shall provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lenders in order to assist the Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act. 
  SECTION 9.15.        Other Relationships; No Fiduciary Duty  . No relationship created hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall in any way affect the ability of the Agent and each Lender to enter into or maintain business relationships with Holdings, the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof beyond the relationships specifically contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of Holdings and the Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, Holdings, the Borrower, their respective subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any advisory, equitable or fiduciary duties on the part of the Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, and no such duties will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. Each of Holdings and the Borrower also hereby agrees that none of the Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates have advised and are advising Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates as to any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax matters, and that each of Holdings and the Borrower is consulting its own advisors concerning such matters to the extent it deems appropriate. 
  SECTION 9.16.        WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  . EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS   SECTION 9.16  . 
  SECTION 9.17.        Interest Rate Limitation  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the    Maximum Rate   ). If the Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be  
  
   125 
  [[3596554]] 

applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Loan Document Obligations hereunder.

  (ii)        a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will  
  
   126 
  [[3596554]] 

be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

  (h)        The Parties agree that the dispute resolution procedures specified in this   Section 5.13   shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of Disputes, including all documents made a part thereof;   provided  ,   however  , that any Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration before any court of competent jurisdiction if such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage.  Despite such action, the Parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this   Section 5.13  . 
  (i)        Any decision or award of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be reasoned and in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration proceeding.  The Parties  
  
   21 

agree not to invoke or exercise any rights to appeal, review, vacate or impugn such decision or award by the Arbitral Tribunal, except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act (including Chapters 2 and 3 thereof) or the New York Convention, as applicable.  The Parties also agree that judgment upon the arbitral decision or award may be entered and enforced in any court where the Parties to the arbitration proceeding or their assets may be found (to whose jurisdiction the Parties consent for the purpose of entering and enforcing judgment on the arbitral decision and award) as well as any other court having jurisdiction thereof. 
  (j)        If any prevailing party is required to retain counsel to enforce the arbitral decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Party against whom the decision or award is made shall reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred and paid to said counsel for such service.   
  (k)        The Parties agree and understand that, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any national or international stock exchange regulations applicable to a Party, or is required to protect or pursue a legal right, every aspect concerning the process of arbitration shall be treated with the utmost confidentiality and that the arbitration procedure itself shall be confidential. 
  (l)        The Parties agree that notifications of any proceedings, reports, communications, orders, arbitral decisions, arbitral awards, arbitral award enforcement petitions, and any other document shall be sent as set forth in   Section 5.01  . 
  (m)        The Parties consent that any pending or contemplated arbitration hereunder may be consolidated with any prior arbitration arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the Merger Agreement or the Tax Matters Agreement) for the purposes of efficiency and to avoid the possibility of inconsistent awards.  An application for such consolidation may be made by any Party to this Agreement or such other Transaction Documents to the tribunal for the prior arbitration.  The tribunal to the prior arbitration shall, after providing all interested parties the opportunity to comment on such application, order that any such pending or contemplated arbitration be consolidated into a prior arbitration if it determines that (i) the issues in the arbitrations involve common questions of law or fact, (ii) no Party to either arbitration shall be prejudiced, whether by delay or otherwise, by the consolidation, (iii) any Party to the pending or contemplated arbitration which did not join an application for consolidation, or does not consent to such an application, is sufficiently related to the Parties in the prior arbitration that their interests were sufficiently represented in the appointment of the tribunal for the prior arbitral tribunal, and (iv) consolidation would be more efficient that separate arbitral proceedings. 
  Section 5.14        Consent to Jurisdiction  .  Any Proceeding seeking to obtain a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment or other order in aid of arbitration in connection with this Agreement shall and may be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, where such court does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware (   Delaware Courts   ), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to venue laid  
  
   22 

therein, any objection on the grounds of forum non conveniens, or any objection based on or on account of its place of incorporation or domicile, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such Proceeding in any Delaware Court (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto).  Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees that service or process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware, in any manner permitted by applicable law or, without limiting the foregoing, in the manner provided for notices in   Section 5.01  .

The Parties hereby mutually covenant and agree that, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions of the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) and Applicable Law: 
  (a)        Existing Spinco Orders  .  With respect to any Orders under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement that are being performed, in whole or in part, by the Spinco Business (the    Existing Spinco Orders   ), whether pursuant to a purchase order, subcontract, Intra-Lockheed Martin Work Transfer Agreement or other inter-division or Intra-Lockheed Martin agreement or arrangement, program directive, intra-division work order or otherwise (collectively, the    Existing Spinco POs   ), then, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Spinco Business shall supply to the Parent Companies, and the Parent Companies shall purchase from the Spinco Business, the work that would have been provided under such Existing Spinco POs pursuant to the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) and the Existing Spinco Orders, as applicable.

  (b)        Existing Bids by the Spinco Business  .  Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Spinco Business has submitted quotations, bids or proposals for work under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) (   Spinco Bids   ).  In the event that Parent or Spinco or a Subsidiary of Parent or Spinco is awarded an Order under a Shared Contract (Parent Companies) as a result of a Spinco Bid (either before or after the effective date of this Agreement) (each, a    Spinco Bid Order   ), and to the extent no Existing Spinco PO in respect of such Spinco Bid Order exists on the effective date of this Agreement, then Parent and Spinco shall enter into a purchase order, subcontract, work order or similar agreement (each, a    Spinco Bid PO   ) consistent with the price or cost estimate supplied by the Spinco Business for such Spinco Bid prior to the effective date of this Agreement and the Spinco Bid Order related thereto, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the same terms, conditions and provisions and at the same prices set forth herein applicable to Existing Spinco POs that would have applied if an Existing Spinco PO with respect to the work that results from the Spinco Bid had been entered into by the Parent Business and the Spinco Business prior to the date of this Agreement.  The Spinco Bids covered by this Agreement include those listed on   Exhibit C   hereto.  Upon request by Spinco, Parent shall, and shall cause all Parent Companies to, file,  
  
   3 

prosecute and intervene in all bid protest actions on behalf of Spinco, subject to Parent s exercise of reasonable discretion (after consulting with outside counsel) that it has satisfied its obligations under Applicable Law prior to the filing, prosecution or intervention in such bid protests.   
  (c)        Future Bids  .  With respect to the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies), from and after the date of this Agreement and during the term of such Shared Contracts (Parent Companies), Parent shall provide Spinco, in writing, the following:  (i) any draft task order request for proposal (   TO RFP   ), (ii) any customer-announced intent to release a draft TO RFP, (iii) any draft TO RFP release dates and (iv) any final TO RFP under such Shared Contracts (Parent Companies).

With respect to each Shared Contract (Parent Companies), the following terms and conditions shall apply:  
  (i)        Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to submit, or to cause its Subsidiaries to submit, on Parent s behalf or on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries, any quotations, bids or proposals under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) (a    Parent Bid   ), other than quotations, bids or proposals for prospective Orders within the reserved business areas described on   Exhibit D   (such reserved business areas, the    Reserved Business Area   ). 
    
  (ii)        Parent shall have the first right, in its sole discretion, to submit, or to cause its Subsidiaries to submit, on Parent s behalf or on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries, any Parent Bid under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) in the Reserved Business Area.  Parent shall provide notice to Spinco of whether Parent intends to submit a Parent Bid for a prospective Order in the Reserved Business Area no later than the earlier of (A) seven (7) days after release of the applicable TO RFP, or (B) if such TO RFP requires notification of intent to bid by a specified date, two (2) Business Days prior to such date.  
    
  (iii)        If Parent shall decide in its sole discretion not to submit a Parent Bid for a prospective Order under Section 2(c)(ii) above then,  subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Spinco shall have the right to request, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the applicable TO RFP from Parent (or, if later, within three (3) Business Days after Parent s delivery of the notice contemplated in Section 2(c)(ii)), that Parent submit, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to submit, on behalf of the Spinco Business, any quotations, bids or proposals for work under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) within the Reserved Business Area, on the terms and conditions proposed by the Spinco Business, and Parent agrees to, or to cause its applicable Subsidiary to, submit such quotations, bids or proposals in connection with any procurement within the Reserved Business Area, except to the extent Parent determines, after consultation with counsel, (A) that the terms and conditions proposed by Spinco reasonably could be interpreted to violate Applicable Law, the applicable Shared Contract (Parent Companies), the terms of this Agreement, or the terms of any other agreement to which a Parent Company is bound as of the date hereof, or (B) the scope of the work proposed in the quotation, bid or proposal would create an organizational conflict of interest for RMT Parent or  
  
   4 

Spinco.  Spinco shall submit any such quotations, bids or proposals along with all necessary accompanying information to Parent or its applicable Subsidiary at least five (5) Business Days (or such other period as shall be consistent with the applicable proposal cycle time) prior to the date that the proposal is due to be submitted.  Upon request by Spinco, Parent shall, and shall cause all Parent Companies to, file, prosecute or intervene in all bid protest actions on behalf of Spinco, subject to Parent s exercise of reasonable discretion (after consulting with outside counsel) that it has satisfied its obligations under Applicable Law prior to the filing, prosecution or intervention in such bid protests.   
    
  (iv)        For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Companies shall not be required to submit on behalf of the Spinco Business any quotations, bids, or proposals under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) either (A) outside of the Reserved Business Area, or (B) if Parent or the applicable Parent subsidiary intends to submit a quotation, bid or proposal for that prospective Order on its own account.

  (d)        Spinco POs  .  In the event the quotation, bid or proposal of the Spinco Business is successful and an Order is awarded (a    New Spinco Order    and, collectively with the Existing Spinco Orders and the Spinco Bid Orders, the    Spinco Orders   ), Parent and Spinco (or their applicable Subsidiaries) shall enter into a purchase order, subcontract, work order or similar agreement, consistent with the price or cost estimate and other terms and conditions of the proposal previously supplied by the Spinco Business and on such other terms and conditions as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parties (a    New Spinco PO    and, collectively with the Existing Spinco POs and the Spinco Bid POs, the    Spinco POs   ), pursuant to which Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary shall perform the work under the New Spinco Order that was awarded in response to such proposal.  
    
  (i)        Spinco POs shall include provisions for cost recovery in favor of Parent or its applicable Subsidiary in the nature of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs that appropriately and reasonably (consistent with past practice) take into account Applicable Law and the work to be performed by Parent or its applicable Subsidiary pursuant to and during the term of such Spinco POs, but no provision for Parent fee or profit.  Further, Spinco POs shall be administered as addressed in   Exhibit E   (the    Cost Principles   ).   
    
  (ii)        In the event that Spinco or any other Spinco Company breaches the covenants set forth in this Agreement or the requirements, provisions or terms of a Spinco Order, which results in Damages suffered by Parent, then Spinco or such Spinco Company shall be liable for all Damages to the extent arising from such breach, and Spinco or such Spinco  
  
   5 

Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent (or its applicable Subsidiary) from and against any Damages arising from any third-party claim asserted against or sought to be collected from Parent (or its applicable Subsidiary) resulting from Spinco s or such Spinco Company s breach;   provided   that the aggregate liability of Spinco and the Spinco Companies with respect to any Spinco Order, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or restitution, or for breach of statutory duty or misrepresentation, or otherwise, shall be limited to the value of such Spinco Order. 
  (iii)        Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, contacts with the customer with respect to the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) shall be the responsibility of Parent (or its applicable Subsidiary).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause the other Parent Companies to, (A) take such timely action as is reasonably necessary to allow the Spinco Companies to perform each Spinco PO and to protect any rights that may exist or accrue to Spinco Companies under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) and any Orders issued thereunder, including permitting Spinco Companies to communicate directly with customers under Spinco POs to the maximum extent permitted by the customer, (B) enforce, at Spinco s cost and at the reasonable request of and for the benefit of the Spinco Companies, any and all claims, rights and benefits of Spinco Companies against the U.S. Government or any third party arising from or relating to any such Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) or any Orders issued thereunder, and (C) transfer applicable payments to the Spinco Companies in full, within fifteen (15) business days of the invoice date.

Parent shall provide Spinco with prompt written notice of any termination, amendment or modification of any Shared Contract (Parent Companies) or any related Orders under which work is being performed by the Spinco Business that affects Spinco s rights and obligations hereunder in any material respect.

  (g)        Efforts to Transfer Spinco POs  .  At Spinco s request, Parent shall, and cause all Parent Companies to, use reasonable best efforts in cooperation with Spinco and Spinco Companies to transfer or obtain re-awards of the Spinco POs to or under other suitable contract vehicles held by Spinco or Spinco Companies, and to obtain all novation or other consents and approvals of Government Authorities for such transfers or re-awards. 
  (h)        Limited License  .  To the extent required for Spinco or the applicable Spinco Companies to perform the Spinco POs in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent hereby grants and licenses to Spinco and its applicable Affiliates the right to possess, access, and use any Intellectual Property that was developed by the Spinco Business prior to the Distribution Date in connection with the Spinco Business s performance of work pursuant to any Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) prior to the Distribution Date, solely to the extent required to perform the Spinco POs in accordance with this Agreement. 
  Section 3.        Failure to Obtain Consent to Subcontract  .  The Parties acknowledge that certain Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) require Parent (or its applicable Subsidiaries) to obtain the consent of a Governmental Authority to subcontract a portion of the work.  If such Governmental Authority decides not to grant its consent to a subcontract entered into pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall promptly present to the Governmental Authority any grounds for reversal of such decision provided by Spinco, and Spinco shall provide all necessary assistance  
  
   7 

in connection with such presentation.  If the Governmental Authority refuses to reverse its decision, the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss alternative means to allow the Parties to fulfill their respective obligations under such Shared Contract (Parent Companies).

  Section 5.        Use of Intellectual Property  .  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement amends or modifies the provisions of the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement.  To the extent any Intellectual Property is developed by Spinco or its Subsidiaries in connection with Spinco s performance of work pursuant to any Shared Contracts (Parent Companies), the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to allocate ownership and use of such Intellectual Property based upon the intended use and application of such Intellectual Property in the Spinco Business and/or the Parent Business, as the case may be, based upon the following key principles: (i) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Spinco Business shall be retained by the Spinco Companies with no grant of rights to the Parent Companies, (ii) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Parent Business shall be transferred to the Parent Companies with no grant of rights to the Spinco Companies, and (iii) Intellectual Property with application to both the Spinco Business and the Parent Business shall be retained by the Spinco Companies and licensed to Parent on a nonexclusive basis, in each case based on terms and conditions consistent with the similar provisions of the Separation Agreement and the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement with respect to Transferred Intellectual Property, Excluded Intellectual Property, Licensed Intellectual Property and Licensed-Back Intellectual Property, as the case may be. To the extent that, under the terms of any Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) or Orders, rights in Intellectual Property are required to be granted to or otherwise made available to the U.S. Government, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to provide such rights under the terms and conditions of customary license or other agreements. 
  Section 6.        Proprietary Information  .   
  (a)        Definitions  .  The term    Proprietary Information    means all proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information that relates to and is disclosed by one Party or its Affiliates (the    Originating Party   ) to the other Party or its Affiliates (the    Receiving Party   ) under or in connection with this Agreement;   provided   that Proprietary Information shall not include Transferred Intellectual Property, Licensed Intellectual Property, Licensed-Back  
  
   8 

Intellectual Property or Spinco Business Proprietary Information, it being understood that such confidential information and data shall be protected and preserved by the Parties in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.  Without limiting the foregoing, the term  Proprietary Information  shall include all pricing data and information disclosed by any Party, including any such data or information disclosed in connection with a Shared Contract (Parent Companies) under this Agreement. 
  (b)        Disclosure and Use  .  The Receiving Party (i) shall (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates to) treat and hold as confidential all Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party, and (ii) shall not (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to) disclose to any Person, publish or make publicly available any Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party.  The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party solely during the term of this Agreement and solely in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any pricing data or information of an Originating Party in any Bid or proposal, other than in connection with proposals submitted under a Shared Contract (Parent Companies) in accordance with this Agreement. 
  (c)        Exceptions  .  This Agreement shall not restrict disclosure or use of Proprietary Information that: 
  (i)        appears in issued patents, published patent applications or other publications that are generally available to the public;  
  (ii)        is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives or Affiliates; 
  (iii)        is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source that, to such Receiving Party s knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation; or

  (d)        The arbitral tribunal (   Arbitral Tribunal   ) shall consist of three arbitrators.  The claimant(s) and respondent(s), respectively, shall each appoint one arbitrator within 30 days of the date of delivery of the demand of arbitration, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two Party-appointed arbitrators within 30 days of the date of appointment of the second arbitrator.  Any arbitrator not timely appointed as provided herein shall be appointed by the AAA.  For the avoidance of doubt, each of the claimant and the respondent in the arbitration shall be permitted to consult with its respective appointed arbitrator in connection with such arbitrators  selection of the third arbitrator.

  (f)        The parties shall share equally the arbitration administrative fees, the panel member fees and costs, and any other costs associated with the arbitration.  Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys  fees. The Arbitral Tribunal shall have no authority to award damages in excess of any limitations set forth in this Agreement.

  (h)        The Parties agree that the dispute resolution procedures specified in this     Section 18   shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of Disputes, including all documents made a part thereof;   provided  ,   however  , that any Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration before any court of competent jurisdiction if such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage.  Despite such action, the Parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this   Section 18  . 
  
   14 

(i)        Any decision or award of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be reasoned and in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration proceeding.  The Parties agree not to invoke or exercise any rights to appeal, review, vacate or impugn such decision or award by the Arbitral Tribunal, except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act (including Chapters 2 and 3 thereof) or the New York Convention, as applicable.  The Parties also agree that judgment upon the arbitral decision or award may be entered and enforced against the parties to the arbitration proceeding or their assets wherever they may be found (to whose jurisdiction the parties consent for the purpose of entering and enforcing judgment on the arbitral decision and award) as well as any other court having jurisdiction thereof. 
  (j)        If any prevailing party is required to retain counsel to enforce the arbitral decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Party against whom the decision or award is made shall reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred and paid to said counsel for such service.

  (l)        The Parties agree that notifications of any proceedings, reports, communications, orders, arbitral decisions, arbitral awards, arbitral award enforcement petitions, and any other document shall be sent as set forth in   Section 7  .  
  (m)        The parties consent that any pending or contemplated arbitration hereunder may be consolidated with any prior arbitration arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the Merger Agreement or the Tax Matters Agreement) for the purposes of efficiency and to avoid the possibility of inconsistent awards.  An application for such consolidation may be made by any party to this Agreement or such other Transaction Documents to the tribunal for the prior arbitration.  The tribunal to the prior arbitration shall, after providing all interested parties the opportunity to comment on such application, order that any such pending or contemplated arbitration be consolidated into a prior arbitration if it determines that (i) the issues in the arbitrations involve common questions of law or fact, (ii) no party to either arbitration shall be prejudiced, whether by delay or otherwise, by the consolidation, (iii) any party to the pending or contemplated arbitration which did not join an application for consolidation, or does not consent to such an application, is sufficiently related to the parties in the prior arbitration that their interests were sufficiently represented in the appointment of the tribunal for the prior arbitral tribunal, and (iv) consolidation would be more efficient that separate arbitral proceedings.

Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees that service or process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware, in any manner permitted by applicable law or, without limiting the foregoing, in the manner provided for notices in     Section 7  .

  RESERVED BUSINESS AREA 
    
           (I) 
    Reserved Business Area  :  The    Reserved Business Area    for purposes of this Agreement means all prospective Orders that are   not   within the  Parent Scope  referenced below.   
              (A) 
    Parent Scope  : 
       
           (1) 
    Prospective Orders where, as of the Distribution Effective Time, Parent (including the portions of the former IS GS business area that are not part of the Spinco Business, but excluding the Spinco Business) (   LM Remainco   ) is an incumbent. 
       
           (2) 
    Prospective Orders where the predominant work under the Order is of the type that, as of the Distribution Effective Time, is more within the  core competencies  of LM Remainco than the  core competencies  of the Spinco Business. 
       
  For purposes of determining the foregoing, the  core competencies  of LM Remainco and the Spinco Business will be based on which Party has the most relevant past performance, including the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data (including whether LM Remainco is or was the OEM), and general trends in the contractor s performance, in a good faith effort to classify the scope as being primarily within the scope of one party or the other party. Reference is made to FAR 15.305, Proposal Evaluation, for factors relevant to this determination. 
    
  Parent may not submit a quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order if the submission of such quotation, bid or proposal to the U.S. Government would violate Applicable Law, breach any Contract of Spinco as of the Distribution Effective Time or would create an Organizational Conflict of Interest ( OCI ) issue for RMT Parent or Spinco, it being understood and agreed that the Parties will consider good faith modifications to the quotation, bid or proposal or the role of the Parties in submitting the quotation, bid or proposal for the purposes of avoiding any such violation of Applicable Law, breach or OCI issue. 
    
  No prospective Order shall be within the Parent Scope to the extent that 
  (a)        the Spinco Business is the incumbent, or 
  (b)        the prospective Order or competition that is the subject of the prospective Order was in the Spinco Business s long range plan as of December 3, 2015. 

(B) 
    Spinco Scope: 
       
  All prospective Orders that are not within the Parent Scope referenced above. 
    
  * * * *  
           (II) 
    Future Actions 
       
  Upon the expiration of each Shared Contract (Parent Companies), either Party may bid on any replacement vehicle or recompete procurement. 
    
           (III) 
    Dispute Resolution Process  :  
       
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in   Section 18   of the Agreement, disputes between the Parties regarding whether a particular prospective Order falls within or outside of the Reserved Business Area shall be resolved as follows: 
           (a) 
    All disputes shall be escalated promptly to senior management of Parent and Spinco.   
     Senior management shall have 48 hours to resolve any dispute from the time such conflict is identified to both Parties.  In the case of Parent, senior management shall mean: 
  Stephen (Steve) F. O Bryane          stephen.f.obryan@lmco.com          202-863-3447 (office)          817-296-6333 (cell) 
  and 
  Kay Sears    kay.sears@lmco.com    303-977-2203 (office)  202-968-4412 (cell)

  or, in each case, such other individual(s) as a Party may designate in advance to the other.  
           (b) 
    If no agreement is reached in accordance with paragraph (a), then the dispute shall be referred to an outside expert (an    Expert   ) agreed upon by the Parties, which Expert shall be promptly engaged by the Parties.  Such Expert (i) must have expertise in government contracting, IDIQ vehicles and GSA schedules, (ii) must not have a conflict of interest (unless such conflict is waived in the sole discretion of the relevant Party and any relevant third parties) and (iii) may or may not be an attorney.   
     The Parties must provide a copy of the prospective Order request, request for quote or similar document provided by the procuring agency, along with all position papers and other relevant documentation to such Expert(s) immediately upon engagement, and shall cooperate to facilitate the Expert(s) s review of the dispute.  The Expert(s) shall have five Business Days from the time of engagement to resolve the dispute, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties;   provided  , that if the applicable quotation, bid or proposal  is due within a period of less than 30 days from the time of engagement, then the Expert shall have no more than three Business Days from the time of engagement to resolve the dispute. 
  If Parent is not an incumbent and the Expert(s) cannot make a determination that the task order is more within the  core competencies  of Parent than the  core competencies  of the Spinco Business (effectively, a tie), then Parent shall have the sole right to submit or cause its Subsidiaries to submit a Parent Bid on the opportunity. 
           (c) 
    Any dispute resolved in accordance with this dispute resolution process shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

EXHIBIT E 
    
  COST PRINCIPLES 
    
           1. 
    With respect to each Shared Contract (Parent Companies), Parent will, or will cause the applicable Parent Subsidiary to, take reasonable best efforts to maintain each Spinco PO within a cost segment that is generally compatible with the work being performed and the competitive environment of such Spinco PO, broadly consistent with Parent s general business practices. 
       
           2. 
    With respect to any Existing Spinco PO, any Spinco Bid PO, or any New Spinco PO resulting from any quotation, bid or proposal for any Order made by the Spinco Business under the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies) (a    Spinco Future Bid   ) that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission)within ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time (together,    Covered Spinco POs   ), in each case, in the event and to the extent it becomes impracticable due to customer reaction or otherwise in Parent s reasonable good faith determination to maintain both (a) the pricing applicable to such Covered Spinco PO, and (b) recovery by Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in such Covered Spinco PO in accordance with Section 2(d)(i), then (b) shall be reduced accordingly. 
       
           3. 
    With respect to any Spinco PO resulting from a Spinco Future Bid that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission)more than ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time, in the event and to the extent it becomes impracticable due to customer reaction  or otherwise in Parent s reasonable good faith determination to maintain both (a) the pricing applicable to such Spinco PO, and (b) recovery by Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in such Spinco PO in accordance with Section 2(d)(i), then (b) shall be reduced accordingly and any resulting reduction in (b) shall be deemed to be Damages to Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary, and Spinco shall promptly indemnify and hold harmless Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary from and against any such Damages. 
       
           4. 
    With respect to any Covered Spinco PO, in the event and to the extent Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary incurs any penalty or price, cost recovery, or fee reduction due to a customer finding of excessive subcontracting pass-through resulting from consummation of the undertakings contemplated by the Transaction Documents, then Spinco shall have no liability to Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary. 

5. 
    With respect to any Spinco PO resulting from a Spinco Future Bid that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission) more than ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time, in the event and to the extent Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary incurs any penalty or price, cost recovery, or fee reduction due to a customer finding of excessive subcontracting pass-through resulting from consummation of the undertakings contemplated by the Transaction Documents, then any such penalty or reduction  shall be deemed to be Damages to Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary, and Spinco shall promptly indemnify and hold harmless Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary from and against any such Damages.  
       
           6. 
    Parent shall (and Spinco will cooperate with Parent to) use reasonable efforts to convince the applicable customers that provisions for recovery by Parent or the applicable Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in Spinco POs in accordance with Section 2(d)(i) are related to the performance of subcontract management functions that constitute  Added Value  (as such term is defined in Section 52.215-23 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (October 2009)). 
       
           7. 
    For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the hold harmless and indemnification provisions in Cost Principles Paragraphs 3 and 5 above, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Spinco from submitting any Spinco Future Bids for 100% of the scope of a prospective Order by reason of a limitation on excessive subcontracting pass-through charges or any actual or anticipated impracticality of maintaining both the (a) pricing applicable to such Order or the associated Spinco PO and (b) recovery by Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs   in accordance with Section 2(d)(i).

  Section 2.      Treatment of Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies)  . The Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) shall be transferred and novated to the Spinco Companies as Transferred Assets, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The Parties hereby mutually covenant and agree that, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions of the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) and Applicable Law: 
  (a)  Existing Parent Orders  . With respect to any Orders under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement that are being performed, in whole or in part, by the Parent Business (the    Existing Parent Orders   ), whether pursuant to a purchase order, subcontract, Intra-Lockheed Martin Work Transfer Agreement or other inter-division or Intra-Lockheed Martin agreement or arrangement, program directive, intra-division work order or otherwise (collectively, the    Existing Parent POs   ), then, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Business shall supply to the Spinco Companies, and the Spinco Companies shall purchase from the Parent Business, the work that would have been provided under such Existing Parent POs pursuant to the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) and the Existing Parent Orders, as applicable. The Existing Parent POs covered by this Agreement are listed on   Exhibit B   hereto. 
  (b)  Existing Bids by the Parent Business  . Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Parent Business has submitted quotations, bids or proposals for work under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) (   Parent Bids   ). In the event that Spinco or Parent or a Subsidiary of Spinco  
  
   3 

or Parent is awarded an Order under a Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) as a result of a Parent Bid (either before or after the effective date of this Agreement) (each, a    Parent Bid Order   ), and to the extent no Existing Parent PO in respect of such Parent Bid Order exists on the effective date of this Agreement, then Spinco and Parent shall enter into a purchase order, subcontract, work order or similar agreement (each, a    Parent Bid PO   ) consistent with the price or cost estimate supplied by the Parent Business for such Parent Bid prior to the effective date of this Agreement and the Parent Bid Order related thereto, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the same terms, conditions and provisions and at the same prices set forth herein applicable to Existing Parent POs that would have applied if an Existing Parent PO with respect to the work that results from the Parent Bid had been entered into by the Spinco Business and the Parent Business prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parent Bids covered by this Agreement include those listed on   Exhibit C   hereto. Upon request by Parent, Spinco shall, and shall cause all Spinco Companies, to file, prosecute and intervene in all bid protest actions on behalf of Parent, subject to Spinco s exercise of reasonable discretion (after consulting with outside counsel) that it has satisfied its obligations under Applicable Law prior to the filing, prosecution or intervention in such bid protests. 
  (c)  Future Bids  . With respect to the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies), from and after the date of this Agreement and during the term of such Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies), Spinco shall provide Parent, in writing, the following:  (i) any draft task order request for proposal (   TO RFP   ), (ii) any customer-announced intent to release a draft TO RFP, (iii) any draft TO RFP release dates and (iv) any final TO RFP under such Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies).  Each of the foregoing shall be provided to Parent simultaneously with Spinco s internal distribution of the same, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after release (or with respect to release dates, Spinco becoming aware thereof), as applicable, and in each case without regard to whether such opportunities fall within or outside of the Reserved Business Area (as defined below). With respect to each Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), the following terms and conditions shall apply: 
  (i)  Spinco shall have the right in its sole discretion to submit, or to cause its Subsidiaries to submit, on Spinco s behalf or on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries, any quotations, bids or proposals under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) (a    Spinco Bid   ), other than quotations, bids or proposals for prospective Orders within the reserved business areas described on   Exhibit D   (such reserved business areas, the    Reserved Business Area   ). 
  (ii)  Spinco shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, submit on Spinco s behalf or on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries any Spinco Bid under a Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) in the Reserved Business Area. 
  (iii)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall have the right to request, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the applicable TO RFP  
  
   4 

from Spinco, that Spinco submit, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to submit, on behalf of the Parent Business, any quotations, bids or proposals for work under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) within the Reserved Business Area, on the terms and conditions proposed by the Parent Business, and Spinco agrees to, or to cause its applicable Subsidiary to, submit such quotations, bids or proposals in connection with any procurement within the Reserved Business Area, except to the extent Spinco determines, after consultation with counsel, (A) that the terms and conditions proposed by Parent reasonably could be interpreted to violate Applicable Law, the applicable Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), the terms of this Agreement, or the terms of any other agreement to which a Spinco Company is bound as of the date hereof, or (B) the scope of the work proposed in the quotation, bid or proposal would create an organizational conflict of interest for Spinco or RMT Parent. Parent shall submit any such quotations, bids or proposals along with all necessary accompanying information to Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary at least five (5) Business Days (or such other period as shall be consistent with the applicable proposal cycle time) prior to the date that the proposal is due to be submitted. Upon request by Parent, Spinco shall, and shall cause all Spinco Companies to, file, prosecute or intervene in all bid protest actions on behalf of Parent, subject to Spinco s exercise of reasonable discretion (after consulting with outside counsel) that it has satisfied its obligations under Applicable Law prior to the filing, prosecution or intervention in such bid protests. 
  (iv)  For the avoidance of doubt, the Spinco Companies shall not be required to submit on behalf of the Parent Business any quotations, bids, or proposals under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) outside of the Reserved Business Area. 
  (v)  No later than forty-five (45) days after the Distribution Date, the Parties shall (A) hold a pipeline review meeting and establish a regular cadence for meetings to conduct the pipeline review, (B) identify their respective points of contact with respect to the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) and (C) discuss, and if mutually agreeable, prepare a concept of operations (CONOPS) protocol addressing the procedures to be utilized by the Parties with respect to future bids  . 
  (d)  Parent POs  . In the event the quotation, bid or proposal of the Parent Business is successful and an Order is awarded (a    New Parent Order    and, collectively with the Existing Parent Orders and the Parent Bid Orders, the    Parent Orders   ), Spinco and Parent (or their applicable Subsidiaries) shall enter into a purchase order, subcontract, work order or similar agreement, consistent with the price or cost estimate and other terms and conditions of the proposal previously supplied by the Parent Business and on such other terms and conditions as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parties (a    New Parent PO    and, collectively with the Existing Parent POs and the Parent Bid POs, the    Parent POs   ), pursuant to which Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall perform the work under the New Parent Order that was awarded in response to such proposal. 
  (i)  Parent POs shall include provisions for cost recovery in favor of Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary in the nature of arms-length subcontract management, material  
  
   5 

handling and/or other actual costs that appropriately and reasonably (consistent with past practice) take into account Applicable Law and the work to be performed by Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary pursuant to and during the term of such Parent POs, but no provision for Spinco fee or profit.  Further, Parent POs shall be administered as addressed in   Exhibit E   (the    Cost Principles   ). 
  (ii)  In the event that Parent or any other Parent Company breaches the covenants set forth in this Agreement or the requirements, provisions or terms of a Parent Order, which results in Damages suffered by Spinco, then Parent or such Parent Company shall be liable for all Damages to the extent arising from such breach, and Parent or such Parent Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Spinco (or its applicable Subsidiary) from and against any Damages arising from any third-party claim asserted against or sought to be collected from Spinco (or its applicable Subsidiary) resulting from Parent s or such Parent Company s breach;   provided   that the aggregate liability of Parent and the Parent Companies with respect to any Parent Order, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or restitution, or for breach of statutory duty or misrepresentation, or otherwise, shall be limited to the value of such Parent Order. 
  (iii)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, contacts with the customer with respect to the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) shall be the responsibility of Spinco (or its applicable Subsidiary). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spinco shall, and shall cause the other Spinco Companies to, (A) take such timely action as is reasonably necessary to allow the Parent Companies to perform each Parent PO and to protect any rights that may exist or accrue to Parent Companies under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) and any Orders issued thereunder, including permitting Parent Companies to communicate directly with customers under Parent POs to the maximum extent permitted by the customer, (B) enforce, at Parent s cost and at the reasonable request of and for the benefit of the Parents Companies, any and all claims, rights and benefits of Parent Companies against the U.S. Government or any third party arising from or relating to any such Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) or any Orders issued thereunder, and (C) transfer applicable payments to the Parent Companies in full, within fifteen (15) business days of the invoice date, except as otherwise agreed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cash management services contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement Spinco to Parent to be entered into concurrently herewith by Parent and Spinco. 
  (e)  Terms and Conditions  . Parent shall cause the applicable Parent Companies to perform each Parent PO in accordance with the respective specifications or scope of work set forth, or to be set forth, as the case may be, in the applicable Parent Order under the Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) with respect thereto and in accordance with the terms and conditions and at the same prices applicable to such Parent PO. The terms and conditions applicable to each Parent PO are as set forth in items (i) through (v) below. Such terms and conditions are listed in the order they are to be given precedence in the event of a conflict: 
  (i)  the terms and conditions expressly set forth in this Agreement; 
  
   6 

(ii)  the terms and conditions of the Parent PO, not including clauses (other than warranty clauses, mandatory FAR and DFARS flow-down clauses, and other provisions required for compliance purposes) that are incorporated therein and shall continue in effect from the Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) or any prime contract or higher tier subcontract that have been incorporated therein; 
  (iii)  the terms and conditions of any higher tier Parent Order corresponding to Parent PO, as the case may be, not including clauses (other than warranty clauses, mandatory FAR and DFARS flow-down clauses, and other provisions required for compliance purposes) that are incorporated therein and shall continue in effect from the Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) or any prime contract or higher tier subcontract that have been incorporated in such Parent Order; 
  (iv)  all clauses, modified as necessary to reflect the changed parties, now existing or incorporated after the date hereof in the applicable Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) or any prime contract or higher tier subcontract under which any Parent PO, or the Parent Order corresponding thereto, was or is issued that are required by such Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), prime contract or higher tier subcontract to be incorporated into Orders or other subcontracts issued thereunder, when the requirement is expressly set forth in such clause, or when Spinco Companies must impose the clause in order to comply with the terms of such Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), prime contract or higher tier subcontract, and any warranty terms in the Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), prime contracts or higher tier subcontracts; and 
  (v)  the terms and conditions of the standard terms and conditions attached hereto as   Exhibit F   (the    Standard Terms and Conditions   ), other than the reference to the state law governing the agreement identified in Section 2(a) included in such Standard Terms and Conditions, which shall be disregarded, it being understood that Parent shall be the  Performing Company  and Spinco shall be the  Requesting Company  under the Standard Terms and Conditions. 
  (f)  Notice of Termination, Amendment or Modification  . Spinco shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any termination, amendment or modification of any Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) or any related Orders under which work is being performed by the Parent Business that affects Parent s rights and obligations hereunder in any material respect. 
  Section 3.      Failure to Obtain Consent to Subcontract  . The Parties acknowledge that certain Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) require Spinco (or its applicable Subsidiaries) to obtain the consent of a Governmental Authority to subcontract a portion of the work. If such Governmental Authority decides not to grant its consent to a subcontract entered into pursuant to this Agreement, Spinco shall promptly present to the Governmental Authority any grounds for reversal of such decision provided by Parent, and Parent shall provide all necessary assistance in  
  
   7 

connection with such presentation. If the Governmental Authority refuses to reverse its decision, the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss alternative means to allow the Parties to fulfill their respective obligations under such Shared Contract (Spinco Companies). 
  Section 4.      Term  . This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written and shall continue in effect with respect to each Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) until the earlier to occur of (a) the expiration or termination, as the case may be, of such Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), and (b) the award to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of a substitute or successor contract vehicle to such Shared Contract (Spinco Companies);   provided  ,   however  , that the provisions of this   Section 4   (Term) and   Sections 5   (Use of Intellectual Property), 6 (Proprietary Information),   10   (Construction),   11   (Entire Agreement),   12   (Governing Law),   16   (Third Party Beneficiaries) and   18   (Dispute Resolution), as well as the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, the Cost Principles and the Standard Terms and Conditions that are applicable to Orders that by their terms survive the termination of the applicable Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), shall survive any such expiration. 
  Section 5.      Use of Intellectual Property.   Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement amends or modifies the provisions of the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement. To the extent any Intellectual Property is developed by Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with Parent s performance of work pursuant to any Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies), the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to allocate ownership and use of such Intellectual Property based upon the intended use and application of such Intellectual Property in the Parent Business and/or the Spinco Business, as the case may be, based upon the following key principles: (i) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Parent Business shall be retained by the Parent Companies with no grant of rights to the Spinco Companies, (ii) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Spinco Business shall be transferred to the Spinco Companies with no grant of rights to the Parent Companies, and (iii) Intellectual Property with application to both the Parent Business and the Spinco Business shall be retained by the Parent Companies and licensed to Spinco on a nonexclusive basis, in each case based on terms and conditions consistent with the similar provisions of the Separation Agreement and the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement with respect to Transferred Intellectual Property, Excluded Intellectual Property, Licensed Intellectual Property and Licensed-Back Intellectual Property, as the case may be. To the extent that, under the terms of any Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) or Orders, rights in Intellectual Property are required to be granted to or otherwise made available to the U.S. Government, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to provide such rights under the terms and conditions of customary license or other agreements. 
  
   8

  (a)      Definitions  .

  (b)  Disclosure and Use  . The Receiving Party (i) shall (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates to) treat and hold as confidential all Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party, and (ii) shall not (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to) disclose to any Person, publish or make publicly available any Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party. The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party solely during the term of this Agreement and solely in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not use or disclose any pricing data or information of an Originating Party in any Bid or proposal, other than in connection with proposals submitted under a Shared Contract (Spinco Companies) in accordance with this Agreement.

  (iv)  is or has been independently developed by the Receiving Party as evidenced by written documentation; 
  
   9 

provided   that information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such information is embraced by more general information in the public domain, unless the information itself is in the public domain. 
  (d)  Disclosures Required by Applicable Law  . In addition to the foregoing exceptions, in the event the Receiving Party is requested or required (by oral or written request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or by Applicable Law) to disclose any Proprietary Information, then the Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the Originating Party, at its expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this   Section 6.   If, in the absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, required to disclose such Proprietary Information, the Receiving Party may so disclose the information;   provided   that the Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such information. 
  (e)  No Other Rights Granted  . Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the Originating Party. Neither this Agreement nor disclosure of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any trade secrets, copyrights, inventions, patents or other Intellectual Property now or hereafter owned or controlled by either Party. 
  (f)  Non-Exclusive.   The rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in this   Section 6   are in addition and subject to any additional or supplemental agreements with respect to confidentiality or protection of proprietary information that may be agreed between the Parties.

Notes: (1) If the outstanding Spinco proposal for the multiple-award CECOM RS3 IDIQ contract vehicle results in a Contract award (any such Contract, the    Spinco RS3 Contract   ), it is acknowledged and agreed that the Spinco RS3 Contract will constitute a Transferred Asset under the terms of the Separation Agreement.  Without the need for formal amendment of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Spinco RS3 Contract shall be added to this Exhibit A as a Shared Contract (Spinco Companies);   provided  ,   however  , that notwithstanding Section 2(c) of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall have no right to request Spinco to submit any quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order under the Spinco RS3 Contract within the  Reserved Business Area,  but instead, Parent shall have the right to submit a quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order under the Spinco RS3 Contract (without regard to the Reserved Business Area) (a) only if Spinco has decided in its sole discretion not to submit a quotation, bid or proposal for such prospective Order on its own account, and (b) unless Spinco has determined, after consultation with counsel, that the submission of such quotation, bid or proposal reasonably could be interpreted to violate Applicable Law, breach any Contract of Spinco as of the Distribution Effective Time or create an OCI  

issue.  If requested by Parent, Spinco shall provide notice to Parent of whether Spinco intends to submit a quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order no later than the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days after release of the applicable TO RFP, or (ii) if such TO RFP requires notification of intent to bid by a specified date, two (2) Business Days prior to such date.  For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will Parent have any right to request Spinco to submit any quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order under any CECOM RS3 contract that may be awarded to RMT Parent, and such contract vehicle shall not be a Shared Contract (Spinco Companies). 
    
  (2) For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the CIO-SP3 IDIQ contract vehicle, the right of Parent to request Spinco to submit any quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order within Parent s Reserved Business Area shall apply solely to the shared CIO-SP3 Contract transferred by Parent to Spinco and listed above, and that right shall not be construed to limit or interfere in any way with Spinco s or RMT Parent s unilateral right to submit a quotation, bid or proposal under the CIO-SP3 IDIQ contract vehicle held by RMT Parent prior to the Distribution Effective Time.

  RESERVED BUSINESS AREA 
    
           (I) 
    The    Reserved Business Area    for purposes of this Agreement means all prospective Orders that are within the  Parent Scope  referenced below. 
       
           (A) 
    Parent Scope  : 
       
           (1) 
    Prospective Orders where, as of the Distribution Effective Time, Parent (including the portions of the former IS GS business area that are not part of the Spinco Business, but excluding the Spinco Business) (   LM Remainco   ) is an incumbent. 
       
           (2) 
    Prospective Orders where the predominant work under the Order is of the type that, as of the Distribution Effective Time, is more within the  core competencies  of LM Remainco than the  core competencies  of the Spinco Business. 
     For purposes of determining the foregoing, the  core competencies  of LM Remainco and the Spinco Business will be based on which Party has the most relevant past performance, including the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data (including whether LM Remainco is or was the OEM), and general trends in the contractor s performance, in a good faith effort to classify the scope as being primarily within the scope of one party or the other party. Reference is made to FAR 15.305, Proposal Evaluation, for factors relevant to this determination. 
  Parent may not submit a quotation, bid or proposal for a prospective Order if the submission of such quotation, bid or proposal to the U.S. Government would violate Applicable Law, breach any Contract of Spinco as of the Distribution Effective Time or would create an Organizational Conflict of Interest (   OCI   ) issue for RMT Parent or Spinco, it being understood and agreed that the Parties will consider good faith modifications to the quotation, bid or proposal or the role of the Parties in submitting the quotation, bid or proposal for the purposes of avoiding any such violation of Applicable Law, breach or OCI issue. 
  No prospective Order shall be within the Parent Scope to the extent that 
  (a)        the Spinco Business is the incumbent, or 

(b) 
    the prospective Order or competition that is the subject of the prospective Order was in the Spinco Business s long range plan as of December 3, 2015. 
              (B) 
    Spinco Scope: 
     All prospective Orders that are not within the Parent Scope referenced above. 
  * * * * 
           (II) 
    Future Actions 
       
  Upon the expiration of each Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), either Party may bid on any replacement vehicle or recompete procurement. 
    
           (III) 
    Dispute Resolution Process    
       
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 18 of the Agreement, disputes between the Parties regarding whether a particular prospective Order falls within or outside of the Reserved Business Area shall be resolved as follows: 
           (a) 
    All disputes shall be escalated promptly to senior management of Parent and Spinco.   
     Senior management shall have 48 hours to resolve any dispute from the time such conflict is identified to both Parties.  In the case of Parent, senior management shall mean: 
  Stephen (Steve) F. O Bryane          stephen.f.obryan@lmco.com          202-863-3447 (office)          817-296-6333 (cell) 
  and 
  Kay Sears      kay.sears@lmco.com  303-977-2203 (office)  202-968-4412 (cell) 
  and, in the case of Spinco, senior management shall mean: 
  Gerard (Gerry) A. Fasano          gerard.a.fasano@lmco.com 
  610-531-5420 (office) 
  610-513-4412 (cell)

  or, in each case, such other individual(s) as a Party may designate in advance to the other.  
           (b) 
    If no agreement is reached in accordance with paragraph (a), then the dispute shall be referred to an outside expert (an    Expert   ) agreed upon by the Parties, which Expert shall be promptly engaged by the Parties.  Such Expert (i) must have expertise in government contracting, IDIQ vehicles and GSA schedules, (ii) must not have a conflict of interest (unless such conflict is waived in the sole discretion of the relevant Party and any relevant third parties) and (iii) may or may not be an attorney.   
     The Parties must provide a copy of the prospective Order request, request for quote or similar document provided by the procuring agency, along with all position papers and other relevant documentation to such Expert(s) immediately upon engagement, and shall cooperate to facilitate the Expert(s) s review of the dispute.  The Expert(s) shall have five Business Days from the time of engagement to resolve the dispute, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties;   provided  , that if the applicable quotation, bid or proposal is due within a period of less than 30 days from the time of engagement, then the Expert shall have no more than three Business Days from the time of engagement to resolve the dispute. 
  If Parent is not an incumbent and the Expert(s) cannot make a determination that the task order is more within the  core competencies  of Parent than the  core competencies  of the Spinco Business (effectively, a tie), then Spinco shall have the sole right to submit or cause its Subsidiaries to submit a Spinco Bid on the opportunity.     
           (c) 
    Any dispute resolved in accordance with this dispute resolution process shall be final and binding upon the Parties. 

EXHIBIT E 
  COST PRINCIPLES 
    
           1. 
    With respect to each Shared Contract (Spinco Companies), Spinco will, or will cause the applicable Spinco Subsidiary to, take reasonable best efforts to maintain each Parent PO within a cost segment that is generally compatible with the work being performed and the competitive environment of such Parent PO, broadly consistent with Spinco s general business practices. 
       
           2. 
    With respect to any Existing Parent PO, any Parent Bid PO, or any New Parent PO resulting from any quotation, bid or proposal for any Order made by the Parent Business under the Shared Contracts (Spinco Companies) (a    Parent Future Bid   ) that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission) within ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time (together,    Covered Parent POs   ), in each case, in the event and to the extent it becomes impracticable due to customer reaction or otherwise in Spinco s reasonable good faith determination to maintain both (a) the pricing applicable to such Covered Parent PO, and (b) recovery by Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in such Covered Parent PO in accordance with Section 2(d)(i), then (b) shall be reduced accordingly. 
       
           3. 
    With respect to any Parent PO resulting from a Parent Future Bid that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission) more than ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time, in the event and to the extent it becomes impracticable due to customer reaction  or otherwise in Spinco s reasonable good faith determination to maintain both (a) the pricing applicable to such Parent PO, and (b) recovery by Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in such Parent PO in accordance with Section 2(d)(i), then (b) shall be reduced accordingly and any resulting reduction in (b) shall be deemed to be Damages to Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary, and Parent shall promptly indemnify and hold harmless Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary from and against the full amount of any such Damages. 
       
           4. 
    With respect to any Covered Parent PO, in the event and to the extent Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary incurs any penalty or price, cost recovery, or fee reduction due to a customer finding of excessive subcontracting pass-through resulting from consummation of the undertakings contemplated by the  

Transaction Documents, then Parent shall have no liability to Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary.  
    
           5. 
    With respect to any Parent PO resulting from a Parent Future Bid that is fully and finally submitted (it being understood that revisions may occur in connection with customer requests and negotiations following final proposal submission) more than ninety (90) days after the Distribution Effective Time, in the event and to the extent Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary incurs any penalty or price, cost recovery, or fee reduction due to a customer finding of excessive subcontracting pass-through resulting from consummation of the undertakings contemplated by the Transaction Documents, then any such penalty or reduction  shall be deemed to be Damages to Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary, and Parent shall promptly indemnify and hold harmless Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary from and against the full amount of any such Damages.  
       
           6. 
    Spinco shall (and Parent will cooperate with Spinco to) use reasonable efforts to convince the applicable customers that provisions for recovery by Spinco or the applicable Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs included in Parent POs in accordance with Section 2(d)(i) are related to the performance of subcontract management functions that constitute  Added Value  (as such term is defined in Section 52.215-23 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (October 2009)). 
       
           7. 
    For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the hold harmless and indemnification provisions in Cost Principles Paragraphs 3 and 5 above, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent from submitting any Parent Future Bids for 100% of the scope of a prospective Order by reason of a limitation on excessive subcontracting pass-through charges or any actual or anticipated impracticality of maintaining both the (a) pricing applicable to such Order or the associated Parent PO and (b) recovery by Spinco or the applicable Spinco Subsidiary of arms-length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs in accordance with Section 2(d)(i).

For continuity of reference, each Continuing IWTA shall bear the number or other identifying mark or reference of its predecessor IWTA unless and until another number, mark or reference is assigned to it by joint agreement of the Parties.  Notwithstanding that the Continuing IWTAs are all covered by this Agreement, the Parties intend and agree that each such Continuing IWTA is a separate agreement.   
  (b)        Estimates Used in Bids by the Spinco Business  .  Prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the Business Units submitted to the Spinco Business the estimates for work in support of the quotations, bids and proposals prepared by the Spinco Business, including those that are set forth on   Exhibit B   attached hereto (the    Continuing Government Bids   ).  In the event that Spinco or a Subsidiary of Spinco is awarded a Contract as a result of a Continuing Government Bid (either before or after the effective date of this Agreement), and to the extent no IWTA in respect of such Continuing Government Bid exists on the effective date of this Agreement, then Parent shall enter into a subcontract (a    Subcontract   ) with Spinco for the supply of Parent Products and Services consistent with the price or cost estimate supplied by the applicable Business Unit prior to the effective date of this Agreement, and on the same terms, conditions and provisions set forth herein applicable to Continuing IWTAs that would have applied if an IWTA with respect to the Contract that results from the Continuing Government Bid had been entered into by the applicable Business Unit and the Spinco Business as of the effective date of this Agreement.  The price of each Subcontract shall be determined on an arms  length basis based on the price or cost estimate previously supplied by the Business Unit in support of the applicable Continuing Government Bid and the principles set forth in   Section 3  . 
  (c)        Modifications and New Work  .  Modifications and change orders mutually agreed upon by the Parties that are not outside of the scope of work under the Continuing IWTAs and Subcontracts, such as changes in delivery schedule or destination, administrative changes and similar types of changes and modifications, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts.  For any new work, including work involving material changes in quantities or the nature of goods or services to be provided, that is not addressed in the previous sentence, the Parties may separately negotiate purchase orders not subject to this Agreement.   
  
   3 

(d)        Duty to Cooperate  .  The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to obtain any consents or approvals required by a Governmental Authority (including a customer under any Government Contract) required in connection with the entry into or performance of any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract.  If required or requested by any Governmental Authority, the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss alternative means to allow the Parties to fulfill their respective obligations under this Agreement. 
  (e)        Terms and Conditions  .  Parent shall cause the applicable Business Units to perform each Continuing IWTA and Subcontract in accordance with the respective drawings, specifications or scope of work set forth, or to be set forth, as the case may be, in such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as applicable, and in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as applicable.  The terms and conditions applicable to each Continuing IWTA and Subcontract are as set forth in items (i) through (iv) below.  Such terms and conditions are listed in the order they are to be given precedence in the event of a conflict: 
  (i)        the terms and conditions expressly set forth in this Agreement; 
  (ii)        the terms and conditions of the Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as the case may be, not including clauses (other than warranty clauses, mandatory FAR and DFARS flow-down clauses, and other provisions required for compliance purposes that are incorporated therein and shall continue in effect) from any prime Contract or higher tier subcontract that have been incorporated therein;  
  (iii)        all clauses, modified to reflect the changed parties, now existing or incorporated after the date hereof, in the prime Contract or higher tier subcontract under which any Continuing IWTA, or its predecessor IWTA, or Subcontract was or is issued that are required by such prime Contract or higher tier subcontract to be incorporated into Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts issued thereunder, when the requirement is expressly set forth in such clause, or when Spinco must impose the clause in order to comply with the terms of such prime Contract or higher tier subcontract, and any warranty terms in the prime Contracts or higher tier subcontracts; and   
  (iv)        the terms and conditions of the standard terms and conditions attached hereto as   Exhibit C   (the    Standard Terms and Conditions   ) other than the reference to the state law governing the agreement identified in Section 2(a) included in such Standard Terms and Conditions, which shall be disregarded, it being understood that Parent shall be the  Performing Company  and Spinco shall be the  Requesting Company  under the Standard Terms and Conditions. 
  Spinco shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any termination, waiver, amendment or modification of any prime Contract or higher tier subcontract under which any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract was or is issued that affects Parent s rights and obligations hereunder in any material respect.

  (b)        With respect to each Subcontract, Parent or the applicable Business Unit shall supply the Spinco Business with, and the Spinco Business shall pay Parent or the applicable Business Unit for, the Parent Products and Services at the costs and fees or prices set forth in the Subcontract (the    Subcontract Consideration    and, together with the IWTA Consideration, the    Initial Consideration   ).  The target cost for each Subcontract shall be based upon the price or cost estimate previously provided by the applicable Business Unit. 
    
  (c)        Spinco will, or will cause the applicable Spinco Subsidiary to, take reasonable best efforts to maintain each Continuing IWTA and each Subcontract within a cost segment that is generally compatible with the work being performed and the competitive environment of such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, broadly consistent with Spinco s general business practices. 
    
  (d)        For the avoidance of doubt, if, prior to the Distribution, any  memo fee  would have been payable to Parent or the applicable Business Unit in connection with any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, no such  memo fee  shall be paid to Parent or the applicable Business Unit as part of the Initial Consideration. 
    
  (e)        The following additional terms and conditions shall apply to certain Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts, as applicable: 
    
  (i)  Fee IWTAs.    With respect to each Continuing IWTA or Subcontract that is by its terms, performed at a fixed price or includes a fee (each, a    Fee IWTA   ), there shall be no adjustment to the Initial Consideration.

For purposes of this Agreement,    Spinco s Subcontract Management Cost    means, with respect to each Task Order IWTA, an amount equal to the costs of Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary in the nature of arms  length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs that appropriately and reasonably (consistent with past practice) take into account Applicable Law and the work to be performed by Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary pursuant to and during the term of such Task Order IWTA, but no Spinco fee or profit. 
  
   5 

(iii)  Cost IWTAs  .  With respect to each cost-reimbursable Continuing IWTA or Subcontract (A) for which no fee is charged pursuant to the terms of such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, and (B) is not a Task Order IWTA (each, a    Cost IWTA   ), Spinco shall pay to Parent or the applicable Business Unit an amount equal to Parent s or the applicable Business Unit s costs as set forth in such Cost IWTA, but no fee or profit. 
  (f)        Spinco shall be liable for, and shall pay to Parent or the applicable Business Unit, all amounts correctly invoiced by Parent or the applicable Business Unit to Spinco or its applicable Subsidiary for goods and services delivered by Parent or the applicable Business Unit under any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, and which are properly due and owing.

   7 

(d)        Disclosures Required by Applicable Law  .  In addition to the foregoing exceptions, in the event the Receiving Party is requested or required (by oral or written request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or by Applicable Law) to disclose any Proprietary Information, then the Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the Originating Party, at its expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this   Section 6  .  If, in the absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, required to disclose such Proprietary Information, the Receiving Party may so disclose the information;   provided   that the Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such information. 
  (e)        No Other Rights Granted  .  Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the Originating Party.

  (i)        Any decision or award of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be reasoned and in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

An application for such consolidation may be made by any party to this Agreement or such other Transaction Documents to the tribunal for the prior arbitration.  The tribunal to the prior arbitration shall, after providing all interested parties the opportunity to comment on such application, order that any such pending or contemplated arbitration be consolidated into a prior arbitration if it determines that (i) the issues in the arbitrations involve common questions of law or fact, (ii) no party to either arbitration shall be prejudiced, whether by delay or otherwise, by the consolidation, (iii) any party to the pending or contemplated arbitration which did not join an application for consolidation, or does not consent to such an application, is sufficiently related to the parties in the prior arbitration that their interests were sufficiently represented in the appointment of the tribunal for the prior arbitral tribunal, and (iv) consolidation would be more efficient that separate arbitral proceedings. 
  Section 20.        Consent to Jurisdiction  .  Any Proceeding seeking to obtain a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment or other order in aid of arbitration in connection with this Agreement shall and may be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, where such court does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware (   Delaware Courts   ), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to venue laid therein, any objection on the grounds of forum non conveniens, or any objection based on or on account of its place of incorporation or domicile, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such Proceeding in any Delaware Court (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto).  Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees that service or process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware, in any manner permitted by applicable law or, without limiting the foregoing, in the manner provided for notices in   Section 7  .

Section 2.        Purchase and Supply of Spinco Products and Services  . 
  (a)        Continuing IWTAs  .  During the term of this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the Spinco Business shall supply to the Business Units, and the Business Units shall purchase from the Spinco Business, the quantities of Spinco Products and Services that would have been provided, and at the prices that such Spinco Products and Services would have been provided, under those IWTAs existing on the date hereof between the applicable Business Unit and the Spinco Business (each, a    Continuing IWTA   ), and which are listed on   Exhibit A   attached hereto.  To the extent that any Continuing IWTA is based on an oral, informal, or otherwise unwritten agreement between the applicable Business Unit and the Spinco Business, such agreements shall be reduced to writing as soon as practicable.  Each Continuing IWTA shall be subject to and governed by the terms, conditions and provisions specified herein.  For continuity of reference, each Continuing IWTA shall bear the number or other identifying mark or reference of its predecessor IWTA unless and until another number, mark or reference is assigned to it by joint agreement of the Parties.  Notwithstanding that the Continuing IWTAs are all covered by this Agreement, the Parties intend and agree that each such Continuing IWTA is a separate agreement.   
  (b)        Estimates Used in Bids by the Business Units  .  Prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the Spinco Business submitted to the Business Units the estimates for work in support of the quotations, bids and proposals prepared by the Business Units, including those that are set forth on   Exhibit B   attached hereto (the    Continuing Government Bids   ).  In the event that a Business Unit is awarded a Contract as a result of a Continuing Government Bid (either before or after the effective date of this Agreement), and to the extent no IWTA in respect of such Continuing Government Bid exists on the effective date of this Agreement, then Spinco shall enter into a subcontract (a    Subcontract   ) with such Business Unit for the supply of Spinco Products and Services consistent with the price or cost estimate supplied by the Spinco Business prior to the effective date of this Agreement, and on the same terms, conditions and provisions set forth herein applicable to Continuing IWTAs that would have applied if an IWTA with respect to the Contract that results from the Continuing Government Bid had been entered into by the applicable Business Unit and the Spinco Business as of the effective date of this Agreement.  The price of each Subcontract shall be determined on an arms  length basis based on the price or cost estimate previously supplied by Spinco Business in support of the applicable Continuing Government Bid and the principles set forth in   Section 3  . 
  (c)        Modifications and New Work  .  Modifications and change orders mutually agreed upon by the Parties that are not outside of the scope of work under the Continuing IWTAs and Subcontracts, such as changes in delivery schedule or destination, administrative changes and similar types of changes and modifications, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts.  For any new work, including work involving material changes in quantities or the nature of goods or services to be provided, that is not addressed in the previous sentence, the Parties may separately negotiate purchase orders not subject to this Agreement.   
  
   3 

(d)        Duty to Cooperate  .  The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to obtain any consents or approvals required by a Governmental Authority (including a customer under any Government Contract) required in connection with the entry into or performance of any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract.  If required or requested by any Governmental Authority, the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss alternative means to allow the Parties to fulfill their respective obligations under this Agreement. 
  (e)        Terms and Conditions  .  The Spinco Business shall perform each Continuing IWTA and Subcontract in accordance with the respective drawings, specifications or scope of work set forth, or to be set forth, as the case may be, in such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as applicable, and in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as applicable.  The terms and conditions applicable to each Continuing IWTA and Subcontract are as set forth in items (i) through (iv) below.  Such terms and conditions are listed in the order they are to be given precedence in the event of a conflict: 
  (i)        the terms and conditions expressly set forth in this Agreement; 
  (ii)        the terms and conditions of the Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, as the case may be, not including clauses (other than warranty clauses, mandatory FAR and DFARS flow-down clauses, and other provisions required for compliance purposes that are incorporated therein and shall continue in effect) from any prime Contract or higher tier subcontract that have been incorporated therein;  
  (iii)        all clauses, modified to reflect the changed parties, now existing or incorporated after the date hereof, in the prime Contract or higher tier subcontract under which any Continuing IWTA, or its predecessor IWTA, or Subcontract was or is issued that are required by such prime Contract or higher tier subcontract to be incorporated into Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts issued thereunder, when the requirement is expressly set forth in such clause, or when Parent must impose the clause in order to comply with the terms of such prime Contract or higher tier subcontract, and any warranty terms in the prime Contracts or higher tier subcontracts; and   
  (iv)        the terms and conditions of the standard terms and conditions attached hereto as   Exhibit C   (the    Standard Terms and Conditions   ) other than the reference to the state law governing the agreement identified in   Section 2(a)   included in such Standard Terms and Conditions, which shall be disregarded, it being understood that Spinco shall be the  Performing Company  and Parent or the applicable Business Unit shall be the  Requesting Company  under the Standard Terms and Conditions. 
  Parent shall provide Spinco with prompt written notice of any termination, waiver, amendment or modification of any prime Contract or higher tier subcontract under which any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract was or is issued that affects Spinco s rights and obligations hereunder in any material respect. 
  
   4 

Section 3.        Pricing  .   
  (a)        With respect to each Continuing IWTA, the Spinco Business shall supply the applicable Business Units with, and the applicable Business Unit shall pay Spinco for, the Spinco Products and Services, at the same costs and fees or prices set forth in the Continuing IWTA (the    IWTA Consideration   ).   
    
  (b)        With respect to each Subcontract, Spinco shall supply the applicable Business Unit with, and the applicable Business Unit shall pay Spinco for, the Spinco Products and Services at the costs and fees or prices set forth in the Subcontract (the    Subcontract Consideration    and, together with the IWTA Consideration, the    Initial Consideration   ).  The target cost for each Subcontract shall be based upon the price or cost estimate previously provided by Spinco. 
    
  (c)        Parent will, or will cause the applicable Business Unit to, take reasonable best efforts to maintain each Continuing IWTA and each Subcontract within a cost segment that is generally compatible with the work being performed and the competitive environment of such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, broadly consistent with Parent s general business practices. 
    
  (d)        For the avoidance of doubt, if, prior to the Distribution, any  memo fee  would have been payable to Spinco in connection with any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, no such  memo fee  shall be paid to Spinco as part of the  Initial Consideration.   
    
  (e)        The following additional terms and conditions shall apply to certain Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts, as applicable: 
    
  (i)  Fee IWTAs.    With respect to each Continuing IWTA or Subcontract that is by its terms, performed at a fixed price or includes a fee (each, a    Fee IWTA   ), there shall be no adjustment to the Initial Consideration.  
  (ii)  IWTAs for IDIQ Task Orders  .  With respect to each cost-reimbursable Continuing IWTA or Subcontract that is for the performance of 100% of a task order under an IDIQ Contract of the Parent Companies (other than the Shared Contracts (Parent Companies)) (each, a    Task Order IWTA   ), Parent shall be liable for, and shall pay to Spinco, an amount equal to the aggregate fee paid by the ultimate end-customer in excess of the Parties  aggregate cost (it being understood that the Parties  aggregate cost includes Parent s Subcontract Management Cost).  For purposes of this Agreement,    Parent s Subcontract Management Cost    means, with respect to each Task Order IWTA, an amount equal to the costs of Parent or the applicable Business Unit in the nature of arms  length subcontract management, material handling and/or other actual costs that appropriately and reasonably (consistent with past practice) take into account Applicable Law and the work to be performed by Parent or the applicable Business Unit pursuant to and during the term of such Task Order IWTA, but no Parent fee or profit. 
  
   5 

(iii)  Cost IWTAs  .  With respect to each cost-reimbursable Continuing IWTA or Subcontract (A) for which no fee is charged pursuant to the terms of such Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, and (B) is not a Task Order IWTA (each, a    Cost IWTA   ), Parent shall pay to Spinco an amount equal to Spinco s costs as set forth in such Cost IWTA, but no fee or profit. 
  (f)        Parent shall be liable for, and shall pay to Spinco, all amounts correctly invoiced by Spinco to Parent or the applicable Business Unit for goods and services delivered by Spinco or the applicable Business Unit under any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, and which are properly due and owing. 
    
  Section 4.        Term  .  This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written and (a) with respect to each Continuing IWTA or Subcontract (other than any Cost IWTA) shall continue in effect until the expiration or termination, as the case may be, of each Continuing IWTA or Subcontract for the purchase and supply of Spinco Products and Services as contemplated by this Agreement and (b) with respect to each Continuing IWTA or Subcontract that is a Cost IWTA, shall continue in effect until the earlier of (x) the expiration or termination, as the case may be, of such Cost IWTA as contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the 12-month anniversary of the Distribution Date;   provided  ,   however  , that the provisions of   Sections 4   (Term), 5 (Use of Intellectual Property),   6   (Proprietary Information),   10   (Construction),   11   (Entire Agreement),   12     (Governing Law),   13   (Limitation of Liability),   17   (Third Party Beneficiaries),   19   (Dispute Resolution) and   20   (Consent to Jurisdiction), as well as the terms and conditions described in this Agreement or the Standard Terms and Conditions applicable to the respective Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts, which by their terms survive the termination of the Continuing IWTAs or Subcontracts, shall survive any such expiration.   
  Section 5.        Use of Intellectual Property  .  
  (a)        To the extent any Intellectual Property is developed by the Spinco Business in connection with the performance and delivery of Spinco Products and Services under this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to allocate ownership and use of such Intellectual Property based upon the intended use and application of such Intellectual Property in the Spinco Business and/or the Parent Business, as the case may be, based upon the following key principles: (i) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Spinco Business shall be transferred to the Spinco Companies, (ii) Intellectual Property with exclusive application to the Parent Business shall be retained by the Parent Companies with no grant of rights to the Spinco Companies, and (iii) Intellectual Property with application to both the Spinco Business and the Parent Business shall be retained by the Parent Companies and licensed to Spinco on a nonexclusive basis, in each case based on terms and conditions consistent with the similar provisions of the Separation Agreement and the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement with respect to Transferred Intellectual Property, Excluded Intellectual Property, Licensed Intellectual Property and Licensed-Back Intellectual Property, as the case may be. 
    
  (b)        Any transfer of Intellectual Property and/or grant of Intellectual Property rights pursuant to   Section 5(a)   shall be subject to any rights of any third party, including the U.S. Government, in such Intellectual Property, pursuant to Contract or otherwise. 
  
   6 

Section 6.        Proprietary Information  . 
  (a)        Definitions  .  The term    Proprietary Information    means all proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information that relates to and is disclosed by one Party or its Affiliates (the    Originating Party   ) to the other Party or its Affiliates (the    Receiving Party   ) under or in connection with this Agreement;   provided   that Proprietary Information shall not include Transferred Intellectual Property, Licensed Intellectual Property, Licensed-Back Intellectual Property or Spinco Business Proprietary Information, it being understood that such confidential information and data shall be protected and preserved by the Parties in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 
  (b)        Disclosure and Use  .  The Receiving Party (i) shall (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates to) treat and hold as confidential all Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party, and (ii) shall not (and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to) disclose to any Person, publish or make publicly available any Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party.  The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the Originating Party solely during the term of this Agreement and solely in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and, to the extent that Spinco is the Receiving Party, solely to the extent necessary in connection with the operation of the Spinco Business. 
  (c)        Exceptions  .  This Agreement shall not restrict disclosure or use of Proprietary Information that: 
  (i)        appears in issued patents, published patent applications or other publications that are generally available to the public;  
  (ii)        is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives or Affiliates; 
  (iii)        is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source that, to such Receiving Party s knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation; or  
  (iv)        is or has been independently developed by the Receiving Party as evidenced by written documentation;   provided   that Proprietary Information licensed to Parent by Spinco and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to have been independently developed by Spinco for purposes of this   Section 6(c)(iv)  ;        provided   that information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such information is embraced by more general information in the public domain, unless the information itself is in the public domain.   
  (d)        Disclosures Required by Applicable Law  .  In addition to the foregoing exceptions, in the event the Receiving Party is requested or required (by oral or written request  
  
   7 

for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or by Applicable Law) to disclose any Proprietary Information, then the Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the Originating Party, at its expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this   Section 6  .  If, in the absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, required to disclose such Proprietary Information, the Receiving Party may so disclose the information;   provided   that the Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such information. 
  (e)        No Other Rights Granted  .  Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the Originating Party.  Neither this Agreement nor disclosure of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any trade secrets, copyrights, inventions, patents or other Intellectual Property now or hereafter owned or controlled by either Party.   
  (f)        Non-Exclusive  .  The rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in this   Section 6   are in addition and subject to any additional or supplemental agreements with respect to confidentiality or protection of proprietary information that may be agreed between the Parties.

  (c)        Subject to   Section 13(a)  , the aggregate liability of Spinco under this Agreement, inclusive of any Continuing IWTA or Subcontract, whether arising in contract, tort, (including negligence) or restitution, or for breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall be limited to the value of the Continuing IWTA or Subcontract under which the claim of liability arises.

ARTICLE II      SERVICES PROVIDED 
  Section 2.01        The Services  . 
  (a)        Services  .  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent agrees to perform for Spinco and its Subsidiaries during the term of this Agreement those services (the    Services   ) identified on the various service schedules attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the    Service Schedules   ).  Parent may provide all or part of the Services (x) through one or more of its Affiliates, or (y) through an outsourcing or other third party provider arrangement, in the case of this clause (y) (i) to the extent such Services are provided to the Spinco Business on such a basis as of immediately prior to the Distribution, (ii) to the extent such Services are outsourced by, or obtained under a third party provider arrangement with, Parent and its Affiliates generally, or (iii) if the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are inapplicable, and if the applicable Service is material to the Spinco Business, to the extent Spinco shall consent in writing to any such outsourcing or third party provider arrangement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without limiting   Section 2.01(b)  , nothing in this Agreement shall require or be interpreted to require Parent or its Affiliates to provide a Service to Spinco or its Subsidiaries beyond the scope and content of such Service as provided (or caused to be provided) by Parent or its Affiliates to the Spinco Business during the 12 months prior to the Distribution.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Service Schedule, no Services provided under this Agreement shall include or shall be construed as constituting, accounting, legal or Tax advice or shall create any fiduciary obligations on the part of Parent or any of its Affiliates to any Person, including to Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any plan trustee or any customer of any of them. 
  (b)        Omitted Services  . In the event of any breach of the representation and warranty made by Parent and Spinco to RMT Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to   Section 4.19(a)   of the Merger Agreement (Sufficiency of Assets), to the extent such breach can be remedied by the provision of a Service hereunder (an    Omitted Service   ), then Parent shall provide such Omitted Service to the Spinco Companies to the extent required to remedy such breach.  The Parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to negotiate an agreement on the specific terms and conditions applicable to such Omitted Service (including a written Service Schedule with respect thereto, which Service Schedule shall include Parent s fees for such Omitted Service);   provided  , that (i) if such Omitted Service is substantially similar to any other Service provided under this Agreement, the specific terms and conditions (including fees therefor) shall be substantially similar to the specific terms and conditions applicable to such other Services, and (ii) if such Omitted Service is not substantially similar to any other Service hereunder, the specific terms and conditions (including fees therefor) shall be reasonable and consistent with what Parent or its applicable Affiliate charges its other Affiliates on a cost of service basis.  Upon the Parties  agreement on the specific terms and conditions applicable to an Omitted Service, such Omitted Service shall become a Service for purposes of this Agreement and the agreed upon Service Schedule therefor shall be deemed a Service Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement.   
  (c)        New Services  .  Spinco may from time to time during the term of this Agreement request in writing (a    New Service Request   ) that Parent perform a new service (that  
  
   3 

is not an Omitted Service) for Spinco and its Subsidiaries (a    New Service   ) in addition to the Services being provided hereunder.  Each New Service Request shall describe in reasonable detail (i) the type and scope of the New Service being requested, including a description of the work Spinco is requesting Parent to perform in respect of such New Service, (ii) the proposed schedule and service period for such New Service, (iii) any systems or equipment necessary for delivery of such New Service (to the extent Spinco is aware thereof), and (iv) any other terms and conditions applicable to such proposed New Service.  Upon receipt of a New Service Request, Parent, if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion to consider the provision of the New Service to Spinco and its Subsidiaries, shall enter into good faith negotiations with Spinco, for a period not to exceed 30 days, to develop a written Service Schedule with respect thereto, which Service Schedule shall include Parent s fees for such New Service.  If the Parties shall agree to a Service Schedule for the provision of a New Service under this Agreement, such New Service shall become a Service for purposes of this Agreement and the agreed upon Service Schedule therefor shall be deemed a Service Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement. 
  (d)        Standard of Performance  .  Except to the extent restricted by Applicable Law, contractual obligations, security requirements or similar restrictions, Parent shall provide the Services with substantially the same timeliness, quality, scope, service levels and standard of care as such Services generally were performed by or for the Spinco Business during the 12 months prior to the Distribution.   
  (e)        Temporary Suspension; Modification or Termination of Services  .  Parent shall have the right from time to time to shut down temporarily or suspend the operation of any systems or facilities necessary for the provision of any Service for modification, upgrade, maintenance or replacement, or for legal, compliance or security purposes, whenever in its reasonable judgment such action is necessary, and shall be relieved of its obligations to provide Services during the period that its systems or facilities are shut down or suspended. Parent shall provide reasonable advanced notice of any such shut downs or suspensions, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to the operation of the Spinco Business, in connection with any such shut down or suspension.   
  (f)        Termination of Services  . Parent shall have the right to terminate or discontinue any individual Service if Parent is terminating or discontinuing such Service to its business units or Affiliates in general;   provided  ,   however  , that Parent provides written notice to Spinco as reasonably practicable in advance (but in no event less than 90 days written days notice) of any such termination or discontinuation; and   provided     further   that Parent shall not have any right to terminate or discontinue any Service or Services during the initial term contemplated therefor on the Services Schedules hereto if the termination of such Service or Services, individually, or in the aggregate, would be material, in an adverse manner, to the businesses or operations of the Spinco Companies. 
  (g)        Significant Service or System Changes  .  Parent shall have the right to upgrade or replace its systems through which Services are being provided to Spinco as part of any upgrade or replacement made generally to its shared systems, business units or Affiliates.  In  
  
   4 

the case of any such upgrade or replacement (other than routine software upgrades), Parent shall notify Spinco in writing reasonably in advance of any such upgrade or replacement.  Subject to the provisions of this   Section 2.01(g)  , Spinco shall be responsible for its proportionate share of any costs, including security costs, incurred in implementing any such upgraded or replaced shared systems through which Services are being provided to Spinco and its Subsidiaries hereunder.  In the event Parent shall determine to upgrade or replace, during the term of this Agreement, any of its systems through which Services are being provided to Spinco under this Agreement, then, if and to the extent Parent and its Affiliates are required to incur additional or incremental costs or expenses (including capital expenditures) that Parent would not otherwise incur if such upgrade or replacement applied only to Parent s and its Affiliates  need for or use of such systems (including costs and expenses incurred as a result of the need to purchase additional capacity to accommodate the Spinco Business, incremental license or similar fees required to be paid to third parties or installation of security hardware and software items (e.g. firewalls) necessary to enable Parent to use such systems to provide Services to Spinco hereunder), then Spinco shall be responsible for such additional or incremental costs and expenses (including capital expenditures).  In such case, Parent shall provide a good faith estimate of Spinco s allocable share of the costs and expenses of any such upgrade or replacement in advance of such system replacement or upgrade.  Subject to the advance notice period and other requirements of   Section 5.02     (including with respect to interdependent Services), Spinco may discontinue any particular Services that use or are dependent on the systems to be upgraded or replaced and thereupon will not be responsible for costs and expenses related to such upgrade or replacement;   provided   that Spinco shall provide such notice of discontinuation to Parent no later than 30 days following Parent s notice to Spinco of such upgrade or replacement; and   provided     further   that nothing in this   Section 2.01(g)   shall relieve Spinco of any obligation to make payments in respect of Services received hereunder.        
  (h)        Parent Personnel  .   For the avoidance of doubt, all employees of Parent and its applicable Affiliates providing Services hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes to be employees or representatives of Parent or its applicable Affiliates and shall not be deemed to be employees or representatives of Spinco or any of its Affiliates for any purpose.  Without limiting the foregoing, Parent or its applicable Affiliate shall be responsible for (i) payment of compensation, benefits and labor costs (including workers  compensation obligations) attributable to such employees and (ii) withholding and remitting of Taxes with respect to such employees as required by Applicable Law.   
  (i)        Third Party Providers  .  Subject to   Section 2.01(a)  , to the extent any Service requires the use of a third party provider, at Spinco s election, Spinco may directly contract with such provider;   provided   that Spinco s election to directly contract with such a provider (i) shall not relieve Spinco of its obligations under this Agreement (including   Section 5.02  ) with respect to the termination of such Service, and (ii) shall relieve Parent of any and all obligations hereunder to provide such Service. Parent shall reasonably assist Spinco at Spinco s written request to enter into contracts with such third party providers that provide the Services to the Spinco Business prior to the Effective Date.  During the term of any Service provided by a third party provider, upon Spinco s written request describing any default of such third party Provider with respect to such Service, at Spinco s option, Parent shall either (x) to the extent permitted under the applicable Contract with  
  
   5 

respect third party Provider and consistent with Parent s other rights and obligations thereunder, assign such to Spinco any rights Parent or its Affiliates may have to any warranty, indemnity or other legal or equitable claim or cause of action under such Contract with respect to such Service, or (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any warranty or indemnity rights of Parent or its Affiliates under the applicable Contract with such third party provider on Spinco s behalf with respect to such Service.  Spinco shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with pursuing any such warranty or indemnity. The foregoing above is without prejudice to Spinco s or Parent s rights against or in respect of any such third party provider. 
  Section 2.02        Certain Spinco Obligations  . 
  (a)        Policies and Procedures; Use of Services  .  Spinco shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, adhere to applicable Parent policies and procedures relevant to the Services provided or made available to Spinco or that Spinco has in its possession.  Spinco shall use the Services only for substantially the same purpose and in substantially the same manner as the Spinco Business used the Services prior to the Distribution.   
  (b)        Cooperation; Information  .  Spinco agrees to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate as reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to perform the Services.  Spinco shall be responsible for providing certain information to Parent, or any Affiliate or designated third party provider engaged to perform particular Services, on a timely basis and in a format and with the level of detail reasonably acceptable to Parent or its Affiliate or designated third party provider, in each case solely to the extent necessary to enable Parent or its Affiliate or designated third party provider to provide Services under this Agreement and in a manner consistent with that required to be provided by the Spinco Business to receive such Service prior to the Distribution (to the extent applicable). 
  (c)        Migration  .  Spinco shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, endeavor to migrate off the Services as soon as is reasonably commercially practicable. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Spinco and its Affiliates to effect the transition of Services to Spinco, Merger Partner or its Affiliates, or any other qualified service provider as Spinco may designate from time to time to replace any of the Services under this Agreement. 
  (d)        Limited Use of Services  .  Spinco and its Subsidiaries shall use the Services only in connection with (i) the conduct of the Spinco Business in the ordinary course (together with natural extensions and growth of the Spinco Business during the term of this Agreement), (ii) separation of the Spinco Business from the remaining business of Parent and its Affiliates,  (iii) the separation of Spinco and its Subsidiaries from Parent s and its Affiliates  shared IT Systems, and (iv) the integration of Spinco and its Subsidiaries into the shared IT Systems of Merger Partner and its Affiliates.  Spinco and its Subsidiaries shall not resell, assign or subcontract any of the Services to any third party whatsoever or permit the use of the Services by any third party other than Spinco and its Subsidiaries, or Merger Partner or its Affiliates solely in connection with operation of the Spinco Business, in accordance with this Agreement.  
  
   6 

(e)        Limited License  .  The Parties agree that certain third party licenses or other agreements, software or hardware required for use by Parent, its Affiliates and designated third party providers in providing Services to Spinco and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement may be Transferred Assets under the Separation Agreement. To the extent required to deliver the Services as contemplated in this Agreement, Spinco hereby grants and licenses to Parent, its applicable Affiliates and any applicable designated third party providers, the right to possess, access and use such Transferred Assets solely to the extent necessary for rendering Services under and in accordance with this Agreement, including connecting such Transferred Assets to IT Systems of Parent and its Affiliates.  
  Section 2.03        Ingress and Egress  .  Spinco hereby grants to Parent, at all times during the term of this Agreement, the right to ingress to and egress from the premises occupied by Spinco, subject to such restrictions as Spinco may reasonably require (including written non-disclosure agreements, restricted access for only designated areas, and other requirements, with any individuals who will enter such premises), for reasonable purposes and solely to the extent necessary to the delivery of Services hereunder or the exercise of any right under this Agreement or the performance of any obligations required by this Agreement. 
  Section 2.04        Priorities  .  As to the provision of Services, Parent shall determine the priority of any Services provided under this Agreement in a fair and reasonable manner and taking into account the interests of the Parties, as between Parent or any of its Affiliates, and Spinco and its Subsidiaries, including taking into account the relative effect of such determination on their respective businesses and operations. 
  Section 2.05        Limitations on Services  .  Spinco acknowledges that Parent is agreeing to perform Services in order to facilitate Spinco s and its Subsidiaries  operation of the Spinco Business as described in the Separation Agreement and Merger Agreement and as otherwise provided herein.  Parent shall not be required to expand its facilities, incur any capital expenditures, employ additional personnel or maintain the employment of any specific persons in order to provide the Services to Spinco or its Subsidiaries.    
  Section 2.06        Separation and Migration  .  In the event and to the extent the Separation/Migration Plan has not been developed or finalized by the Parties prior to the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall develop or finalize the Separation/Migration Plan as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement.

  Section 2.07        Intellectual Property  .  Pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement and the Transaction Documents, Parent has agreed to transfer to one or more of the Spinco Companies certain Transferred Intellectual Property and to license to one or more of the Spinco Companies certain Licensed Intellectual Property.  In connection with the performance of the Services hereunder, Spinco may have access to or use of certain Intellectual Property disclosed or licensed by third parties to Parent or its Affiliates that is not Transferred Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property (   Third Party Intellectual Property   ) as well as certain Intellectual Property owned by Parent or its Affiliates that is not Transferred Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property (   Other Parent Intellectual Property   ).  To the extent necessary or appropriate to protect any such Third Party Intellectual Property or Other Parent Intellectual Property, Spinco shall enter into non-disclosure agreements with third parties or take other reasonable actions with respect to such Third Party Intellectual Property or Other Parent Intellectual Property as may be reasonably requested by Parent (with respect to the Other Parent Intellectual Property) or such third parties (with respect to the Third Party Intellectual Property) from time to time.  Parent hereby grants, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to Spinco and its Subsidiaries a license to access and use such Intellectual Property solely to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with receiving and fully utilizing the Services under and in accordance with this Agreement.  Other than as permitted by this Agreement, Spinco shall not have any rights in or to any such Third Party Intellectual Property or Other Parent Intellectual Property as a result of any such access or use.  Spinco shall comply in all respects with the terms and conditions of any agreement between any third parties and Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to the extent such agreements have been provided to Spinco prior to the Effective Date, with respect to any Third Party Intellectual Property disclosed to or used by Spinco as if Spinco were a direct party to such arrangements (other than with respect to any payment terms thereunder), including any obligations with respect to confidentiality and restrictions on use of Third Party Intellectual Property. Spinco assumes all liability associated with any breach of any terms and conditions of any agreement or other arrangement between any third parties and Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the Services, and without limiting the rights of Parent under the Separation Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, hereby indemnifies pursuant to   Section 6.04(a)   each of Parent, its Affiliates and its Representatives (together with their respective successors and permitted assigns) against, and agrees to defend and hold them harmless from, any and all Damages suffered by any of them to the extent arising out of, resulting from or related to any claim that Spinco s access to or use of Third Party Intellectual Property violates the Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person, or breaches a term or condition of any arrangement between Parent or its Affiliates and any third party.  Without limiting the foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed that Spinco shall not have any rights in or access to, and Parent shall ensure that no copies are provided to Spinco or any of its Affiliates of, any source code with respect to any Third Party Intellectual Property or Other Parent Intellectual Property.  Spinco shall not, through reverse engineering or any other means, attempt to access any such source code and shall use the Third Party Intellectual Property and the Other Parent Intellectual Property only for its intended use.

Section 2.08        Telecommunications Matters  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Services Schedules, the Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to all telecommunications Services provided under this Agreement (as are specifically designated on the applicable Services Schedules), Parent is only acting to pass through such Services from the applicable telecommunications service vendor, and shall not be deemed to be providing such telecommunications Services to the Spinco Companies or any of the Spinco Business Employees.   
  ARTICLE III     CONSIDERATION 
  Section 3.01        Consideration  .  Spinco shall pay Parent, in consideration of each of the Services provided hereunder, the amounts set forth in the applicable Service Schedules hereto.  For the avoidance of doubt, all such amounts under this Agreement are independent of, and in addition to, any costs and expenses required to be paid or reimbursed by Spinco or its Affiliates under the other Transaction Documents that relate to the scope and content of any Service, including all such costs and expenses under the Employee Matters Agreement;   provided  ,   however  , that Spinco shall not be obligated to pay more than once for any Service under this Agreement that is also being provided in any other Transaction Document. 
  Section 3.02        Costs and Expenses  .  Spinco shall pay Parent such amounts as may be necessary to reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for certain fees, costs or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with performing the Services (excluding Taxes, except as explicitly provided herein) in accordance with the principles described in   Exhibit B  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of this   Section 3.02   or   Exhibit B  , it is acknowledged and agreed that Spinco shall pay and reimburse Parent for (a) all fees, expenses and other amounts paid to third parties in connection with the provision of Services hereunder, (b) incremental license or similar fees paid to third parties, including software vendors or licensors, as a result of the provision of Services to Spinco and its Subsidiaries, (c) Spinco s proportionate share of costs associated with systems maintenance and periodic upgrades of system hardware or software reasonably necessary to provide the Services, and (d) Spinco s proportionate share of any costs (including security costs) incurred in implementing upgraded or replaced shared systems in accordance with   Section 2.01(g)  .     
  Section 3.03        Required Consents  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to provide any Service to the extent the provision of such Service in accordance with this Agreement would require any consent, waiver, permit, license, and or sublicense of any third party (collectively, the    Required Consents   ) unless and until such Required Consents shall have been obtained.  With respect to any Required Consents not obtained prior to the date of this Agreement, from and after the date hereof, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but without any payment of money or other transfer of value by Parent to any third party) to obtain such Required Consents and Spinco shall provide such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with its pursuit of such Required Consents.  To the extent Parent can obtain a Required Consent by adding Spinco or its Subsidiaries to a list of approved or authorized users of software, hardware  
  
   9 

or services used to provide Services hereunder, Parent shall prepare such documents and Spinco agrees to cooperate with Parent to execute such documents provided that the terms and conditions of such documents are reasonably satisfactory to Spinco.  Should a sublicense, temporary assignment or signature on any software license or confidentiality agreements be necessary for Parent to be authorized to provide the Services, Spinco also agrees to cooperate and execute such documents provided that the terms and conditions of such documents are reasonably satisfactory to Spinco.  The failure of Spinco to execute any of the documents referred to in this   Section 3.03   shall relieve Parent of its duty to provide the portion of the Services to which the Required Consent would have applied.  Without limiting the provisions of   Section 3.02  , Spinco shall pay Parent such amounts as may be necessary to reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for any fees, costs or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with seeking and obtaining any Required Consents, including any consent fees, license fees or other amounts assessed by any third party in connection therewith. 
  Section 3.04        Invoices  .  Parent shall bill Spinco on a monthly basis for Services provided under this Agreement and for Parent s reimbursable costs and expenses in connection therewith as further set forth in the Service Schedules.  With respect to fees, costs and expenses incurred prior to the date of this Agreement that are reimbursable pursuant to   Section 3.02   (including in accordance with the principles in   Exhibit B  ), to the extent such amounts have not been paid by Spinco prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent shall invoice such amounts under this Agreement.  Spinco shall pay the amount of each invoice in immediately available funds within 30 days of the date thereof.  If any amounts due hereunder have not been received by the due date and are not disputed in good faith, the overdue amounts shall bear interest from the due date at the Interest Rate until received.  If Spinco disputes in good faith any portion of the amount due on any invoice, Spinco shall notify Parent in writing (including the nature and basis of the dispute) no later than the payment due date for such invoice. The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve the dispute as promptly as practicable. Upon the resolution of any dispute, the applicable Party will refund to the other Party the amount that has been agreed by such Party, and any amounts so refunded shall bear interest from the due date at the Interest Rate until received.  Spinco shall pay, as additional fees, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent in attempting to collect and collecting the amounts due under this   Section 3.04   (including all reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses).  Any invoice provided under this Agreement shall include the following language:  With respect to all telecommunications services provided under this invoice, Lockheed Martin Corporation is only acting to pass through such services from the applicable telecommunications service vendor, and shall not be deemed to be providing such telecommunications services to Abacus Innovations Corporation or any of its employees.    
  Section 3.05        Taxes.   
  (a)        The consideration payable to Parent pursuant to   Section 3.01   shall, except as otherwise provided in this   Section 3.05  , exclude any and all Taxes imposed on the sale of the Services provided by Parent, and any and all Taxes otherwise imposed on, sustained or incurred with respect to, or applicable to, the Services provided by Parent; provided that Spinco shall pay  
  
   10 

all sales, use and other similar Taxes arising as a result of or in connection with the provision of the Services or the performance of the obligations under this Agreement. 
  (b)        Parent shall cooperate with Spinco and take any reasonably requested action in order to minimize any sales, use or other similar Taxes imposed on the sale of the Services provided by Parent, including providing sales and use Tax exemption certificates or other documentation necessary to support Tax exemptions.

  (c)        Spinco or any applicable Affiliate of Spinco, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under Applicable Law and such deducted and withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made;   provided  ,   however  , that Spinco will reasonably cooperate with Parent in obtaining any available exemption from or reduction of such withholding. 
  Section 3.06        Records  .  Parent shall keep reasonable and accurate records pertaining to the amounts billed to Spinco under this Agreement in accordance with Applicable Law (and at a minimum a period of up to four years after the termination of the last Service under this Agreement).  Parent shall provide Spinco and its Representatives with reasonable access (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) to such records during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice during the term of this Agreement to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Spinco or its Representatives to audit the amount billed under this Agreement. 
  ARTICLE IV      FORCE MAJEURE  
  Section 4.01        Force Majeure  .  Neither Party shall be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever arising out of any delay or failure in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (other than the payment of money) to the extent such delay or failure results from events beyond the control of the affected Party, including acts of God, acts, regulations or decrees of any Governmental Authority, war, acts of terrorism, embargoes, strikes, industrial disputes or shortages of fuel, other industry-wide shortages of labor or supply of materials, accident, fire, explosion, flood, nuclear disaster or riot, and Spinco shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement in respect of any such delay or failure resulting from any such event. In such an event, the affected Party shall immediately notify the other Party thereof, and each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate such event insofar as possible with a minimum of delay and to resume performance as soon as and to the extent practicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spinco shall have the right to terminate the affected Service (the    Affected Service   ) in the event of any such delay or failure affecting such Affected Service that continues for longer than 60 days;   provided   that Spinco shall provide at least 30 days prior  
  
   11 

written notice of termination of such Affected Service; and   provided     further   that to the extent any such Affected Service is interdependent with any other Service provided hereunder, termination of such Affected Service shall be subject to termination of any interdependent Services in accordance with (and subject to the notice periods contemplated by)   Section 5.02   unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.   
  ARTICLE V      TERM AND TERMINATION 
  Section 5.01        Term  .  This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, shall continue in effect with respect to each Service for the term of such Service specified on the Service Schedule with respect thereto;   provided   that, notwithstanding the term of any Service set forth in the Service Schedules, but subject to the provisions of this   Section 5.01  , this Agreement shall terminate in its entirety on the 12-month anniversary of the Distribution.  To the extent reasonably necessary to continue the transition of any Service contemplated herein from Parent or its Affiliates to other providers (including Spinco or its Affiliates) and the continued operation of Spinco s and its Subsidiaries  business in connection therewith, Spinco may elect, by delivering written notice to Parent no later than three months prior to the end of the then in effect term for such Service, to extend any Service (and, as necessary, the term of this Agreement with respect to such Service) by (a) an initial extension period of up to six months;   provided  , that for and during such additional period, all costs and fees hereunder (other than third-party costs and expenses) shall be increased by 6%, and (b) a second extension period of up to six months;   provided  , that for and during such second additional period, all costs and fees hereunder (other than third-party costs and expenses) shall be increased by 12%;   provided  , that for the avoidance of doubt it is acknowledged and agreed that, in the case of each of clause (a) and clause (b), Spinco shall be responsible for all third-party costs and expenses in connection with, including additional or increased costs and expenses as a result of, any such extension.  It is acknowledged and agreed that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Service may be extended beyond the initial period contemplated therefor to the extent such extension would constitute a violation of Applicable Law or a violation of, conflict with or default under the terms and conditions of any Contract with any third party related thereto, (ii) no telecommunications services of the type that Parent determines may give rise to the imposition of excise Taxes or other similar communications Taxes shall in any event be extended longer than a maximum period of 12 months, (iii) no Service that is indicated as not subject to extension on the Services Schedules may be extended beyond the term therefor indicated in the Services Schedules, (iv) the extension of an individual Service shall require the extension of all interdependent Services (including (A) with respect to any Service that is designated as part of a bundle in any Service Schedule, extension of all Services included in such bundle and (B) any Services identified as being interdependent on the Service Schedules), and (v) this Agreement shall terminate in its entirety in any event upon the earlier of (A) the expiration of the last extension period exercised by Spinco under this   Section 5.01   and (B) the 24-month anniversary of the Distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, if any telecommunications service is extended longer than a maximum period of 12 months, costs and fees with respect to such services shall include (x) any excise Taxes imposed on Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with such services, and (y) any Taxes on the amounts described in (x).

Section 5.02        Partial Termination  .  Spinco may discontinue one or more particular Services from time to time during the term of this Agreement by delivering to Parent advance written notice of termination thereof no later than 90 days prior to the date of termination of such Service (unless the Service Schedule for such Service shall designate a longer advanced termination period, in which case Spinco shall provide written notice in accordance with such period).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a particular Service may be discontinued only upon discontinuation of all related interdependent Services (including with respect to any Service that is designated as part of a bundle in any Service Schedule, upon discontinuation of all Services included in such bundle), and (b) no termination of any Service shall relieve Spinco of any of its obligations hereunder to pay Parent for Services rendered and costs and expenses incurred prior to such termination.  For those Services that are part of a process or system approved by the U.S. Government, Spinco agrees that it shall have an approved alternative system or process in place prior to termination of such Services.  In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may terminate any Service, effective immediately upon delivery of notice to Spinco, (i) if and to the extent the provision or receipt of such Service is prohibited by Applicable Law, subjects Parent or any of its Affiliates to increased regulation by any Governmental Authority or requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to obtain any license or permit from any Governmental Authority not otherwise required to be obtained by Parent in connection with its other businesses, and (ii) in accordance with   Section 2.01(f)  .  In the event Spinco shall terminate any Service provided hereunder earlier than the designated term thereof as set out in the Service Schedules, and if such early termination shall result in an early termination fee or similar penalty to Parent or its Affiliates, Spinco shall be responsible for such fee or penalty to the extent Spinco requests in writing, prior to such termination, that Parent notify Spinco in writing of any such fee or penalty and, upon receipt of such notice from Parent, Spinco determines to terminate despite such fee or penalty.   
  Section 5.03        Termination of Entire Agreement  .  Each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon delivery of notice to the other Party if: (a) the other Party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or is petitioned into bankruptcy, or takes advantage of any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency act, or if a receiver or receiver/manager is appointed for all or any substantial part of its property and business and such receiver or receiver/manager remains undischarged for a period of 30 days; (b) the other Party materially defaults in the performance of any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement and such default is not remedied within 60 days (or such longer period to the extent the defaulting Party is using diligent efforts to remedy the same) after written notice of such default by the non-breaching Party;   provided   that the terminating Party shall only have the right to terminate the applicable Service(s) affected by such default, or (c) all Services have been terminated or expired in accordance herewith. 
  Section 5.04        Suspension of Services  .  Parent s obligations to perform Services under this Agreement are conditioned upon Spinco materially complying at all times with its covenants and obligations in this Agreement necessary for Parent to provide such Services. If at any time Spinco shall not be in material compliance with any such covenants and obligations hereunder, Parent may suspend performance of any Services affected by or related to such noncompliance.   
  
   13 

Section 5.05        Procedures on Termination  .  Following any termination of this Agreement in whole or in part, each Party shall provide reasonable cooperation to the other Party in connection with the cessation of the provision of Services hereunder to minimize disruption to the Spinco Business;   provided   that this   Section 5.05   shall not require Parent to provide Services beyond the termination of such Service or this Agreement or to incur any unreimbursed costs or expenses.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any right to payment for Services provided prior to termination.  Reasonably prior to and for a reasonable period of time following such termination (in each case not less than 30 days), Parent shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Spinco with respect to transitioning the Spinco Companies and Spinco Business from the terminated Services to long-term replacement services;   provided   that such cooperation shall not require Parent to incur any unreimbursed costs or expenses.

Upon completion or termination of the Services and unless instructed to do otherwise by the Originating Party, the Receiving Party shall use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to cease use of and destroy all of the Proprietary Information, if any, received from the Originating Party pursuant to this Agreement (except to the extent stored in archival or other backup systems of the Receiving Party;   provided   that the confidentiality and non-use restrictions hereunder shall continue to apply to such Proprietary Information).  The Originating Party may request, within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, and the Receiving Party shall provide, written certification of the destruction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may retain one copy of each permanent record of the Proprietary Information disclosed to it under this Agreement solely as a record of the disclosure.   
  (i)        Non-Exclusive  .  The rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in this   Section 7.01   are in addition to any additional or supplemental agreements with respect to confidentiality or protection of proprietary information that may be agreed between the Parties.

To the extent Parent or its Affiliates, in connection with the performance of any Service hereunder, develops, conceives or generates any invention, discovery, improvement, maskwork, patent, work of authorship or other Intellectual Property, or any proprietary, confidential or trade secret data, all right, title and interest in and to such inventions, discoveries, improvements, maskworks, patents and other Intellectual Property and such proprietary, confidential or trade secret data will be owned solely by Parent or its respective Affiliates, as the case may be, notwithstanding its development in connection with performance of Services under this Agreement and Spinco shall not have any rights therein or thereto.    
  Section 7.03        Control over Data and Technology  .  Spinco agrees to comply and to cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent agrees to comply and to cause its Affiliates to, comply with all applicable International Trade Laws and Regulations (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the United States and any other country having proper jurisdiction and, without limiting the foregoing, shall obtain all necessary export licenses, in connection with any export, re-export, transfer or use of all products, technology, and intellectual property licensed under or used pursuant to this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, for as long as Spinco and its Subsidiaries have access to Parent s IT Systems and data, Spinco shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and for as long as Parent and its Affiliates have access to Spinco s IT Systems and data, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, allow disclosure of technical data, classified or proprietary information to a foreign entity (not incorporated in the U.S.), or foreign national who is not a U.S. lawful permanent resident (intending citizen/green card holder) unless the applicable Party has obtained proper export authorization, and shall not allow a foreign entity or foreign national to access Parent s or Spinco s (as applicable) IT Systems without Parent s or Spinco s (as applicable) prior written authorization.

Section 7.04        Equipment and Network Access  .  The Parties agree that, if any equipment included among the Transferred Assets will remain connected to Parent s network during the term of this Agreement, then Parent will continue to have operational control of such equipment for so long as such equipment remains connected to Parent s network and such equipment shall not be connected to Spinco s or its Subsidiaries  networks during such period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof.  The Parties agree that use of, and access related to, any equipment connected to the other Party s network shall be subject to all applicable computing security policies of such other Party while it is connected to such other Party s network, including policies concerning electronic access by such Party and its Affiliates.  Such other Party will control electronic access to its network, including by issuing accounts to such number of personnel who need to access the information on the network for purposes associated with Services being performed hereunder or, with respect to Spinco and its Subsidiaries as the accessing Party, other operation of the Spinco Business.  Each Party will take necessary and appropriate measures to reasonably assure that its and its Affiliates  personnel utilize such access consistent with restrictions placed on their individual network access account.  Each Party also agrees to reasonably cooperate with any investigation of a suspected or detected breach of security or incident of misuse by the other Party. The Parties further agree that, prior to physical transfer of the equipment to Spinco or its Subsidiaries, Parent may (i) erase or overwrite any residual data on storage media that constitutes an Excluded Asset but is part of such equipment, provided that these activities shall only occur after any of Spinco s or its Subsidiaries  proprietary information is removed and backed up, or (ii) remove and replace, before the transfer of the equipment to Spinco or its Subsidiaries, any storage media containing information which is considered proprietary to Parent;   provided   that (A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for the full restoration of all of Spinco s or its Subsidiaries  proprietary information and equipment without any loss of information or functionality, (B) Parent shall implement its duties in accordance with   Section 2.01(d)  , and (C) no such erasing, overwriting, removal or replacement shall occur with respect to any Data or Intellectual Property to the extent a Spinco has a Right to Use such Data in accordance with   Section 2.10   of the Separation Agreement or license rights to such Intellectual Property under the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that additional conditions and restrictions may apply to satisfy governmental restrictions for any equipment subject to a U.S. Government security classification. Notwithstanding Parent s control of Spinco s and its Subsidiaries  equipment while it is connected to Parent s network, all risk of loss as to such equipment will be allocated to Spinco and its Subsidiaries.

  (c)        The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

Any arbitrator not timely appointed as provided herein shall be appointed by the AAA.  For the avoidance of doubt, each of the claimant and the respondent in the arbitration shall be permitted to consult with its respective appointed arbitrator in connection with such arbitrators  selection of the third arbitrator. 
  (e)        The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the exclusive right to determine the arbitrability of any Disputes. 
  (f)        The parties shall share equally the arbitration administrative fees, the panel member fees and costs, and any other costs associated with the arbitration.  Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys  fees. The Arbitral Tribunal shall have no authority to award damages in excess of any limitations set forth in this Agreement. 
  (g)        The Arbitral Tribunal shall be required to apply the substantive laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof that would compel the laws of another jurisdiction) in ruling upon any Dispute.

Despite such action, the Parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this   Section 8.13  . 
  (i)        Any decision or award of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be reasoned and in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

The Parties also agree that judgment upon the arbitral decision or award may be entered and enforced in any court where the parties to the arbitration proceeding or their assets may be found (to whose jurisdiction the parties consent for the purpose of entering and enforcing judgment on the arbitral decision and award) as well as any other court having jurisdiction thereof. 
  (j)        If any prevailing party is required to retain counsel to enforce the arbitral decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Party against whom the decision or award  
  
   24 

is made shall reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred and paid to said counsel for such service.

  (l)        The Parties agree that notifications of any proceedings, reports, communications, orders, arbitral decisions, arbitral awards, arbitral award enforcement petitions, and any other document shall be sent as set forth in   Section 8.01  .  
  (m)        The parties consent that any pending or contemplated arbitration hereunder may be consolidated with any prior arbitration arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the Merger Agreement or the Tax Matters Agreement) for the purposes of efficiency and to avoid the possibility of inconsistent awards.  An application for such consolidation may be made by any party to this Agreement or such other Transaction Documents to the tribunal for the prior arbitration.  The tribunal to the prior arbitration shall, after providing all interested parties the opportunity to comment on such application, order that any such pending or contemplated arbitration be consolidated into a prior arbitration if it determines that (i) the issues in the arbitrations involve common questions of law or fact, (ii) no party to either arbitration shall be prejudiced, whether by delay or otherwise, by the consolidation, (iii) any party to the pending or contemplated arbitration which did not join an application for consolidation, or does not consent to such an application, is sufficiently related to the parties in the prior arbitration that their interests were sufficiently represented in the appointment of the tribunal for the prior arbitral tribunal, and (iv) consolidation would be more efficient that separate arbitral proceedings. 
  Section 8.14        Consent to Jurisdiction  .  Any Proceeding seeking to obtain a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment or other order in aid of arbitration in connection with this Agreement shall and may be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, where such court does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware (   Delaware Courts   ), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to venue laid therein, any objection on the grounds of forum non conveniens, or any objection based on or on account of its place of incorporation or domicile, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such Proceeding in any Delaware Court (and of the appropriate appellate courts thereto).  Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees that service of process in any such Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware, in any manner permitted by Applicable Law or, without limiting the foregoing, in the manner provided for notices in   Section 8.01  .
