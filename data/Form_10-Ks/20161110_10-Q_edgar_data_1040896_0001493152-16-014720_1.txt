 NATURE OF BUSINESS    

Business   

Intellicheck
Mobilisa, Inc. (the  Company  or  Intellicheck ) is a leading technology company that is engaged in developing,
integrating and marketing threat identification and identity authentication solutions to address challenges that include retail
fraud prevention, law enforcement threat identification, and mobile and handheld access control and security for the government,
military and commercial markets. Intellicheck s products include Retail ID , the industry leading solution for preventing
fraud in the retail industry; Age ID , a smartphone or tablet-based solution for preventing sale of age-restricted products
to minors; Law ID , a smartphone-based solution used by law enforcement officers to identify and mitigate threats; and Defense
ID , a mobile and fixed infrastructure solution for threat identification, identity authentication and access control to military
bases and other government facilities.  

Intellicheck
continues to develop and release innovative products based upon its rich patent portfolio consisting of over 25 patents.  

Liquidity   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,645,529 and used cash in operations of $3,470,783.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,534,399 and an accumulated deficit of $103,279,274.
Based on our business plan and, cash resources, we expect our existing and future resources and revenues generated from operations
to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.  

However,
if performance expectations fall short or expenses exceed expectations, the Company may need to secure additional financing or
reduce expenses to continue operations. Failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. There
can be no assurance that any contemplated additional financing will be available on terms acceptable, if at all. If required,
the Company believes it would be able to reduce expenses to a sufficient level to continue as a going concern.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mobilisa, Inc. ( Mobilisa )
and Positive Access Corporation ( Positive Access ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
upon consolidation.  

2.
 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments necessary for
a fair presentation of the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stockholders  equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.
Interim financial statements are prepared on a basis consistent with the Company s annual financial statements. Results
of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

The
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include
all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
financial statements.  

References
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  authoritative guidance  is to the Accounting Standards Codification issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ).  

For
further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) . ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB )
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards ( IFRS ). ASU 2014-09 applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods
or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in the first quarter
of 2018. Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2017 for public companies. The Company is currently evaluating
the requirements of ASU 2014-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements and expects to
be completed by December 31, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company s
financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
statements include the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, valuation of intangible assets, deferred tax valuation allowances,
and the fair value of stock options granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans. Due to the inherent uncertainties
involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
There were no cash equivalents held on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

The
Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company s customers, current economic conditions
and other factors that may affect customers  ability to pay.  

Inventory   

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market and cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is primarily comprised
of finished goods. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the majority of inventory is related to Government and Commercial
Identity products for intended near-term sales.  

Goodwill   

Goodwill
represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Pursuant to ASC
Topic 350, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or between annual tests, in certain
circumstances. Under guidance, the Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform
the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit
unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than
its carrying amount. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include macroeconomic conditions,
industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity specific events and sustained decrease
in share price.  

Intangible
Assets   

Intangible
assets include trade names, patents developed technology non-contractual customer relationships. The Company uses the straight
line method to amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable in
accordance with ASC Topic 360. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that
future undiscounted net cash flows, without interest charges, will be less than the carrying amount of the assets. There were
no impairment charges recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using expected tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty of the realizability of those assets.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company adheres to the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . This pronouncement
requires that the Company calculate the fair value of financial instruments and include this additional information in the notes
to financial statements when the fair value is different than the book value of those financial instruments. The Company s
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, note receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company s financial instruments approximated fair
value, due to their short-term nature.  

Revenue
Recognition and Deferred Revenue   

Revenue
is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable,
collectability is probable, and there is no future Company involvement or commitment. The Company sells its commercial products
directly through its sales force and through distributors. Revenue from direct sales of products is recognized when shipped to
the customer and title has passed.  

Under
the provisions of ASC Topic 605-25,  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,  for multi-element arrangements
that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software
elements relating to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based
on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used
for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ). VSOE generally exists only when the
Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the
Company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.  

The
Company also recognizes revenues from licensing of its patented software to customers. The licensed software requires continuing
service or post contractual customer support and performance; accordingly, a portion of the revenue is deferred based on its fair
value and recognized ratably over the period in which the future service, support and performance are provided, which is generally
one to three years. Royalties from the licensing of the Company s technology are recognized as revenues in the period they
are earned.  

The
Company also performs consulting work for other companies. These services are billed on a time and materials basis. Revenue from
these arrangements is also recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased.  

Subscriptions
to database information can be purchased for month-to-month, one, two, and three year periods. Revenue from subscriptions are
deferred and recognized over the contractual period, which is typically three years.  

The
Company offers enhanced extended warranties for its sales of hardware and software at a set price. The revenue from these sales
are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual period, which is typically one to four years.  

Business
Concentrations and Credit Risk    

During
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company made sales to three customers that accounted for approximately
35% and 26% of total revenues, respectively. The revenue was associated with two commercial identity sales customers and one Defense
ID customer. These customers represented 32% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. During the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company made sales to two customers that accounted for approximately 51% and 40% of total
revenues, respectively. The revenue was associated with one commercial identity customer and one Defense ID customer. These customers
represented 51% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2015.  

Net
Loss Per Share   

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation
of diluted net loss per share excludes all anti-dilutive shares.  

The
following table summarizes the common stock equivalents excluded from loss per diluted share because their effect would be anti-dilutive:  

The
above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment
of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management s
judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result.  

3.
 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL   

The
changes in the carrying amount of intangible assets for nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

The
following summarizes amortization of intangible assets included in the statement of operations:  

4.
 NOTE RECEIVABLE   

On
August 31, 2015, the Company sold the wireless enterprise assets to the Jamestown S Klallam Tribe (the  Buyer )
for total consideration of $350,000 which consists of an upfront cash payment of $30,000, the issuance of a promissory note totaling
$200,000 and contingent consideration up to a maximum of $120,000 based on future earnings. Under the terms of the promissory
note, monthly payments of $3,683 including principal and interest at 4%, are to be made over a 60-month term expiring in August
2020. At September 30, 2016, the total note receivable is $159,990, of which $38,513 and $121,477 is included in Other Current
Assets and Notes Receivable, net of current portion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2015, the
total note receivable is $187,861, of which $37,365 and $150,496 is included in other current assets and Notes Receivable, net
of current portion, respectively on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

5.
 DEBT   

Revolving
Line of Credit   

The
Company has a revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank that allows for maximum borrowings of $2,000,000. The borrowings
are secured by certain collateralized accounts totaling $2,000,000. The facility bears interest at a rate of U.S. prime (3.50%
at September 30, 2016). Interest is payable monthly and the principal is due upon maturity on October 5, 2017. As of September
30, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and unused availability under this facility was $2,000,000.  

6.
 ACCRUED EXPENSES   

Accrued
expenses are comprised of the following:  

7.
 INCOME TAXES   

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL s) for federal and New York state income tax
purposes of approximately $47.4 million. In March 2016, the Company completed an Internal Revenue Code Section 382 study which
determined that a cumulative three-year ownership change in excess of 50% had occurred in March 2016 due to a share repurchase.
As a result, the Company s available NOLs were reduced from $47.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $2.2 million during the
first quarter of 2016. There can be no assurance that the Company will realize any benefit of the NOL s. The federal and
New York state NOL s are available to offset future taxable income and expire from 2016 through 2036 if not utilized. The
Company has a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets since management continues to believe that it is more likely
than not that these assets will not be realized.  

8.
 SHARE BASED COMPENSATION   

The
Company accounts for the issuance of equity awards to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and 505, which requires that
the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. These pronouncements establish
fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply
a fair value based measurement method in accounting for all share based payment transactions with employees.  

All
stock-based compensation is included in operating expenses for the periods as follows:  

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the options. The table below presents the weighted average expected
life of the options in years. The expected life computation is based on the time to option expiration. Volatility is determined
using changes in historical stock prices. The interest rate for periods within the expected life of the award is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  

The
fair value of share-based payment units was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions
and weighted average fair values as follows:  

Stock
option activity under the 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2006 and 2015 Stock Option Plans (collectively, the  Plans ) during
the periods indicated below were as follows:  

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s
closing stock price on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options)
that would have been received by the option holders had they all exercised their options on September 30, 2016. This amount changes
based upon the fair market value of the Company s stock.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had 921,831 shares available for future grants under the Plans.  

Restricted
Stock Units    

The
Company issues Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) which are equity-based instruments that may be settled in shares of
common stock of the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued RSUs to certain directors and
officers as compensation. RSU agreements can vest immediately or with the passage of time. The vesting of all RSUs is contingent
on continued board and employment services.  

The
compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock
on the date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and charged to general
and administrative expense with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there was $592,435 of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all
unvested stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately

Critical
Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates   

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company s
financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
statements include impairment of goodwill, valuation of intangible assets, deferred tax valuation allowances, allowance for doubtful
accounts and the fair value of stock options granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans. Due to the inherent
uncertainties involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates.  

We
believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as
these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and
estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and commitments
and contingencies. These policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below.  

Goodwill   

The
excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets of acquired businesses is considered goodwill. Under authoritative
guidance, purchased goodwill is not amortized, but rather it is periodically reviewed for impairment. We had goodwill of $8,101,661
at September 30, 2016. This goodwill resulted from the acquisition of Mobilisa, Inc. and Positive Access Corporation.  

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter. Under authoritative
guidance, we can use industry and Company specific qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment
exists, before using a two-step quantitative analysis. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review
include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity specific
events and sustained decrease in share price. As a result of the qualitative factors in 2015, specifically as a result of the
decline in the stock price and the decrease in market multiples, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test in
order to identify potential impairment by comparing our fair value of the Company to our carrying amount, including goodwill.
The fair value was determined using the weighting of certain valuation techniques, including both income and market approaches
which include a discounted cash flow analysis, an estimation of an implied control premium, in addition to our market capitalization
on the measurement date. The implied control premium selected was developed based on certain observable market data of comparable
companies. The market capitalization is sensitive to the volatility of our stock price. Although we believe that the factors considered
in the impairment analysis are reasonable, changes in any one of the assumptions used could have produced a different result which
may have led to an impairment charge. Any future impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our long-term assets
and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist.  

As
of December 31, 2015, we determined that the fair value was in excess of its carrying amount and therefore the second step of
the goodwill impairment test was not required.  

We
determined that no events occurred or circumstances changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amounts. We will, however, continue to monitor our stock price
and operations for any potential indicators of impairment. We will conduct the 2016 annual test for goodwill impairment in the
fourth quarter, or at such time where an indicator of impairment appears to exist.  

Intangible
Assets   

Our
intangible assets consist of trade names, patents, developed technology and non-contractual customer relationships and as a result
of a qualitative analysis, we do not believe there is any indication of impairment.  

Revenue
Recognition and Deferred Revenue   

Revenue
is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable,
collectability is probable, and there is no future Company involvement or commitment. We sell our commercial products directly
through its sales force and through distributors. Revenue from direct sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer
and title has passed.  

Under
the provisions of ASC Topic 605-25,  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,  for multi-element arrangements
that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software
elements relating to the tangible product s essential software, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative
selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to
deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling
price and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable
separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company s best estimates of what
the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.  

We
also recognize revenues from licensing of its patented software to customers. The licensed software requires continuing service
or post contractual customer support and performance; accordingly, a portion of the revenue is deferred based on its fair value
and recognized ratably over the period in which the future service, support and performance are provided, which is generally one
to three years. Royalties from the licensing of our technology are recognized as revenues in the period they are earned.  

We
also perform consulting work for other companies. These services are billed on a time and materials basis. Revenue from these
arrangements is also recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased.  

Subscriptions
to database information can be purchased for month-to-month, one, two, and three year periods. Revenue from subscriptions are
deferred and recognized over the contractual period, which is typically three years.  

We
offer enhanced extended warranties for our sales of hardware and software at a set price. The revenue from these sales are deferred
and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual period, which is typically one to four years.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

We
account for the issuance of equity awards to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and 505, which requires that the cost
resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This pronouncement establishes
fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply
a fair value based measurement method in accounting for all share based payment transactions with employees.  

Deferred
Income Taxes   

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carry forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using expected tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. We have recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of September
30, 2016, due to the uncertainty of the our ability to realize those assets.  

Commitments
and Contingencies   

We
are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.  

The
above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment
of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management s
judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result.  

Results
of Operations  (All figures have been rounded to the nearest $1,000)  

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues
for quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased 45% to $1,214,000 compared to $2,199,000 for the previous year.  

The
decrease in Identity Systems revenue in the third quarter of 2016 is primarily the result of lower commercial and Defense ID  
 sales. The decrease in other revenues is a result of our sale of the Wireless asset business in the third quarter of 2015.
Total invoiced orders decreased 43% to $1,169,000 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $2,036,000 in the third quarter of
2015. As of September 30, 2016, our backlog, which represents non-cancelable sales orders for products not yet shipped and services
to be performed, was approximately $233,000 compared to $898,000 at September 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our backlog was
approximately $339,000.  

Our
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 77.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 63.5% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in percentage is due to higher revenues on our Software as a Service ( SaaS )
model and lower equipment sales that typically has a lower margin.  

Operating
expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses, decreased $1,098,000 or
40% to $1,677,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,775,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs for stock-based compensation on stock options issued during the prior quarter
and amortization in prior period related to a fully amortized intangible asset. We also incurred a reduction in expenses such
as legal and professional fees as well as decreased the use of a specialized consulting firm for certain research and development
projects.  

Other
income and expense was insignificant for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Other income and expense of $112,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of the gain on the sale of the wireless assets on August 31, 2015.  

As
further explained in Note 7, we have a net operating loss carryforward for losses generated in prior years of $2.2 million and,
therefore, no provision for income tax has been made for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

As
a result of the factors noted above, the Company generated a net loss of $727,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to a net loss of $1,268,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues
decreased by 43% to $3,105,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,478,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  

The
decrease in Identity Systems revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily the result of lower commercial
and Defense ID    sales. The decrease in other revenues is the result of our sale of the Wireless asset business
in the third quarter of 2015.  

Our
gross profit as a percentage of revenues amounted to 79.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 55.3% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the percentage is due to higher revenues on our new SaaS model and lower
equipment sales that typically has a lower margin.  

Operating
expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses, increased $184,000 or 3%
to $7,141,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $6,957,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase is primarily due to a severance package expensed in the current year to a former officer pursuant to an employment agreement
to be paid through May 2017, accelerated R D efforts and an increase in legal fees. These increases are offset in part by
a reduction in headcount, amortization in 2015 related to a fully amortized intangible asset and a reduction in professional fees.  

Other
income and expense was insignificant for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other income and expense of $141,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of the gain on the sale of the wireless assets on August 31, 2015.  

As
further explained in Note 7, we have a net operating loss carryforward for losses generated in prior years of $2.2 million and,
therefore, no provision for income tax has been made for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

As
a result of the factors noted above, the Company generated a net loss of $4,646,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to a net loss of $3,784,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  (All figures have been rounded to the nearest $1,000)  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,534,000, working capital (defined as current assets minus current
liabilities) of $3,040,000, total assets of $15,538,000 and stockholders  equity of $13,557,000.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used net cash of $3,471,000 in operating activities as compared to net cash used
of $3,745,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in investing activities was $22,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $157,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was
$1,074,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7,601,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

On
February 24, 2016, we entered into a stock repurchase agreement with two former directors, who were also members of management
(the  Former Executives ) for the repurchase of all 979,114 shares owned by the Former Executives of our common stock
for $1,096,608. The transaction was finalized on March 4, 2016.  

On
June 15, 2016, we announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 1,200,000 shares of our common stock and 600,000
five year warrants to purchase shares with an exercise price of $2.20 per share, at a combined public offering of $1.75 per share
and half-warrant. Net proceeds to the Company from this offering were approximately $1,902,000 after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions paid by the Company. As part of the offering, there was an overallotment option for the underwriters to purchase
up to 180,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.63 per share and/or up to 90,000 additional warrants at a purchase
price of $0.0001 per warrant. On June 20, 2016, the underwriters exercised their right to purchase 23,320 warrants. Direct offering
costs totaling approximately $122,000 were recorded as a reduction to the net proceeds on the consolidated statement of stockholders 
equity.  

We
have a revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank that allows for maximum borrowings of $2,000,000. The borrowings are
secured by collateralized accounts totaling $2,000,000. The facility bears interest at a rate of U.S. prime (3.50 % at September
30, 2016). Interest is payable monthly and the principal is due upon maturity on October 5, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, there
were no amounts outstanding under this facility and unused availability under this facility was $2,000,000.  

We
currently anticipate that our available cash, expected cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit agreement,
will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.  

We
keep the option open to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies which may include the need to fund more rapid
expansion, fund additional marketing expenditures, develop new markets for our technology, enhance our operating infrastructure,
respond to competitive pressures, or acquire complementary businesses or necessary technologies. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to secure the additional funds when needed or obtain such on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  

We
have filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ),
which became effective July 19, 2010. Under the shelf registration statement, we may offer and sell, from time to time in the
future in one or more public offerings, our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and units. The aggregate initial offering
price of all securities sold by us will not exceed $25,000,000, and, pursuant to SEC rules, we may only sell up to one-third of
the market cap held by non-affiliate stockholders in any 12-month period. We renewed this registration with the SEC on October
21, 2016 and it was declared effective November 3, 2016.  

The
specific terms of any future offering, including the prices and use of proceeds, will be determined at the time of any such offering
and will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement which will be filed with the SEC at the time of the offering.  

The
shelf registration statement is designed to give the Company the flexibility to access additional capital at some point in the
future when market conditions are appropriate.  

We
are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding, or arbitration, the outcome of which is expected to have a material
adverse effect on our business.  

Net
Operating Loss Carry Forwards    

As
of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL s ) for federal and New York State income
tax purposes of approximately $47.4 million. In March 2016, we completed a study which determined that a cumulative three-year
ownership change in excess of 50% had occurred in March 2016 due to a share repurchase. As a result, our available NOLs were reduced
from $47.4 million to $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2016. There can be no assurance that we will realize any benefit
of the NOL s. The federal and New York state NOL s are available to offset future taxable income and expire from 2016
to 2036, if not utilized.  

Adjusted
EBITDA   

We
use Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net loss,
interest, income taxes, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation
expense. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management
believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial results with other companies
that also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as impairments of long-lived
assets and goodwill, amortization, depreciation and stock-based compensation, as well as non-operating charges for interest and
income taxes, investors can evaluate our operations and can compare the results on a more consistent basis to the results of other
companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures management uses to monitor and evaluate financial and operating
results.  

We
consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a useful
measure of our historical operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it
excludes interest and other income and expense, impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation expense,
all of which impact our profitability, as well as depreciation and amortization related to the use of long-term assets which benefit
multiple periods. We believe that these limitations are compensated by providing Adjusted EBITDA only with GAAP net loss and clearly
identifying the difference between the two measures. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for net loss presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by us may not be comparable with similarly
named measures provided by other entities.  

A
reconciliation of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA follows:  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities. We have
not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets.  

Forward
Looking Statements

 estimates,   expects,   projects,   intends,   plans,   believes 
and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and beliefs
about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances,
and the Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements
whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated, with the participation of our management, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September
30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), were effective.  

Our
disclosure controls and procedures have been formulated to ensure (i) that information that we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) that the information required to be disclosed
by us is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the second quarter of 2016 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Item
1A. Risk Factors  

Current
economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial
performance.  

While
a significant portion of our business is with the U.S. government, our operating results may be impacted by the overall health
of the North American economy. Our business and financial performance, including collection of our accounts receivable, realization
of inventory, recoverability of assets including investments, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions,
such as a reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility, recession, etc.

a)  
      designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,

b)  
      designed

      any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
