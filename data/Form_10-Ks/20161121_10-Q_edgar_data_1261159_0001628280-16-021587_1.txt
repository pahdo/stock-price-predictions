1.  
    Organization and Nature of Business: 
     CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. (the  Company ), was organized in Maryland on August 11, 2003. The Company believes it has operated and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a  REIT ) for federal income tax. In November 2016, the Company determined it needed to accrue a provision for income tax in connection with retaining its REIT status, as described further in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies." The Company generally invests in lifestyle properties in the United States that are primarily leased on a long-term (generally   five   to   20   years, plus multiple renewal options), triple-net or gross basis to tenants or operators that the Company considers to be industry leading. In the event of certain tenant defaults, the Company has engaged third-party managers to operate properties on its behalf until they are re-leased. The Company has engaged CNL Lifestyle Advisor Corporation (the  Advisor ) as its advisor to provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and administrative services. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   43   lifestyle properties directly within the following asset classes: ski and mountain lifestyle and attractions.   Seven   of these properties were held for sale and   three   are located in Canada. 
  In March 2014, the Company engaged Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies ), a leading global investment banking and advisory firm, to assist the Company s management and its board of directors in actively evaluating various strategic alternatives to provide liquidity to the Company s shareholders. In connection with this process, during 2014 and 2015, the Company sold   104   properties and an interest in   one   unconsolidated joint venture, which included its entire golf portfolio (consisting of   48   properties), its multi-family development property, its   81.98%   interest in the DMC Partnership to its co-venture partner, its senior housing portfolio (consisting of   38   properties),   12   of its   17   marinas properties,   four   attractions properties and   one   ski and mountain lifestyle property. The Company used the net sales proceeds from the sale of these properties to repay indebtedness during 2014 and 2015 and also provided stockholders with partial liquidity when it made a special distribution to stockholders during December 2015. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2016, the Company (i) sold its remaining   five   marina properties and its unimproved land for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately   $50.4 million  , (ii) acquired the remaining   20%   interest in the Intrawest Venture from its co-venture partner, and (iii) as of   September 30, 2016   had contracts in place to sell   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties which were classified as held for sale.  

2.  
    Significant Accounting Policies  : 
     Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management are necessary for the fair statement of the Company s results for the interim period presented. Operating results for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . Amounts as of   December 31, 2015   included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from audited consolidated financial statements as of that date but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts, the accounts of wholly owned subsidiaries or subsidiaries for which the Company has a controlling interest, the accounts of variable interest entities ( VIEs ) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, and the accounts of other subsidiaries over which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  In accordance with the guidance for the consolidation of VIEs, the Company analyzes its variable interests, including loans, leases, guarantees, and equity investments, to determine if the entity in which it has a variable interest is a VIE. The Company s analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. The Company bases its quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity and its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. The Company also uses its quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and if such determination is made, it includes the accounts of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements.

2.  
    Significant Accounting Policies     (Continued)  : 
       
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. For example, significant estimates and assumptions are made in connection with the allocation of purchase price and the analysis of real estate, equity method investments and impairments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications     Certain amounts in the prior year s condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation with no effect on previously reported net loss or equity. See "Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" below and Note 4.  Assets Held for Sale, net and Discontinued Operations  for additional information. 
  Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statement         The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and related regulations beginning with the year ended December 31, 2004. As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to federal corporate income taxes provided it distributes at least 100% of its REIT taxable income and capital gains and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Subject to compliance with applicable tax law, certain properties may be operated using an eligible third-party manager. In those cases, taxable income from those operations may be subject to federal income tax.  
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that   five   tenants from whom it received leasehold income may be viewed for federal income tax purposes as the same party who also serves as an eligible third-party manager, also known as an  independent contractor  (within the meaning of section 856(d)(3) of the Code) on behalf of the Company with respect to   two   properties for which the Company previously made an election pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations to treat such properties as  foreclosure property.  If, because of the relationship between the tenant entities and the independent contractor entities, the Company is viewed as deriving or receiving income from the independent contractor, it could affect the Company's compliance with the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs.  The  foreclosure property  elections would have terminated and, as of the first day following such terminations, the gross income the Company derived from such properties would not be qualifying income under the gross income tests that are applicable to REITs.  In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company annually must satisfy certain tests regarding the source of its gross income. The applicable federal income tax rules provide a  savings clause  for REITs that fail to satisfy the REIT gross income tests if such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and the REIT complies with certain disclosure and filing requirements. A REIT that qualifies for the savings clause will retain its REIT status but may be required to pay a tax under section 857(b)(5) of the Code and related interest.  
  As a result of not being able to satisfy the gross income test described above throughout 2015, the Company's previously issued financial statements did not appropriately reflect tax expense associated with unqualified gross income in the periods in which such income was earned.  The impact of this misstatement was approximately   $0.7 million   for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an additional   $8.4 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and an additional   $0.7 million   for the three months ended December 31, 2015. There was   no   impact to the three months ended March 31, 2015 related to this misstatement due to the timing of the period in which the income was earned.  Additionally, the Company has self-insured retention amounts for certain properties.  Accordingly, under GAAP, the Company should establish a liability for both known claims and claims that are incurred but not reported ("IBNR").  The Company determined that the methodology utilized to establish its IBNR did not appropriately consider all costs to settle its claims related to IBNR claims.  The impact of this misstatement was approximately   $0.7 million   for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and approximately   $0.3 million   for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015.   
  Management evaluated the impact of the above misstatements on all previously issued financial statements and concluded that the previously issued financial statements were not materially misstated.  However, the impact of recording the misstatements in the current period would be material to the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the estimated results for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Accordingly, the Company has revised its condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, for the interim periods of 2015 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015, and for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   presented in this Report on Form 10-Q. 
  The following changes have been made to the Company's previously issued consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income (in thousands, except per share amounts).  No changes were made to the consolidated statement of cash flows.

    Significant Accounting Policies     (Continued)  : 

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements         In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which requires amendments to both the VIE and voting models. The amendments (i) modify the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), the VIE characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and primary beneficiary determination under the VIE model, and (ii) eliminate the presumption within the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The amendments may be applied using either a modified retrospective or full retrospective approach. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not result in any changes to conclusions about whether the Company s   three   wholly-owned entities with purchase options were VIEs or whether the Company was the primary beneficiary of these entities. Additionally, it did not result in any changes to conclusions in relation to its investment in the Intrawest Venture, its unconsolidated joint venture.  In April 2016, the Company acquired the remaining   20%   interest in the Intrawest Venture from its co-venture partner.  The Company's acquisition of the   20%   interest was deemed a reconsideration event and the Company determined that this now wholly-owned entity was no longer a VIE.  Refer to Note 6, "Unconsolidated Entities" for additional information. 
  During 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  and also issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016, which impacted the Company s presentation of loan costs related to its borrowings and line of credit arrangement on its consolidated financial position but did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows. As permitted by ASU 2015-03, the Company has retrospectively adjusted the presentation of loan costs related to its mortgage and notes payables and presented these loan costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt payable for all periods presented. As permitted by ASU 2015-15, the Company did not change the presentation of loan costs related to its line of credit arrangement and continued to present these loan costs as Other Assets on the statement of financial position.  
  The following table provides additional details by financial statement line item of the adjusted presentation in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

    Significant Accounting Policies     (Continued)  : 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  as a new ASC topic (Topic 606). The core principle of this amendment is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard further provides guidance for any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, lease contracts). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of Effective Date  which defers the original effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU 2014-09 can be adopted using one of two retrospective application methods: 1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or 2) as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has determined that it will not early adopt ASU 2014-09 and is still evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842): Accounting for Leases,  which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The ASU requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU further modifies lessors  classification criteria for leases and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The ASU will also require qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users additional information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. However its adoption is expected to have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

    Real Estate Investment Properties, net     (continued)  : 
     The Company evaluates its properties on an ongoing basis, including any changes to intended use of the properties, operating performance of its properties or plans to dispose of assets to determine if the carrying value is recoverable.  As described above in Note 1.  Organization and Nature of Business,  management and its board of directors have been actively evaluating various strategic alternatives to provide liquidity to the Company s stockholders.  On November 2, 2016, as further described below in Note 12. "Subsequent Events," the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its remaining   36   properties.  The Company determined that the book value of certain of its ski and mountain lifestyle properties exceeded the estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell and as a result recorded an impairment provision of approximately   $8.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Assets Held for Sale, net and Discontinued Operations: 
     Assets Held for Sale, net     The Company had classified   seven   and   six   properties as assets held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The following table presents the net carrying value of the properties classified as held for sale (in thousands): 

Associated Liabilities Held for Sale     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had below market lease intangibles of approximately   $7.4 million   associated with the assets of its   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties held for sale.  There were   no   associated liabilities held for sale as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had   six   properties classified as held for sale.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold its remaining   five   marina properties and its unimproved land. The Company received aggregate sales proceeds net of closing costs for the sale of these properties of approximately   $50.4 million  , which resulted in aggregate gains of approximately   $10.6 million   for financial reporting purposes, of which approximately   $0.9 million   and   $9.7 million   was recorded in continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.   No   disposition fee was payable to the Advisor on the sale of the   five   marina properties or the unimproved land.  
  On April 1, 2016, as described in Note 6, "Unconsolidated Entities," the Company acquired the remaining   20%   interest in the Intrawest Venture, from its co-venture partner and held a combined   100%   controlling  interest in the Intrawest Venture entities that owned   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties.  In addition, upon acquisition the Company agreed to sell these   seven   properties and as of   September 30, 2016  , had   seven   properties classified as held for sale. 
  The Company accounted for the revenues and expenses related to   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties classified as held for sale (effective April 2016, when they became wholly-owned), and   one   undeveloped land sold during 2016 as income from continuing operations because the sale of these properties did not cause a strategic shift in the Company nor were the sales considered to have a major impact on the Company s business. Accordingly, they did not qualify as discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2015.  
    
  Discontinued Operations     The Company classified the revenues and expenses related to the   38   senior housing and   17   marina properties, originally identified as held for sale in 2014, as discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

6.  
    Unconsolidated Entities: 
     As of December 31, 2015, the Company held an   80%   ownership interest in the Intrawest Venture with a carrying value of approximately   $73.4 million  .  The Company had classified its investment in the Intrawest Venture, an unconsolidated entity, as a VIE and concluded it was not the primary beneficiary.  As part of the Company's evaluation of strategic alternatives to provide stockholders with liquidity of their investment, as described further in Note 1, "Organization and Nature of Business," the Company initiated the buy-sell process permitted under the partnership agreement of the Intrawest Venture.  In July 2015, the co-venture partner of the Intrawest Venture accepted the Company s offer to acquire the co-venture partner s   20%   non-controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture in accordance with the buy-sell provisions of the Intrawest Venture partnership agreement, subject to satisfaction of certain terms and conditions.  Effective April 1, 2016, the Company satisfied the terms and conditions under the buy-sell provisions of the partnership agreement and acquired its co-venture partner's   20%   interest in the Intrawest Venture for a nominal amount.  In conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining   20%   interest, in April 2016, the Company contributed   $5.8 million   to the Intrawest Venture and the Intrawest Venture used the proceeds and repaid a mezzanine loan from its joint venture partner and related accrued interest of   $5.8 million  .  
  The acquisition of the co-venture partner s   20%   non-controlling interest, which resulted in the Company owning a combined   100%   controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture, was deemed a VIE reconsideration event and the Company determined that the Intrawest Venture was no longer a VIE.  As a result of the Company s   100%   controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture, which owned   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties, the Company began consolidating all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements effective April 1, 2016.  In addition, as part of the Company's evaluation of strategic alternatives, upon acquiring the   20%   interest, the Company agreed to sell the   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties, classified them as held for sale and the entities that owned these properties ceased recording depreciation on these   seven   properties.  In May and June 2016, the Company entered into purchase and sale agreements for the sale of the   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties owned by the Intrawest Venture.  The expected sales proceeds, net of expected closing costs, approximated the carrying value of the properties.  See Note 12, "Subsequent Events" for additional information. 
  On April 1, 2016, the nominal consideration paid to acquire the remaining   20%   interest, along with the approximate   $79.5 million   carrying value of the Company s investment in the unconsolidated entity, was less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, which resulted in a gain of approximately   $30.0 million   in connection with this transaction.  The Company determined the fair values of the real estate based on anticipated sales proceeds from the anticipated sale of the   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties, less costs to sell.  The Company determined that the fair value of cash, trade receivables and trade payable ( Working Capital, net ) approximated their carrying values. 
  The following summarizes the allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of April 1, 2016 (in thousands): 

FOOTNOTES: 
           (1) 
    Intangibles were comprised of approximately   $13.7 million  ,   $3.1 million   and   $(7.4) million   of in-place lease, above-market lease and below-market lease intangible assets (liabilities), respectively. 
     The following summarizes the gain that resulted from the change of control in the unconsolidated equity method investment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

7.  
    Indebtedness  : 
     Line of Credit         In August 2016, the Company terminated its   $100.0 million   revolving line of credit.   
  Mortgages and Other Notes Payable         During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold its remaining   five   marinas properties and used a portion of the net sales proceeds to repay approximately   $10.5 million   of outstanding indebtedness collateralized by   three   of the marina properties.  In addition, the Company repaid outstanding indebtedness of approximately   $18.2 million   collaterialized by   one   attractions property which was scheduled to mature in September 2016 and   $8.8 million   in scheduled principal payments under its mortgage loans. 
  The estimated fair market value and carrying value of the Company s mortgages and other notes payable were approximately $  148.3 million   and $  148.3 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . The estimated fair market value of the Company s debt was determined based on rates and spreads the Company would expect to obtain for similar borrowings with similar loan terms. Because this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values related to the Company s mortgage notes payable is categorized as Level 3 on the three-level valuation hierarchy. The estimated fair value of accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates the carrying value as of   September 30, 2016   because of the relatively short maturities of the obligations. 

8.  
    Fair Value Measurements: 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s   one   hedge qualified as highly effective and, accordingly, all of the change in value is reflected in other comprehensive income (loss). Determining fair value and testing effectiveness of these financial instruments requires management to make certain estimates and judgments. Changes in assumptions could have a positive or negative impact on the estimated fair values and measured effectiveness of such instruments could, in turn, impact the Company s results of operations. 
    
  The Company s derivative instrument is valued primarily based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities (such as interest rates, volatilities, and credit risks) and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the derivative instrument also includes a credit value adjustment which is a Level 3 input. However, the impact of the assumption is not significant to its overall valuation calculation, and therefore the Company considers its derivative instrument to be classified as Level 2. The fair value of the derivative instrument is included in other liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company had   seven   properties classified as assets held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , which were carried at fair value, based on estimated sales price, less costs to sell.  The Company had   14   real estate investment properties that were carried at fair value as of   December 31, 2015  , as a result of writing down the book values of these properties to their estimated fair values based on estimated discounted cash flows and residual values during 2015. The Company had   six   additional properties that were classified as assets held for sale that were carried at fair value at   December 31, 2015  , based on estimated sales price less costs to sell. The Level 3 unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of the real estate properties include, but are not limited to, appraisal information from an independent appraisal firm affiliated with the independent investment banking firm engaged as our valuation advisor, comparable sales transactions and other information from brokers and potential buyers, as applicable. 
  The following tables show the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as follows (in thousands):

    Commitments and Contingencies  : 
     From time to time, the Company may be a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of, or incidental to the normal course of, its business, including proceedings to enforce its contractual or statutory rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe the final outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. 

In October 2016, the Company sold the   seven   ski and mountain lifestyle properties that were classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .  The net sales proceeds, after the payment of closing costs, for these properties was approximately   $98.0 million  , which approximated the net carrying value of the properties.    No   disposition fee was payable to the Advisor on the sale of these   seven   properties.  
  On November 2, 2016, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its remaining   36   properties (the "Sale Agreement") for approximately   $830.0 million  , as previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed on   November 2, 2016  .  In connection with the transaction contemplated by the Sale Agreement, on November 1, 2016, the Company's board approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution (the "Plan of Dissolution").  The Sale Agreement and the Plan of Dissolution will be subject to approval by the Company's stockholders to be held in accordance with the Company's bylaws upon approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a joint prospectus proxy statement relating thereto. The board also declared a special cash distribution of   $162.6 million  , or   $0.50   per share. In addition, in light of the Plan of Dissolution, the Board also approved the suspension of the Company's quarterly cash distribution on its common stock effective as of the fourth quarter distribution.

GENERAL 
  CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. is a Maryland corporation incorporated on August 11, 2003. We were formed primarily to acquire lifestyle properties in the United States that we generally lease on a long-term, triple-net basis (generally   five   to   20   years, plus multiple renewal options) to tenants or operators that we consider to be industry leading. We defined lifestyle properties as those properties that reflect or are impacted by the social, consumption and entertainment values and choices of our society. When beneficial to our investment structure and as a result of tenant defaults, we engaged third-party managers to operate certain properties on our behalf as permitted under applicable tax regulations. We engaged CNL Lifestyle Advisor Corporation (the  Advisor ) as our Advisor to provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and administrative services. 
  Our principal business objectives included investing in and owning a diversified portfolio of real estate with a goal to preserve, protect and enhance the long-term value of those assets. We built a portfolio of properties that we considered to be well-diversified by region, asset type and operator. In March 2014, we engaged Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies ), a leading global investment banking and advisory firm, to assist management and the board of directors in actively evaluating various strategic opportunities including the sale of either us or our assets, potential merger opportunities, or the listing of our common stock. See  Our Exit Strategy  below for additional information. 
  We currently operate and have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level to the extent that we distribute at least 100% of our REIT taxable income and capital gains to our stockholders and meet other compliance requirements. We are subject to income taxes on taxable income from certain properties operated by third-party managers. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is lost. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. We are organized and believed we had operated in a manner to qualify for treatment as a REIT beginning with the year ended December 31, 2004. In November 2016, we determined that we needed to accrue a provision for income tax in connection with retaining our REIT status, as described further below in "Liquidity and Capital Resources   Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources." We intend to continue to be organized and to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
  Our Exit Strategy 
  We began a process of evaluating strategic alternatives in an effort to provide stockholders with liquidity of their investment, either in whole or in part, including, without limitation, through (i) the commencement of an orderly sale of our assets, outside of the ordinary course of business and consistent with our objectives of qualifying as a REIT, and the distribution of the net sales proceeds thereof to the stockholders, (ii) our merger with or into another entity in a transaction which provides the stockholders with cash or securities of a publicly traded company or (iii) a listing of our shares on a national stock exchange ( Listing ). As part of this process, we will seek to maximize the total value of our portfolio in connection with our evaluation of various strategic opportunities in preparation for an exit strategy. 
  In connection with these objectives, in March 2014, we engaged Jefferies and formed a special committee comprised solely of our independent directors to assist management and the Board of Directors in actively evaluating various strategic opportunities including the sale of either us or our assets, potential merger opportunities, or the Listing of our common stock. In connection with this process, between 2014 and 2015, we sold   104   properties, which consisted of our entire golf portfolio (consisting of   48   properties), our multi-family development property, our entire senior housing portfolio (consisting of   38   properties),   12   marina properties,   four   attractions properties and   one   ski and mountain lifestyle property, for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately $1.377 billion. During 2015 we also sold our 81.98% interest in the DMC Partnership, an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated the Dallas Market Center (the  DMC Partnership ), for net sales proceeds of approximately $139.5 million to our co-venture partner. We used the net sales proceeds from the sale of these properties to repay indebtedness during 2014 and 2015. In accordance with our undertaking to provide stockholders with partial liquidity, we also used a portion of net sales proceeds received from the sale of properties during the year ended December 31, 2015 to make a special distribution to stockholders of approximately $422.7 million during December 2015.

During   2016   and through   November 18, 2016  , we had completed the sale of our remaining five marina properties and our unimproved land for more than their carrying value.  Additionally, in April 2016 we acquired our co-venture partner s 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture and subsequently in October 2016, we sold the seven ski and mountain lifestyle properties, which were owned through the Intrawest Venture, at their net carrying value. 
  As of   November 18, 2016  , we had a portfolio of   36   lifestyle properties. When aggregated by initial purchase price, the portfolio was diversified as follows: approximately 58% in ski and mountain lifestyle and 42% in attractions properties. 
  On November 2, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our remaining   36   properties (the "Sale Agreement") for approximately   $830.0 million  , as previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed on   November 2, 2016  .  In connection with the transaction contemplated by the Sale Agreement, on November 1, 2016 our board approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution (the "Plan of Dissolution"). The Sale Agreement and the Plan of Dissolution will be subject to the approval by our stockholders to be held in accordance with our bylaws upon approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a joint prospectus proxy statement relating thereto. The board also declared a special cash distribution of   $162.6 million  , or   $0.50   per share.  In addition, in light of the Plan of Dissolution, our Board also approved the suspension of our quarterly cash distribution on our common stock effective as of the fourth quarter distribution.

  The majority of the properties in our real estate portfolio are operated by third-party tenant operators under long-term triple-net leases for which we report rental income and are not directly exposed to the variability of property-level operating revenues and expenses. We also engage third-party managers to operate certain properties on our behalf for which we record the property-level operating revenues and expenses and are directly exposed to the variability of the property s operations which impacts our results of operations. We believe that the financial and operational performance of our tenants and managers, and the general conditions of the industries within which they operate, provide indicators about our tenants  health and their ability to pay contractually obligated rent. For example, positive growth in visitation and per capita spending may result in our receipt of additional percentage rent and, conversely, declines may impact our tenants  ability to pay rent to us. 
  The following table illustrates property level revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) reported to us by our tenants and managers for the asset types below and includes both our leased and managed properties. We have only included property-level operating performance for consolidated properties (for all periods presented) in the table below. Property-level operating performance from our unconsolidated properties has been excluded because we do not believe it is as relevant and meaningful particularly since we are entitled to receive cash distribution preferences where we receive a stated return on our investment each year ahead of our partners. Our tenants and managers are contractually required to provide this information to us in accordance with their respective lease and management agreements. While this information has not been audited, it has been reviewed by management to determine whether the information is reasonable and accurate in all material respects. In connection with this review, management reviews monthly property level operating performance versus budgeted expectations, conducts periodic operational review calls with operators and conducts periodic property inspections. We monitor the credit of our tenants by reviewing their rental payment history, timeliness of rent collections, their operational performance on our properties and by monitoring news and industry reports regarding our tenants and their underlying businesses. We have aggregated this performance data on a  same-store  basis only for comparable properties that we have owned during the entirety of all periods presented. We have not included performance data on acquisitions or dispositions made from January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016   because we did not own those properties during the entirety of all periods presented below. For these reasons, we consider the property level data to be performance information that gives us information on trends which does not directly represent our results of operations. We do not consider this information to be a non-GAAP measure which can be reconciled to our GAAP financial statements because it includes the performance of properties that are leased to third-party tenants. However, we believe this information is useful to help readers of our financial statements understand and evaluate trends, events and uncertainties in our business as it relates to our prior periods and to broader industry performance (in thousands):

    Property operating results for tenants under leased arrangements are not included in the company s operating results. Property-level EBITDA above is disclosed before rent and capital reserve payments to us, as applicable. 
     Overall, for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   our tenants and managers reported to us a decrease in property-level revenue and EBITDA of   5.33%   and   21.92%  , respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in property-level revenues for our attractions properties was primarily caused by several parks in Texas and Washington where unseasonable rain and cool temperatures resulted in lower daily visitation. The decrease in property-level EBITDA was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues and increases in labor expenses and repairs and maintenance expenses. 
  Overall, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our tenants and managers reported to us an increase in property-level revenue and EBITDA of   8.69%   and   11.47%  , respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in property-level revenue was primarily attributable to our ski and mountain lifestyle properties. Results of the 2015/16 winter season through   September 30, 2016   reflect varying performance between our Western and Northeastern ski resorts, with further distinction between northern and southern resorts within those larger geographic areas. In the West, our resorts in Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia performed exceptionally well due to a generally strong start to the season, coupled with numerous well-timed snowstorms throughout the winter, bringing ample snowfall to ski areas in those regions. In the Pacific Northwest, one of our resorts set an all-time skier visit record, while another one of our resorts set an all-time revenue mark. At the opposite end in Southern California, one of our properties did not see the above-average snowfall typical of the El Ni o weather pattern forecasted for this year, and was forced to close in late February despite having an improved season-to-date compared to the prior two winters. Resorts in the Tahoe region of Northern California once again saw a more normalized snowfall pattern and performed well throughout the season.  Our resorts in the Rocky Mountain region had robust performance from start to finish, with one of our resorts benefiting from additional visitation by destination guests to Utah s Wasatch Mountains. In the Northeast, warmer temperatures, considerable rain and significantly less snowfall than average, constrained skier visits throughout New England, particularly at those resorts in southern Vermont, southern New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. The remaining three resorts located in northern New Hampshire and Maine fared better once colder temperatures arrived in January and snowmaking efforts commenced in earnest, drawing skier visits from other resorts in the more southerly parts of New England which were not able to provide a consistent on-snow experience.  
  As for our attractions properties, most of our attractions properties concluded their peak operations.  Some parks offer holiday events through the fall and winter, but generally, our operations are mostly complete for the waterparks by the close of the third quarter. Through September 30, 2016, the parks continued a softened revenue trend that lingered through the close of September with revenues down 5% to the prior year.  Revenue decreases were primarily caused by several parks in Texas and Washington where unseasonable rain and cool temperatures resulted in lower daily visitation. The decrease to prior year in property-level EBITDA is caused mainly by the decrease in revenues and minimum wage increases.  
  Seasonality 
  Many of the asset classes in which we invest experience seasonal fluctuations due to the nature of their business, geographic location, climate and weather patterns. As a result, these businesses experience seasonal variations in revenues that may require our operators to supplement operating cash from their properties in order to be able to make scheduled rent payments to us. We have structured the leases for certain tenants such that rents are paid on a seasonal schedule with most, if not all, of the rent being paid during the tenant s seasonally busy operating period. 
  As part of our portfolio diversification strategy, we have specifically considered the varying and complimentary seasonality of our asset classes and portfolio mix. For example, the peak operating season for our ski and mountain lifestyle assets is highly complementary to the peak seasons for our attractions assets to balance and mitigate the risks associated with seasonality. Generally, seasonality does not significantly affect our recognition of rental income from operating leases due to straight-line revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP. However, seasonality may impact the timing of when base rent payments are made by our tenants, which impacts our operating cash flows. Additionally, seasonality affects the amount of rental revenue we recognize in connection with capital improvement reserve revenue and percentage rents paid by our tenants, which is recognized in the period in which it is earned and is generally based on a percentage of tenant revenues. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

Seasonality also directly impacts certain of our properties where we engage independent third-party operators to manage on our behalf and where we record property operating revenues and expenses rather than straight-line rents from operating leases. These properties will likely generate net operating losses during their non-peak months while generating most, if not all, of their operating income during their peak operating months. Our consolidated operating results and cash flows during the first, second and fourth quarters will be lower than the third quarter primarily due to the non-peak operating months of our larger attractions properties. 
  Tenant Workouts, Bad Debt Expense and Loan Provisions 
  As described above under "Our Exit Strategy," on November 2, 2016 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our remaining   36   properties and in connection therewith we determined that the carrying value of certain properties exceeded the estimated sales price less costs to sell.  As a result, at   September 30, 2016  , we recorded approximately   $8.1 million   of impairment provisions to write down the book values of certain properties to estimated fair values based on estimated sales price from a third party buyer less costs to sell.   
  During 2015, we restructured the leases with one tenant relating to three attractions properties and reduced 2016 rents due, including percentage rent, by approximately $1.0 million.  Also during 2015, one of our ski tenants with two leases on properties in the Pacific-Northwest continued to experience financial difficulties, and was unable to pay rent due to lower operating results from the continued low levels of snow accompanied by unusually warm weather during the 2014/2015 ski season. As a result, during the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we reserved their outstanding rent related receivables and recorded bad debt expense of approximately   $3.3 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively, due to uncertainty of collectability. Snowfall levels improved in the fourth quarter of 2015, and this tenant has paid rental amounts related to the 2015/2016 ski season that started in the fall of 2015. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the borrower relating to one mortgage receivable continued to experience financial difficulties.  Additionally, we entered into an agreement to receive an early repayment of one of our other mortgage receivables.  We recorded the mortgage receivables at their net realizable values at   September 30, 2015   and in conjunction therewith, recorded loan loss provisions of   $21 thousand   and   $9.4 million  , respectively, during the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Subsequently in 2015, we received early repayment for both of our mortgage receivables at their discounted amounts. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  General 
  Our principal demand for funds are for operating expenses, debt service and cash distributions to stockholders. Generally, our cash needs will be covered by cash generated from our investments including rental income and property operating income from managed properties. To the extent we dispose of assets, we plan to use the net sales proceeds to retire indebtedness, make special distributions to our stockholders, enhance existing assets or for other corporate purposes. 
  We believe that our current liquidity needs for operating expenses, debt service and cash distributions to stockholders will be adequately covered by cash generated from our investments and other sources of available cash which may include asset sales proceeds. Additionally, as previously discussed, many of our asset classes experience seasonal fluctuations where they make rental payments to us during their peak operating months. As a result, our operating cash flows will fluctuate due to the seasonality of those properties. We believe that we will be able to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due in the ordinary course of business. 
  Cash Flows.   Our primary sources of cash include rental income from operating leases, property operating revenues, proceeds from sales of properties, and through April 2016, distributions from our unconsolidated entities, offset by payments made for operating expenses, including property operating expenses, asset management fees to our Advisor, debt service payments (principal and interest), and capital expenditures related to our real estate investments. The following is a summary of our cash flows (in thousands): 
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating Activities  .   Net cash provided from operating activities increased approximately $  14.1 million   or   17.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The improvement in cash from operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to same period in   2015   is primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense due to repayments of indebtedness and a decrease in asset management fees, partially offset by a reduction in operating income, due to the sale of   22   properties subsequent to September 30, 2015  
  Proceeds from Sales of Real Estate and an Unconsolidated Entity.     As described above in  Our Exit Strategy , we engaged Jefferies to assist management and our board of directors in actively evaluating various strategic opportunities including the sale of our assets. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately   $50.5 million   primarily from the sale of the remaining five marina properties and our unimproved land.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately   $757.9 million   from the sale of 38 senior housing properties and one attractions property. We also received net sales proceeds of approximately   $139.5 million   from the sale of our 81.98% interest in the DMC Partnership, an unconsolidated entity. We used the net sales proceeds from these sales to pay down indebtedness, as further described below under  Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources - Indebtedness.  
  Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities.   We were entitled to receive quarterly cash distributions from our unconsolidated entities to the extent there was cash available to distribute. In April 2015, we sold our 81.98% interest in the DMC Partnership to our co-venture partner, as described above. On April 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% non-controlling interest from our co-venture partner of the Intrawest Venture, in accordance with the buy-sell provisions of the Intrawest Venture partnership agreement.  As a result of owning a combined 100% controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture, we began consolidating all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Intrawest Venture. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received distributions of approximately   $1.1 million   from the Intrawest Venture, as compared to approximately   $11.7 million   from the Intrawest and DMC Partnership for the same period of 2015. We did not own any investments in unconsolidated entities effective April 2016 and will no longer receive distributions from unconsolidated entities in the future. 
  Cash Assumed through Purchase of Controlling Interest of Investment in Unconsolidated Entity.   As described above in "General - Our Exit Strategy," in April 2016 we purchased our co-venture partner s 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture for a nominal amount. As part of the acquisition, we assumed approximately   $11.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents. 
  Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Provision for Income Tax.   During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that five tenants from whom we receive leasehold income may be viewed for federal income tax purposes as the same party who also serves as an eligible third-party manager, also known as an  independent contractor  (within the meaning of section 856(d)(3) of the Code) on our behalf with respect to two properties for which we previously made an election pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations to treat such properties as  foreclosure property.    If, because of the relationship between the tenant entities and the independent contractor entities, we are viewed as deriving or receiving income from the independent contractor, that could affect our compliance with the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs.  The  foreclosure property  elections would have terminated and, as of the first day following such terminations, the gross income we derive from such properties would not be qualifying income under the gross income tests that are applicable to REITs.  In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, we annually must satisfy certain tests regarding the source of our gross income. The applicable federal income tax rules provide a  savings clause  for REITs that fail to satisfy the REIT gross income tests if such failure is "due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect" and the REIT complies with certain disclosure and filing requirements.  In general, a failure is considered due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if the REIT exercised ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to satisfy the gross income requirements.  Such care and prudence must be exercised both at the time each transaction is entered into by the REIT and at any later time when the REIT  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

determines that any prior transaction may result in the receipt of nonqualified income which reasonably can be expected to result in a violation of the gross income requirements. A REIT that qualifies for the savings clause will retain its REIT status but may be required to pay a tax under section 857(b)(5) of the Code and related interest.  We intend to pursue the available relief under such savings clause and believe we satisfy the requirement that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.  Nonetheless, we intend to seek confirmation from the applicable district director at the IRS that any such failure to satisfy the gross income tests was due to reasonable cause, though we can give no assurances that the IRS will provide such confirmation as applied to this particular set of facts and circumstances. In the event that the IRS determines that the relief under the  savings clause  described above does not apply, we could be treated as having failed to qualify as a REIT for one or more taxable years. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT for any taxable year, our income will be taxed at regular corporate rates resulting in higher taxes for the Company for years 2014, 2015 and 2016, and we could be prevented from re-electing REIT status until 2019.  In the event that the IRS were to determine that we were not eligible for such relief, there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.   
  As a result of not being able to satisfy the gross income test described above, at September 30, 2016, we accrued an income tax liability of approximately $12.8 million plus approximately $0.2 million in related interest, to reflect our belief that we qualify for the  savings clause  discussed above.  The amount accrued represents the estimated liability and interest, which remains subject to final resolution and therefore is subject to change.  One of the above reference properties was sold in 2015 and we intend to re-structure the ownership and/or operations of the other property prior to December 31, 2016, but in no event later than the month prior to material non-qualifying revenue being received, in such a manner as to allow the Company to satisfy the REIT gross income tests during 2017.  Accordingly, we will continue to accrue interest on the income taxes, for which accrual will continue in 2017, and intend to pay the tax provision plus accrued interest by or in March 2017.  Other than the interest, assuming that the IRS determines that the Company qualified for relief under the "savings clause," we do not expect to incur tax expense associated with a failure of the REIT gross income tests in future periods commencing January 1, 2017.   
  Indebtedness.   Subject to our goal of providing liquidity to our shareholders, we have and may borrow money to fund ongoing enhancements to our portfolio, pay certain related fees and, prior to the suspension of our distribution policy on November 1, 2016, to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities to avoid distribution volatility. See  Distributions  below for additional information. In many cases, we have pledged our assets in connection with such borrowings. As part of our Exit Strategy, as described above in "General - Our Exit Strategy," during 2014 and 2015 we sold approximately   104   properties for aggregate net sales proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion and repaid approximately $1.2 billion of indebtedness.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repaid   $10.5 million   relating to the outstanding indebtedness collateralized by three of the marina properties that were sold,   $18.2 million   in early repayment of indebtedness related to one attractions property scheduled to mature in September 2016 and   $8.8 million   in scheduled principal payments under our mortgage loans. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we paid $10.9 million in scheduled principal payments under our mortgage loans. We also used net sales proceeds from the sales of real estate and our interest in an unconsolidated entity and repaid $135.0 million of outstanding indebtedness collateralized by the senior housing properties sold, repaid $63.8 million of outstanding indebtedness collateralized by two attractions properties and one ski and mountain lifestyle property, repaid all of our senior unsecured notes with an outstanding principal amount of $318.3 million at a premium of 103.625%, and repaid $152.5 million of our revolving line of credit. In August 2016, we terminated our $100.0 million revolving line of credit which matured in August 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , our leverage ratio, calculated as total indebtedness over total assets, was approximately   15%  . 
  Capital Expenditures.   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we funded approximately   $21.8 million   and   $35.8 million   respectively, in capital improvements at our properties. The decrease in amounts funded for capital improvements is primarily attributable to the sale of   22   properties subsequent to September 30, 2015. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.   As described above in "General   Our Exit Strategy," on April 1, 2016, as part of acquiring the remaining 20% interest from our co-venture partner during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed approximately   $5.8 million   to the Intrawest Venture and the Intrawest Venture used the proceeds and repaid a mezzanine loan from its joint venture partner and related accrued interest of   $5.8 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we contributed approximately   $54.6 million   to the Intrawest Venture and the Intrawest Venture repaid two mortgage loans of approximately $54.6 million, which matured in January 2015 and June 2015.   Upon acquiring, for a nominal amount, the remaining interest in the Intrawest Venture, which owned seven ski and mountain lifestyle properties, we began consolidating all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements effective April 1, 2016.  Effective April 2016, we did not own any investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.   
  Related Party Arrangements.   Our Advisor receives asset management fees of 0.075% monthly of average invested assets. Amounts incurred relating to these transactions were approximately   $9.3 million   and   $15.9 million  , including amounts recorded in discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for the   nine months ended September  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our Advisor and its affiliates were also entitled to reimbursement of certain expenses and amounts incurred on our behalf in connection with our operating activities. Reimbursable expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were approximately   $4.0 million   and   $4.3 million  , respectively. Of these amounts, approximately   $0.4 million   are included in due to affiliates in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Pursuant to the advisory agreement, we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which total operating expenses paid or incurred by us exceed the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income (the  Expense Cap ) in any expense year. For the expense years ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , operating expenses did not exceed the Expense Cap. 
  Distributions.   We declared and paid distributions on a quarterly basis through September 30, 2016. The amount of distributions declared to our stockholders was determined by our board of directors and was dependent upon a number of factors, including: 

Sources of cash available for distribution such as expected cash flows from operating activities, Funds from Operations ( FFO ) and Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO  
                
    Limitations and restrictions contained in the terms of our current and future indebtedness concerning the payment of distributions; and 
                
    Other factors such as the avoidance of distribution volatility, our objective of continuing to qualify as a REIT, capital requirements, the general economic environment and other factors. 
     During each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid   $48.8 million   in distributions. Our cash flows from operating activities covered 100% of distributions paid for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  As discussed above under "General   Our Exit Strategy," on November 1, 2016 our board declared a special cash distribution of   $162.6 million  , or   $0.50   per share. In addition, in light of the Plan of Dissolution, our Board approved the suspension of our quarterly cash distribution on our common stock effective as of the fourth quarter distributions. We will not pay quarterly distributions going forward.  
  The following table presents total distributions declared including cash distributions and distributions per share for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data): 

FOOTNOTES: 
           (1) 
    Cash flows from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP were not necessarily indicative of the amount of cash available to pay distributions. The Board also used other measures such as FFO and MFFO in order to evaluate the level of distributions. 
       
  Our cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate due to the seasonality of certain properties. As such, cash flows from operating activities increased during the third quarter as a result of the peak seasonal period of our attractions properties.

As a result of approval by our board of directors to suspend our quarterly cash distribution policy, we will not declare or issue any further distributions on our common stock. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had invested in   43   and   65   properties, respectively, through the following investment structures: 

FOOTNOTES: 
           (1) 
    Upon acquisition of our co-venture partner's 20% interest in April 2016, we owned a 100% controlling interest in the entities that own seven properties and presented these seven properties under wholly-owned leased properties. These properties were classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , and subsequently sold in October 2016.  
              (2) 
    Under applicable tax regulations, certain properties are permitted to be temporarily managed and certain properties are permitted to be indefinitely managed. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our managed properties were temporarily managed. As of   September 30, 2015  , 29 properties were temporarily managed and four properties were indefinitely managed under management agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , wholly-owned managed properties are as follows: 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
  Rental income from operating leases  . Rental income for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased by approximately   $4.1 million   and   $13.0 million  , as compared to the same periods in 2015. Rental income for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from our ski and mountain lifestyle properties increased approximately $4.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively, related to the addition of seven properties we now wholly own after we completed the acquisition of our co-venture partner's 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture in April 2016. Additional billings permitted under our leases calculated as a percentage of ski property level operating revenues generated by our tenants increased by approximately $5.8 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of favorable weather conditions during the peak ski season. Our ski properties in the Pacific Northwest had all-time record low snow conditions for the 2014/2015 ski season, but saw increased revenues for the 2015/2016 ski season due to snowfall returning to more normalized levels in the Pacific Northwest due to a pronounced El Nino effect. However, the same weather phenomenon caused a snow drought and record warm temperatures on the East Coast negatively impacting the 2015/2016 ski season for our properties located in the East.  Rental income from our attractions properties declined by approximately   $1.4 million   and   $2.3 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to amending certain leases, which resulted in lower rents due under the leases, as described further above in  General   Tenant Workouts, Bad Debt Expense and Loan Provisions.   The following information summarizes the rental income from operating leases and base rents for our properties excluding properties that have been classified as discontinued operations (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the weighted-average lease rate for our portfolio of wholly-owned leased properties (excluding assets held for sale) was 10.0% and 10.2%, respectively. These rates are based on annualized straight-line base rent due under our leases and the weighted-average contractual lease basis of our real estate investment properties subject to operating leases. The weighted-average lease rate of our portfolio may fluctuate based on our asset mix, timing of property acquisitions, lease terminations and reductions in rent granted to tenants. 
  Property operating revenues  . Property operating revenues from managed properties, which are not subject to leasing arrangements, are derived from room rentals, food and beverage sales, ski and spa operations, ticket sales, concessions, waterpark and theme park operations, and other service revenues. The following information summarizes the revenues of our properties that are operated by third-party managers (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had a total of 12 and 16 managed properties (excluding properties that we classified as discontinued operations), respectively, of which certain properties are operated seasonally due to geographic location, climate and weather patterns. The decrease in property operating revenues is primarily due to the sale of four attraction properties and the Omni Mt. Washington Resort, our one managed ski and mountain lifestyle property, during the first half of 2015. 
  Interest income on mortgages and other notes receivable.   For the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we earned interest income of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively. There was no interest income on mortgages and other notes receivable during the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as all of our notes receivables were collected during 2015. 
  Property operating expenses.   Property operating expenses decreased primarily due to the sale of four attraction properties and the Omni Mt. Washington Resort, our one managed ski and mountain lifestyle property, during the first half of 2015. The following information summarizes the expenses of our properties that are operated by third-party managers (in thousands):

Asset management fees to advisor.   Monthly asset management fees equal to 0.075% of invested assets are paid to the Advisor for the management of our real estate assets, loans and other permitted investments. For the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , asset management fees to our Advisor were approximately   $3.0 million   and   $9.1 million  , respectively, as compared to approximately   $3.7 million   and   $12.2 million  , respectively, for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in such fees is primarily attributable to a decrease in invested assets under management due to the sale of   55   properties in 2015 and six properties in 2016. 
  General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses totaled approximately   $2.9 million   and   $10.8 million   for quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.0 million   and   $11.5 million  , respectively, for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a reduction in legal, accounting and other professional services necessary to account and report on a declining portfolio of assets due to asset sales as a result of our exit strategy, as described above in  General   Our Exit Strategy.  
  Ground leases and permit fees.   Ground lease payments and land permit fees are generally based on a percentage of gross revenue of the underlying property over certain thresholds. For properties that are subject to leasing arrangements, ground leases and permit fees are paid by the tenants in accordance with the terms of our leases with those tenants and we record the corresponding equivalent revenues in rental income from operating leases. For the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , ground lease and land permit fees were approximately   $2.3 million   and   $8.7 million  , respectively, as compared to   $2.4 million   and   $7.8 million  , respectively, for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in ground leases and permit fees is primarily due to additional billings permitted under our leases calculated as a percentage of ski property level operating revenues generated by our tenants. 
  Other operating expenses.   Other operating expenses were approximately   $4.1 million   and   $10.1 million   for each of the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $1.7 million   and   $4.9 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase during the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is primarily attributable to expenses related to seven properties effective with the April 1, 2016 acquisition of our co-venture partner's 20% interest in the Intrawest Venture as described above in "General - Our Exit Strategy," and an increase in repair and maintenance expenses related to our properties subject to operating leases. 
    
  Bad debt (recovery) expense.   Bad debt recovery totaled   $(0.2) million   and   $(18.0) thousand   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to expense of approximately   $3.3 million   and   $8.1 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. As described above in  General   Tenant Workouts, Bad Debt Expense and Loan Provisions , during 2015, one of our ski tenants with two leases on properties in the Pacific-Northwest experienced financial difficulties as a result of lower operating results from the low levels of snow accompanied by unusually warm weather. No bad debt expense was recorded related to this tenant during the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   because snowfall levels improved in the fourth quarter of 2015, and this tenant has paid rental amounts related to the current ski season that started in the fall of 2015. 
  Loan loss provision.   Loan loss provision was approximately   $21.0 thousand   and   $9.4 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as described in "General - Tenant Workouts, Bad Debt Expenses and Loan Provisions."  This related to two borrowers of our mortgage note receivables who continued to experience financial difficulties and we recorded the loans  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

at their net realizable values at   September 30, 2015  . All mortgage and notes receivables were collected in full during 2015.  Accordingly. there was no loan loss provision during the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Impairment provision.   Impairment provision was approximately   $8.1 million   for each of the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As described above in "General   Tenant Workouts, Bad Debt Expense and Loan Provisions," we entered into a purchase and sale agreement and adjusted the net carrying value of certain properties to the estimated sales price, less estimated closing costs.  Impairment provision was approximately   $1.4 million   for each of the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which related to an adjustment to the net carrying value of our undeveloped land due to a revised estimated sale price, less estimated closing costs.  
  Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately   $16.2 million   and   $49.7 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $19.8 million   and   $63.5 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a lower depreciable basis of certain of our properties as a result of impairment provisions recorded in December 2015 and as a result of five properties that were sold in 2015 that did not qualify as discontinued operations. 
  Interest and other (expense) income.   Interest and other (expense) income was approximately (  $0.1 million  ) and   $1.0 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Interest expense and loan cost amortization.   Interest expense and loan cost amortization was approximately   $2.7 million   and   $8.4 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $3.2 million   and   $23.9 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to repayment of approximately $621.9 million in 2015 related to our senior unsecured notes, line of credit and other indebtedness. 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt.   Losses on extinguishment of debt were approximately   $25 thousand   for each of the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the loss on extinguishment of debt was approximately   $21.1 million  .  The losses incurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the early repayments of our senior unsecured notes and certain loans during 2015. Loss on extinguishment of debt included legal fees incurred with the transaction, prepayment penalty fees and the write-off of unamortized bond issue costs and loan costs.  
  Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities.   The following table summarizes equity in earnings (loss) from our unconsolidated entities (in thousands): 

As described above in "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities  ,"   in April 2015 we sold our 81.98% interest in the DMC Partnership and on April 1, 2016, we acquired our co-venture partner s 20% non-controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture, which resulted in a combined 100% controlling interest in the Intrawest Venture  .    As a result, we began consolidating all of the results of operations of the Intrawest Venture.  We did not own any investments in unconsolidated entities as of   September 30, 2016   and will not record equity in earnings going forward.  
  Gain from purchase of controlling interest in investment in unconsolidated entity.     Gain from purchase of the remaining 20% interest in our Intrawest Venture effective April 1, 2016, was approximately   $30.0 million   for the   nine months ended September  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

30, 2016  . We did not acquire any interests in unconsolidated entities during the   quarter ended September 30, 2016   or the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Gain (loss) on sale of real estate.     Gain (loss) on sale of real estate from continuing operations was approximately   $0.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and approximately (  $1.1 million  ) and   $26.5 million   for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The gain (loss) on sale of real estate relates primarily to the sale of our unimproved land during 2016 and one of our attractions properties during 2015.  
  Gain from sale of unconsolidated entity.     Gain from sale of our interest in the DMC Partnership, our unconsolidated entity, was approximately $39.3 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . We did not sell any interest in  unconsolidated entities during 2016.  
  Income tax provision.   Income tax provision was approximately $  3.1 million   for each of the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to   $8.4 million   and   $9.1 million   for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The income tax provision was recorded as a result of our potential failure to satisfy the gross income tests applicable to REITs, as further described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies   Revision to Previously Issued Financial Statements" of Item 1. "Financial Statements." 
  Discontinued operations.   Income from discontinued operations was approximately   $9.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $214.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . There was no income from discontinued operations for the   quarter ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $7.6 million   for the   quarter ended September 30, 2015  .  The results of operations of five marinas properties and 50 senior housing and marinas properties owned during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, income from discontinued operations included gains on sale of assets of   $9.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from the sale of five properties and gains on sale of assets of   $210.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   from the sale of 38 properties. See Note 4.  Assets Held for Sale, net and Discontinued Operations  for additional information. 
  We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the acquisition and operation of properties, loans and other permitted investments, other than those described above, risk factors, if any, identified in Part II, Item 1A of this report and the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds From Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, real estate impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above. 
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value of the property. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below,  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or loss in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 
  Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses for business combinations from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses as items that are expensed under GAAP and accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we acquired our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe it is presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income or loss: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to straight-line rent adjustments for leases and notes receivable; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt and hedges; amounts relating to the amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to remove the impact of GAAP straight-line adjustments from rental revenues); loan loss provisions related to mortgages and other notes receivable; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; eliminations of adjustments relating to contingent purchase price obligations where such adjustments have been included in the derivation of GAAP net income or loss, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income or loss; and adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all of our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations. 
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, straight-line adjustments for leases and notes receivable, amortization of above and below market leases, impairments of lease related assets, loss from early extinguishment of debt and accretion of discounts or amortization of premiums for debt investments. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income or loss. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income or loss in determining cash flow from operating activities. 
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisitions costs are funded from our subscription proceeds and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information. 
  Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way and as such comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of its liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund cash needs including our ability to make distributions to stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value or based on an estimated net asset value. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO. 
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust its calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income or loss to FFO and MFFO for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data):

    Net gain on sale of real estate investment includes gain on insurance proceeds and loss on retirement of property. 
              (2) 
    In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of our co-venture partner's 20% interest in one unconsolidated joint venture that held seven properties.  See "Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities" for additional information. 
              (3) 
    In April 2015, we completed the sale of our interest in one unconsolidated joint venture that held one property. See  Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities  for additional information. 
              (4) 
    While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. 
              (5) 
    This amount represents our share of the FFO or MFFO adjustments allowable under the NAREIT or IPA definitions, respectively, multiplied by the percentage of income or loss recognized under the HLBV method. 
              (6) 
    Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using various methodologies. This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance. 
              (7) 
    Loss on extinguishment of debt includes legal fees incurred with the transaction, prepayment penalty fees and write-off of unamortized loan costs, as applicable. Loss from extinguishment of cash flow hedge includes swap breakage fees and reclassification of loss on termination of cash flow hedges from other comprehensive income (loss) from interest expense. 
              (8) 
    We recorded loan loss provisions on our mortgages and other notes receivable as a result of uncertainty related to the collectability of these notes receivables. 
              (9) 
    Management believes that adjusting for write-offs of lease related assets is appropriate because they are non-cash adjustments that may  not be reflective of our ongoing operating performance.  During each of the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded impairment provisions totaling approximately   $8.1 million   for deferred rent from prior GAAP straight-lining adjustments.   
     Off-Balance Sheet and Other Arrangements 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had an 80% interest in the Intrawest Venture.  In April 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest from our co-venture partner and own 100% of the Intrawest Venture.  No off balance sheet arrangements existed as of   September 30, 2016  .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties, make loans and other permitted investments. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we expect to borrow and lend primarily at fixed-rates or variable-rates with the lowest margins available, and in some cases, with the ability to convert variable-rates to fixed-rates. With regard to variable-rate financing, we will assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. 
  The following is a schedule of our fixed and variable debt maturities for each of the next five years, and thereafter (in thousands): 

FOOTNOTES: 
           (1) 
    The fair value of our fixed-rate debt was determined using discounted cash flows based on market interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . We determined market rates through discussions with our existing lenders pricing our loans with similar terms and current rates and spreads. 
              (2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , some of our variable-rate debt in mortgages and notes payable was hedged. 
               (4) 
    We have a $1.4 million loan that is non-interest bearing. 
     Management estimates that a hypothetical one-percentage point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in additional interest costs of approximately   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions, and although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates, it is not intended to predict future results and our actual results will likely vary. 
  We were exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of our direct ownership of three properties in Canada, one of which was leased to a third-party tenant. The lease payments we receive under our leases are denominated in Canadian dollars. Management does not believe this to be a significant risk or that currency fluctuations would result in a significant impact to our overall results of operations. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
  During the most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
