1.    MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIONS  
    
  Principles of Consolidation     The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited and have been prepared by management of Cabela s Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( Cabela s,   Company,   we,  or  our ) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   January 2, 2016  , was derived from the Company s audited consolidated balance sheet as of that date. All other condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to summarize fairly our financial position and results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the periods presented. All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
    
  World s Foremost Bank ( WFB,   Financial Services segment,  or  Cabela s CLUB ), a Nebraska banking corporation and a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of Cabela s, is the primary beneficiary of the Cabela s Master Credit Card Trust and related entities (collectively referred to as the  Trust ). The Trust was consolidated for all reporting periods of Cabela s in this report.  
  Because of the seasonal nature of the Company s operations, results of operations of any single reporting period should not be considered as indicative of results for a full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents of the Financial Services segment were   $94 million  ,   $157 million  , and   $45 million   at   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Due to regulatory restrictions on WFB, the Company cannot use WFB s cash for non-banking operations.     
    
  Segment Reporting     Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the Company realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments. The Company now accounts for its operations as two operating segments: Merchandising and Financial Services. For more information on this change in segments see Note 14  Segment Reporting  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Reporting Periods     Unless otherwise stated, the fiscal periods referred to in the notes to these condensed consolidated financial statements are the 13 weeks ended   October 1, 2016   ( three months ended   October 1, 2016   ), the 13 weeks ended   September 26, 2015   ( three months ended   September 26, 2015   ), the 39 weeks ended   October 1, 2016   ( nine months ended   October 1, 2016   ), the 39 weeks ended   September 26, 2015   ( nine months ended   September 26, 2015   ), and the 53 weeks ended   January 2, 2016   ( fiscal   year ended 2015   ). WFB follows a calendar fiscal period and, accordingly, the respective three and nine month periods ended on   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and the fiscal year ended on   December 31, 2015  .

Adoption of New Accounting Principles     In the three months ended April 2, 2016, we adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which required that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The following table summarizes the effects of this new guidance on amounts previously reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the periods ended:   

  In addition, effective in fiscal   year ended 2015  , we adopted on a prospective basis the provisions of ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  This standard simplified the presentation of deferred income taxes and required that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non current in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted; therefore, deferred income taxes of   $16 million   were presented as current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 26, 2015  . 

2.    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS         
    
  On October 3, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), by and among Bass Pro Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Bass Pro Group ), Prairie Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bass Pro Group ( Sub ) and the Company. The Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been unanimously approved by the Company s board of directors (the  Company Board ).   
  The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Sub with and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the  Merger ), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Bass Pro Group. 
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the  Effective Time ), each share of Class A common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of the Company ( Company Common Stock ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive   $65.50   in cash, without interest thereon (the  Merger Consideration ), other than (i) shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) shares owned of record by Bass Pro Group, Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries, and (iii) shares held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have properly demanded appraisal of such shares and complied in all respects with all the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law concerning the right of holders of shares to require appraisal.

The consummation of the Merger, which is expected to close in the first half of 2017, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the consummation of the purchase and sale of the banking business of WFB, in accordance with the Bank Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and merger of WFB into the Company or another subsidiary of the Company and termination of its bank charter, (iii) any applicable waiting periods (or extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 having expired or been terminated, (iv) the absence of any order by any governmental entity rendering the Merger illegal, or prohibiting, enjoining or otherwise preventing the Merger, and (v) other customary closing conditions.  
  Additionally, in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016 (the  Bank Purchase Agreement ), by and among the Company, WFB, and Capital One, National Association ( Capital One ). The Bank Purchase Agreement provides for, in connection with the closing of the Merger, the sale to Capital One of the business of WFB, which includes the credit card program operated by the Company, using WFB as the issuer. Pursuant to the Bank Purchase Agreement, WFB has agreed to sell to Capital One, and Capital One has agreed to purchase from WFB, substantially all of the assets of WFB, including the Cabela s Club credit card co-branded accounts and WFB s equity interests in the securitization funding vehicles WFB Funding, LLC and WFB Funding Corporation. Pursuant to the Bank Purchase Agreement, Capital One has also agreed to assume certain liabilities of WFB. The consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Bank Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the filing of required notices and the obtainment of required consents from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance; (ii) the absence of any order prohibiting or making illegal the transactions; (iii) the continued effectiveness of the associated Bank Program Agreement; (iv) the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (v) in the case of Capital One, the absence of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition (as defined in the Bank Purchase Agreement); (vi) receipt of written notice from each of S P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and DBRS, Inc. that the transaction described in the Bank Purchase Agreement and related transaction documents will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of its then-existing rating with respect to any outstanding series or class with respect to which it is a rating agency; (vii) termination of each outstanding series of variable funding notes issued by the Trust; (viii) the receipt of legal and tax opinions and other customary documentation required in connection with the transfer of securitization vehicles; and (ix) customary closing conditions. 
  The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Bass Pro Group, and in certain specified circumstances upon termination of the Merger Agreement the Company would be required to pay Bass Pro Group a termination fee of   $126 million  . The Bank Purchase Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Capital One, and in certain circumstances the Company would be required to pay Capital One a termination fee of   $14 million  .  
  Additional information about the Merger Agreement, the Bank Purchase Agreement, and the related transactions can be found in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 7, 2016. 

3.    CABELA S MASTER CREDIT CARD TRUST 
    
  The Financial Services segment utilizes the Trust for the purpose of routinely securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors. The Trust issues variable funding facilities and long-term notes (collectively referred to herein as  secured obligations of the Trust ), each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the Trust. The Financial Services segment owns notes issued by the Trust from some of the securitizations, which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued.

The Trust sold asset-backed notes of   $1.0 billion   ( Series 2016-I ) on June 29, 2016. The Series 2016-I securitization transaction included the issuance of   $570 million   Class A-1 notes, which accrue interest at a fixed rate of   1.78%   per year,   $280 million   of Class A-2 notes, which accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus   0.85%   per year, and three subordinated classes of notes in the aggregate principal amount of   $150 million  .  
  The Financial Services segment retained each of the subordinated classes of notes which were eliminated in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Each class of notes issued in the Series 2016-I securitization transaction have an expected life of approximately three years and a contractual maturity of approximately six years. The securitization transaction was and will continue to be used to fund the growth in restricted credit card loans, maturities of time deposits, and future obligations of the Trust. In addition, the Series 2011-II (  $255 million  ) notes matured and were repaid in full using restricted cash of the Trust on June 15, 2016. 
  The Trust also issues variable funding facilities which are considered secured obligations backed by restricted credit card loans. At   October 1, 2016  , the Trust had three variable funding facilities with total capacity of   $1.8 billion   of which   $75 million   was outstanding. On September 29, 2016, the Trust increased the   $500 million   Series 2011-III variable funding facility due March 2017 to   $700 million   and extended its maturity date to September 2019. In addition, on September 29, 2016, the Trust increased the   $500 million   Series 2011-I variable funding facility that is due March 2019 to   $800 million  . The aforementioned increases to these two variable funding facilities made on September 29, 2016, which brought the total capacity of the variable funding facilities to   $1.8 billion  , are for a one year period ending September 29, 2017, at which time the total capacity will revert back to   $1.3 billion  . At   October 1, 2016  , maturities for the three variable funding facilities were as follows: 
     Each of these variable funding facilities includes an option to renew subject to certain terms and conditions. Variable rate note interest is priced at a benchmark rate, LIBOR, or commercial paper rate, plus a spread, which ranges from   0.80%   to   0.90%  . The variable rate notes provide for a fee ranging from   0.40%   to   0.50%   on the unused portion of the facilities. During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the daily average balance outstanding on these notes was   $233 million   and   $82 million  , with a weighted average interest rate of   1.23%   and   0.80%  , respectively.  
  The Financial Services segment has unsecured federal funds purchase agreements with two financial institutions. The maximum amount that can be borrowed is   $100 million  . There were   no   amounts outstanding at   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , or   September 26, 2015  .

6.     LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES  
     
  Long-term debt, including revolving credit facilities and capital leases, consisted of the following at the periods ended: 

The Company s credit agreement provides for an unsecured   $775 million   revolving credit facility and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to   $75 million   and swing line loans up to   $30 million  . The credit facility may be increased to   $800 million   subject to certain terms and conditions. The term of the credit facility expires on June 18, 2019. 
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the daily average principal balance outstanding on the line of credit was   $255 million   and   $404 million  , respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was   1.83%   and   1.43%  , respectively. Letters of credit and standby letters of credit totaling   $24 million   and   $28 million   were outstanding at   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. The daily average outstanding amount of total letters of credit during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , was   $14 million   and   $22 million  , respectively. 
  On February 27, 2016, we repaid our unsecured notes for   $215 million   from the proceeds of the private placement sale of unsecured senior notes in August 2015 for   $550 million  . 
  The Company also has an unsecured   $20 million   Canadian ( CAD ) revolving credit facility for its operations in Canada.  Borrowings are payable on demand with interest payable monthly. This credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to   $10 million   CAD in the aggregate, which reduces the overall available credit limit. 
  At   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the financial covenant requirements of its   $775 million   credit agreement with a fixed charge coverage ratio of   7.75   to   1   (minimum requirement is 2.00 to 1), a leverage ratio of   1.82   to   1   (requirement is no more than 3.00 to 1), and a consolidated net worth that was   $632 million   in excess of the minimum, as defined in the agreement. At   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under its credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured senior notes through at least the next 12 months.

7.     IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  
    
  Impairment and restructuring charges consisted of the following for the periods presented:     

Impairment     We evaluate the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangibles whenever indicators of impairment exist. In the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recognized impairment losses related to three parcels of land based on sales contracts for two properties and an appraisal for another property where, after the impairment losses were recognized, the total carrying value of these properties approximated   $3 million  . In the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , we recognized an impairment loss on a parcel of unimproved land based on an appraisal we received in July 2015. After the impairment loss was recognized, the carrying value of this particular property was   $1 million  . These impairment losses were recognized in the Merchandising segment.  
    
  Local economic trends, government regulations, and other restrictions where we own properties may impact management projections that could change undiscounted cash flows in future periods which could trigger possible future write downs. 
    
  Restructuring Charges     In the respective   three   and   nine   month periods ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , we incurred charges for severance and related benefits primarily attributable to our corporate restructuring and reduction in the number of personnel. These charges for all periods were recognized in the Merchandising segment.      
  The activity relating to the liability for these severance benefits, which was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, is summarized in the following table for the periods presented:

8.     INCOME TAXES  
    
  The effective income tax rate was   35.9%   and   37.5%   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to   35.8%   and   35.5%   for the respective   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
    
  At   October 1, 2016  , unrecognized tax benefits totaling   $70 million   were included in other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets compared to   $73 million   at   January 2, 2016  . At   September 26, 2015  , unrecognized tax benefits totaling   $46 million   were included in current liabilities (accrued expenses and other liabilities) and   $69 million   in other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The changes compared to the balances at   September 26, 2015  , were due primarily to our assessments of uncertain tax positions related to prior period tax positions and settlement of our 2007 and 2008 Internal Revenue Service examinations. Since the Company is routinely under audit by various taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months. However, we do not expect the change, if any, to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations within the next 12 months. 

9.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
    
  The Company leases various buildings, computer and other equipment, and storage space under operating leases which expire on various dates through January 2041. Rent expense on these leases, as well as other month to month rentals, was   $5 million   and   $16 million   in the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $6 million   and   $17 million   in the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .     
  The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments under operating leases at   October 1, 2016  :  

The Company leases seven retail stores and owns 24 stores subject to ground leases. Certain of these leases include tenant allowances that are amortized over the life of the lease.   No   tenant allowances were received in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   September 26, 2015  . The Company does not expect to receive any tenant allowances under leases during the remainder of fiscal year 2016. 
  We have entered into real estate purchase, construction, and/or economic incentive agreements for various new retail store site locations. At   October 1, 2016  , we estimated we had total cash commitments of approximately   $109 million   outstanding for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores. This amount excludes any estimated costs associated with new stores where the Company does not have a commitment as of   October 1, 2016  . We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures over the next 12 months with funds from operations and borrowings.

In the past, we have received grant funding in exchange for commitments, such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at the retail store or that the retail store will remain open, made by us to the state or local government providing the funding. If we failed to maintain the commitments during the applicable period, the funds received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise, which could affect the Company s cash flows and profitability. The total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was   $42 million   at   October 1, 2016  , and   $43 million   at both   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  .   No   grant funding subject to contractual remedy was received in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   September 26, 2015  . At   October 1, 2016  , we had recorded   $17 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants with   $16 million   in current liabilities and   $1 million   in long-term liabilities. At   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the amount the Company had recorded in current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants was   $17 million   and   $23 million  , respectively. 
  The Company operates an open account document instructions program, which provides for Cabela s-issued letters of credit. We had obligations to pay participating vendors   $70 million  ,   $34 million  , and   $53 million   at   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Financial Services segment enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business through the origination of unsecured credit card loans. Unsecured credit card accounts are commitments to extend credit and totaled   $36 billion  ,   $35 billion  , and   $34 billion   at   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. These commitments are in addition to any current outstanding balances of a cardholder. Unsecured credit card loans involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The principal amounts of these instruments reflect the Financial Services segment s maximum related exposure. The Financial Services segment has the right to reduce or cancel the available lines of credit at any time, and has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all customers will exercise the entire available line of credit at any given point in time.    
  Litigation and Claims     The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  These actions include commercial, intellectual property, employment, regulatory, and product liability claims. Some of these actions involve complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. The activities of WFB are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. WFB's regulators are authorized to conduct compliance examinations and impose penalties for violations of these laws and regulations and, in some cases, to order WFB to pay restitution. The Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of the actions brought against it. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the period in which such development, settlement, or resolution occurs. However, the Company does not believe that the outcome of any current legal proceedings will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position taken as a whole.      
  In April 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with the Company and its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ralph Castner, that resolves the previously disclosed SEC investigation into certain disclosures, reserves, and accruals from fiscal year 2012. As part of the settlement, the SEC entered an administrative cease-and-desist order that directs the Company and Mr. Castner to comply with the disclosure, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws going forward. The Company and Mr. Castner neither admitted nor denied the allegations related to the settlement. The penalty of   $1 million   associated with the Company s settlement was recognized as a liability that was accrued for and expensed by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. 
    
  The Company is party to a lawsuit in California state court alleging that the Company violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by recording various telephone calls from California consumers without their consent. The Company has reached a preliminary settlement in this lawsuit, which is subject to court approval. In connection with this lawsuit the Company recognized a liability of   $3.85 million   in the   three   months ended April 2, 2016. 
  The Company is party to a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging that the Company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by placing calls using an automatic telephone dialing system to cellular telephones without first obtaining consent due to reassignment of the number or revocation of prior consent. At the present time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from this matter. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability related to this matter.

10.     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS      
       
  Stock-Based Compensation     The Company recognized total stock-based compensation expense of   $6 million   and   $19 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   $6 million   and   $16 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Compensation expense related to the Company s stock-based payment awards is recognized in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. At   October 1, 2016  , the total unrecognized deferred stock-based compensation balance for all equity awards issued, net of expected forfeitures, was   $31 million  , net of tax, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of   2.6   years. 
    
  Employee Stock Plans     Since June 5, 2013, all awards are granted under the Cabela s Incorporated 2013 Stock Plan (the  2013 Stock Plan ) and have a term of no greater than ten years from the grant date and become exercisable under the vesting schedule determined at the time of grant. As of   October 1, 2016  , the maximum number of shares available for awards under the 2013 Stock Plan was   2,001,427  . As of   October 1, 2016  , there were   1,729,466   awards outstanding under the 2013 Stock Plan and   1,101,716   awards outstanding under the Cabela s Incorporated 2004 Stock Plan. To the extent available, we will issue treasury shares for the exercise of stock options before issuing new shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of Bass Pro Group, no option awards or stock unit awards may be granted under the 2013 Stock Plan beginning on or after October 3, 2016. 
    
  Option Awards.   During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , there were   163,000   non-statutory stock options ( NSOs ) granted to employees at an exercise price of   $48.40   per share and   25,112   NSOs granted to non-employee directors at an exercise price of   $50.45   per share. These options have an eight-year term and vest over four years for employees and over one year for non-employee directors. In addition, on March 2, 2016, the Company issued   64,000   premium-priced NSOs to its Chief Executive Officer at an exercise price of   $55.66   (which was equal to 115% of the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2016). The premium-priced NSOs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on March 2, 2017, and expire on March 2, 2024. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , there were   464,510   options exercised. The aggregate intrinsic value of all awards exercised was   $31 million   and   $21 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Based on the Company s closing stock price of   $54.93   at   October 1, 2016  , the total number of in-the-money awards exercisable as of   October 1, 2016  , was   1,000,408  . 
    
  Nonvested Stock and Stock Unit Awards.   During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , there were   425,907   units of nonvested stock issued to employees at a weighted average fair value of   $47.35   per unit and   12,885   units of nonvested stock issued to non-employee directors at a fair value of   $50.45   per unit. These nonvested stock awards vest evenly over four years on the grant date anniversary based on the passage of time for employees and over one year for non-employee directors. On   March 2, 2016  , the Company also issued   92,500   units of performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives at a fair value of   $48.40   per unit. These performance-based restricted stock units will begin vesting in four equal annual installments on   March 2, 2017  , if the performance criterion is achieved.     
       
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan     During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , there were   60,721   shares issued under the Cabela s Incorporated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan with   1,751,574   shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance as of   October 1, 2016  . Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, no shares may be purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan with respect to offering periods beginning on or after October 3, 2016.

11. 
    STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 
       
  Retained Earnings     The most significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Company to stockholders are contained within the covenants under its revolving credit and unsecured senior notes purchase agreements. Also, Nebraska banking laws govern the amount of dividends that WFB can pay to Cabela s. On   February 11, 2016  , WFB paid a dividend of   $40 million   to Cabela s. At   October 1, 2016  , the Company had unrestricted retained earnings of   $225 million   available for dividends. However, the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is also prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends or other distributions on its common stock. The Company does not anticipate paying any dividends or other distributions on its common stock in the foreseeable future. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss     The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related taxes, are as follows for the periods ended: 

Treasury Stock     On   September 1, 2015  , we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to   $500 million   of its common stock over a two-year period. This authorization was in addition to the standing annual authorization to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from equity-based awards issued under the Company s equity compensation plans. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time  .   We did not engage in any stock repurchase activity in the three and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . As of   October 1, 2016  , up to   $426 million   of authorization to repurchase our common stock remained under this program. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company generally may not repurchase shares of its common stock, except in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or the settlement of restricted stock unit awards. As a result, the Company does not anticipate repurchasing any further shares under this program.

14.     SEGMENT REPORTING  
  Guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280,  Segment Reporting,  requires companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments periodically and when certain events occur. Changes in the first quarter of 2016 in our executive management structure and responsibilities resulted in a change in the Company s chief operating decision maker function. As a result of these changes, as well as the finalization and implementation of our Vision 2020 strategic plan at the beginning of fiscal year 2016, and operational changes in our organizational structure, the Company updated its reportable segments effective the beginning of fiscal year 2016. The Company now accounts for its operations as two reportable segments: Merchandising and Financial Services.  
  The Merchandising segment sells products and services through the Company s retail stores, our e-commerce websites (Cabelas.com and Cabelas.ca), and our catalogs. The United States merchandising and Canada merchandising operating segments have been aggregated into our reportable Merchandising segment. We are an omni-channel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including retail stores, online, and mobile channels, and have it fulfilled, in most cases, either through in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of our distribution centers, retail stores, or vendor drop-ship. Other non-merchandise revenue included in our Merchandising segment primarily includes the value of unredeemed points earned that are associated with the Company s loyalty rewards programs for Cabela s CLUB issued credit cards, net of the estimated costs of the points; real estate rental income; and real estate land sales. 
    
  The Financial Services segment issues co-branded credit cards which are available through all of our channels. Our Cabela s CLUB cardholders also earn points from our loyalty rewards programs that can be redeemed through all of our customer shopping channels. 
    
  Results for the three and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , presented in the tables below and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Three Months Ended     October 1, 2016  , Compared to   September 26, 2015  ,  and    Nine Months Ended     October 1, 2016  , Compared to   September 26, 2015  ,  presented herein, have been recast to reflect these new segments.

    Costs relating to receiving, distribution, and storage of inventory; and merchandising, order processing, and quality assurance costs.

    Advertising and promotion, license fees, third party services for processing credit card transactions, employee compensation and benefits, and other general and administrative costs. 
       
  Segment assets are those directly used in each operating segment s operations. Depreciation, amortization, and property and equipment expenditures are recognized as directly expensed and used in each respective segment. Major assets by segment are summarized below. 
  Merchandising Segment: 
             
    Land, buildings, fixtures, and leasehold improvements, including corporate headquarters and facilities. 
                
    In-store inventory, receivables, and prepaid expenses. 
                
    Merchandise distribution inventory, technology infrastructure and related information technology systems, corporate cash and cash equivalents, economic development bonds, deferred income taxes, and other corporate long-lived assets. 
       
  Financial Services Segment: 
             
    Cash, credit card loans, restricted cash, receivables, property and equipment, and other assets. 
       
  Under an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Merchandising segment a fixed license fee that includes   70   basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela s CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Merchandising segment for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Merchandising segment. This reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Merchandising segment for certain promotional costs was eliminated in consolidation. Also, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than   13%   at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Merchandising segment equal to   50%   of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds   13%  . No additional license fee was paid in either the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
     Financial instrument assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
             
    Level 1   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted market prices. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs corroborated by little, if any, market data. Level 3 is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are primarily unobservable from objective sources.  
     At   October 1, 2016  , the financial instruments subject to fair value measurements carried on our condensed consolidated balance sheets consisted of economic development bonds (included in other assets) and were classified as Level 3 for valuation purposes. There were no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2, or 3 for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  .

There were no significant changes in the fair value of the economic development bonds which are measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the fiscal   year ended 2015   or the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
  There were   no   other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and   no   adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   September 26, 2015  . In the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recognized impairment losses related to three parcels of land based on sales contracts for two properties and an appraisal for another property where, after the impairment losses were recognized, the total carrying value of these properties approximated   $3 million  . In the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , we recognized an impairment loss on a parcel of unimproved land based on an appraisal we received in July 2015. After the impairment loss was recognized, the carrying value of this particular property was   $1 million  . 
  The table below presents the estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the periods indicated. The fair values of all financial instruments listed below were estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing observable inputs (Level 2).

16.    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  The following accounting standards are grouped by their effective date applicable to the Company: 
  Effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2017: 
  In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ). Under this standard, inventory will be measured at the  lower of cost and net realizable value  and options that currently exist for  market value  will be eliminated. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  We have evaluated the provisions of this statement and do not believe that it will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). This standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, and classifications in the statement of cash flows. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement and have not determined what impact ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2018: 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement and do not intend to apply early adoption. We have not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  Effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019: 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). Under this standard, operating and finance leases with a lease term of more than 12 months will be recorded in the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with offsetting lease liabilities based on the present value of future lease payments. The standard also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Early adoption is permitted and requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement, including which period to adopt, and have not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  Effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2020: 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 will change the accounting for credit impairment by adding an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this standard, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement, including which period to adopt, and have not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

17.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  On October 17, 2016, the Series 2011-IV notes of the Trust totaling   $255 million   were repaid in full using restricted cash of the Trust. Also, on October 25, 2016, the Trust increased its   $300 million   variable funding facility due March 2018 to   $500 million  . The increase to this variable funding facility is for a one year period ending October 25, 2017, at which time the variable funding facility will revert back to   $300 million  .     
    
  On October 21, 2016, the Company paid   $16 million   to satisfy in full a liability judgment, including interest, entered against the Company in February 2014 related to a radius restriction of a retail store and associated incentives and value of real property. Pursuant to this judgment, the Company had recognized this liability in its consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal year ended 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 recognized the amount of interest ordered to pay through a supplemental judgment in March 2014.

Executive Overview 
    
  We are a leading specialty omni-channel retailer of hunting, fishing, camping, shooting sports, and related outdoor merchandise. We provide a quality service to our customers who are able to access our multiple channels when making a purchase, including retail stores, online, and mobile channels. We supply our customers products through our multi-channel merchandising distribution network consisting of in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of our distribution centers, retail stores, or vendor drop-ship. Cabela s CLUB also plays an integral role in supporting our merchandising business. The Financial Services segment is comprised of our credit card services, which reinforce our strong brand and strengthen our customer loyalty through our credit card loyalty programs.    
  Results on the following strategic focus areas of the Company   (i) improve top-line sales, (ii) increase bottom-line profits, (iii) retail store expansion, and (iv) grow the CLUB, are discussed below. 
  We operate 85 stores, including the eight new stores that we opened in 2016 as follows:     
             
    Lexington, Kentucky; and League City, Texas; in March;  
                 
    Short Pump, Virginia; Centerville, Ohio; and Farmington, Utah; in April;  
                
    Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada; in June; 
                
    Avon, Ohio; in August; and  
                
    Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; in September. 
       
  We now have   74   stores located in the United States and   11   in Canada. Our total retail square footage is now   8.5 million   square feet, which represents an 8% increase compared to our 7.9 million of retail square feet at the end of 2015. We are currently evaluating store locations and new stores to open beyond 2016. We have announced plans to open new stores in Gainesville, Virginia; Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada; McDonough, Georgia; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Chesterfield Township, Michigan; and El Paso, Texas. 
  
   34 

Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2016, we realigned our organizational structure and updated our reportable operating segments into two segments   Merchandising and Financial Services. Results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , have been recast to reflect these new segments and are presented in the tables below and in the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For more information on this change in segments see Note 14  Segment Reporting  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Comparisons and analysis of selected financial data are presented below for the following periods: 

Revenues in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , totaled   $996 million  , an increase of   $70 million  , or   7.6%  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Merchandise sales increased   $57 million   comparing the respective periods with the most significant factors contributing to the increase as follows: 
             
    An increase of   $63 million   due to the addition of new retail stores.  
                
    Comparable store sales on a consolidated basis for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , on a shift-adjusted calendar basis, decreased   $14 million  , or   2.3%  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The adjustment of comparable store sales on a shift-adjusted calendar basis provides a more accurate performance of our comparable store sales by aligning the weeks of operation in the current fiscal year to the most comparable weeks in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing the respective periods was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 4.3%, partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 2.7%. 
     
   35 

Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased   1.8%   compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , reflected mostly in the clothing and footwear product category. 
             
    An increase of   $6 million  , or   3.6%  , in Internet and catalog sales, which was primarily due to an increase in the hunting equipment product category. 
     Revenues in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , totaled   $2.8 billion  , an increase of   $201 million  , or   7.8%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Merchandise sales increased   $160 million   comparing the respective periods with the most significant factors contributing to the net increase as follows: 
             
    An increase of   $198 million   due to the addition of new retail stores. 
                
    Comparable store sales on a consolidated basis for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , on a shift-adjusted calendar basis, decreased   $27 million  , or   1.7%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The decrease in comparable store sales comparing the respective periods was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.8%, partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 6.2%. 
     Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased   1.2%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , mostly due to a decrease in the clothing and footwear product category, partially offset by an increase in the hunting equipment product category. 
             
    A decrease of   $7 million  , or   1.6%  , in Internet and catalog sales, which was primarily due to decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. 
     Financial Services revenue increased   $11 million  , or   8.8%  , in the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 26, 2015  , and   $39 million  , or   10.5%  , in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The increases in Financial Services revenue were primarily due to increases in interest and fee income and interchange income. The increases in interest and fee income were primarily due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate, and the increases in interchange income were primarily due to increases in credit card purchases. Partially offsetting these increases were increases in the provision for loan losses and interest expense. The increases to the provision for loan losses of $16 million and $42 million comparing the respective three and nine periods were due to increases in loan delinquencies and, to a lesser extent, growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans. The increases in interest expense were due to increases to debt as a result of financing the growth of receivables and liquidity needs. 
  Merchandise gross profit decreased   $15 million   and   $9 million  , or   5.3%   and   1.2%  , respectively, in the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to an aggressive pricing, promotion, and markdown strategy. 
  Merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales   decreased     420   basis points to   31.4%   in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , and 270 basis points to   32.2%   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The decreases in the 2016 periods compared to the respective 2015 periods were primarily due to an aggressive pricing, promotion, and markdown strategy, as well as an effort to right size inventory levels in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , which had an impact of approximately 330 basis points and 200 basis points comparing the respective periods, and increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories, which had an impact of approximately 90 basis points and 70 basis points comparing the respective periods.  
    
  The following discussions related to selling, distribution, and administrative ( SD A ) expenses; impairment and restructuring charges; operating income; and operating income of the Merchandising segment are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and as non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. In light of the nature and magnitude, we believe these items should be presented separately to enhance a reader s overall understanding of the Company s ongoing operations. These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. 

36 

Accordingly, to supplement the following discussions related to SD A expenses; SD A expenses as a percentage of total revenue; impairment and restructuring charges; operating income; operating income as a percentage of total revenue; operating income of the Merchandising segment; and operating income of the Merchandising segment as a percentage of total Merchandising segment revenue presented in accordance with GAAP, we are providing non-GAAP adjusted financial measures of operating results that exclude certain items, which are presented below both as GAAP reported and non-GAAP financial measures excluding:  
             
    consulting fees and certain expenses primarily related to our corporate restructuring initiatives and the review of strategic alternatives totaling $12 million for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and $20 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  ;  
                
    a charge recognized on a preliminary settlement totaling $4 million relating to a lawsuit in California state court (a  preliminary lawsuit settlement ) for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  ; 
                 
    a penalty of $1 million associated with the Company s settlement with the SEC for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  ; and  
                
    incremental expenses of $1 million related to the transition and closing of the Company s distribution center in Canada in the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
       
  We believe these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. In addition, we evaluate results using non-GAAP adjusted operating income. These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  The following table reconciles these financial measures to the related GAAP adjusted financial measures for the periods presented. 

37 

(1) 
    The presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.  
              (2) 
    Consists of the following for the respective periods:

SD A expenses increased   $23 million   in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to a net increase in costs totaling $8 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives and the review of strategic alternatives in the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , as well as additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas. Although operating expenses increased   $23 million   comparing the respective periods, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 20 basis points as a result of our expense and process improvement initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses, as reflected in the table above entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  SD A expenses increased   $16 million   comparing the respective periods, and as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 90 basis points in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  .     
    
  SD A expenses   increased     $46 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to a net increase in costs totaling $20 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives, the review of strategic alternatives, and a charge recognized on a preliminary lawsuit settlement in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , as well as additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas. Although operating expenses   increased     $46 million   comparing the respective periods, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue   decreased   100 basis points as a result of our expense and process improvement initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses, as reflected in the table above entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  SD A expenses increased   $28 million   comparing the respective periods, and as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 170 basis points in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
    
  Impairment and restructuring charges decreased $4 million in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , and were basically flat comparing the respective   nine   month periods. The decrease in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , was primarily due to the $5 million charge for severance and related benefits due to our corporate restructuring and reduction in the number of personnel recorded in the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
    
  In the second half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company s operating expense base to increase our return on invested capital. We have identified numerous meaningful savings opportunities across the Company, including information technology process improvement, indirect procurement, retail labor optimization, merchandise sourcing, retail support functions, and supply chain enhancements, some of which we have already implemented. Such opportunities are expected to result in a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue of up to 150 basis points over the next three years. As we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project, we plan to continue our omni-channel initiatives, our Cabela s branded product investments, and our retail expansion. We will continue to manage our operating costs accordingly through fiscal year 2016 and beyond.       
    
  Operating income decreased   $24 million   and   $20 million   in the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 300 basis points and 120 basis points over the respective   three   and nine month periods. The decreases in operating income were primarily attributable to decreases in our merchandise gross profit and increases in consolidated operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses and charges, as reflected in the table above entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  operating income decreased   $21 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, and operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 270 and 60 basis points, respectively, comparing the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
    
  The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments. For a more detailed discussion, see  Results of Operations -   Three Months Ended     October 1, 2016  , Compared to   September 26, 2015    and  Results of Operations -   Nine Months Ended     October 1, 2016  , Compared to   September 26, 2015  .

Our Merchandising segment business is seasonal in nature and interim results may not be indicative of results for the full year. Due to buying patterns around the holidays and the opening of hunting seasons, our merchandise revenue is traditionally higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters, and we typically earn a disproportionate share of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Because of our retail store expansion, and fixed costs associated with retail stores, our quarterly operating income may be further impacted by these seasonal fluctuations. Comparing Merchandising segment results in the three and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  : 
              
    operating income decreased   $30 million   and   $42 million  , respectively; and  
                
    operating income as a percentage of Merchandising segment revenue decreased 370 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively. 
     On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses and charges as reflected in the table above entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  the Merchandising segment operating income decreased $27 million, to   $16 million  , comparing the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , and decreased $24 million, to   $33 million  , comparing the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . On a non-GAAP basis, operating income as a percentage of Merchandising segment revenue decreased 350 basis points, to   1.8%  , and 120 basis points, to   1.4%  , comparing the respective   three   and   nine   month periods. 
  Cabela s CLUB continues to manage its credit card delinquencies and charge-offs through active account management. Comparing Cabela s CLUB results in the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  : 
             
    the average number of active accounts increased   6.8%   and   7.2%  , to   2.1 million   and   2.0 million  , respectively, and the average balance per active account increased   $178   and   $172  , respectively;  
                  
    net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased 51 and   52   basis points, to 2.21% and   2.20%  , respectively. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Financial Services segment issued $497 million in certificates of deposit, completed a term securitization totaling $1.0 billion, and increased two variable funding facilities from   $300 million   and $500 million to   $800 million   and $700 million, respectively, and extended the maturity dates from March 2016 and March 2017 to March 2019 and September 2019, respectively.

Product Sales Mix     The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Merchandising segment for the   three   months ended: 

Merchandise sales increased   $57 million  , or   7.2%  , in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to increases in revenue from the addition of new retail stores of   $63 million   and Internet and catalog sales of   $6 million  , partially offset by a decrease of   $14 million   in comparable store sales.  

42 

Comparable store sales and analysis, calculated on a shift-adjusted calendar basis, are presented below for the   three   months ended:   

  The net decrease in comparable store sales of   $14 million   was due to decreases of $14 million in the clothing and footwear product category and $3 million in the general outdoors product category, partially offset by a $3 million increase in the hunting equipment product category. The decrease in comparable store sales on a consolidated basis comparing the respective periods was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 4.3%, partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 2.7%. 
  Internet and catalog sales increased   $6 million  , or   3.6%  , to   $167 million  , in the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 26, 2015  . The net increase was primarily due to increases of approximately $7 million in the hunting equipment product category and $1 million in the general outdoors product category, partially offset by a $2 million decrease in the clothing and footwear product category. 
   
  Financial Services Revenue     The following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue for the   three   months ended:

The   increase   in interest and fee income of   $30 million   was due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate. The increase in the provision for loan losses of $16 million was due to increases in loan delinquencies. The increase in interest expense of $5 million was due to increases in debt as a result of financing the growth of receivables and liquidity needs. The   increase  s in interchange income and customer rewards costs of   $3 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, were due to increases in credit card purchases.

Key statistics reflecting the performance of Cabela s CLUB are shown in the following chart for the   three   months ended: 

The average balance of credit card loans increased to   $5.2 billion  , or   14.8%  , for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , due to an increase in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month. The average number of active accounts increased to   2.1 million  , or   6.8%  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to   2.21%   for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , up 51 basis points compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to increases in delinquencies. Net charge-offs were also impacted by an increase in the average balance of credit card loans.

Merchandise Gross Profit     
    
  Comparisons and analysis of our merchandise gross profit on merchandise sales are presented below for the   three   months ended:     

Merchandise gross profit decreased   $15 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $269 million   in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to an aggressive pricing, promotion, and markdown strategy. Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales   decreased     420   basis points to   31.4%   in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to an aggressive pricing, promotion, and markdown strategy, as well as an effort to right size inventory levels in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , which had an impact of approximately 330 basis points, and increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories, which had an impact of approximately 90 basis points.  

Selling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses         
    
  Comparisons and analysis of our SD A expenses are presented below for the   three   months ended:

SD A expenses increased primarily due to an increase in costs totaling $8 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives and the review of strategic alternatives in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , as well as additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas.  
  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses, as reflected in the table in the Executive Overview section of this report entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  SD A expenses increased   $16 million   comparing the respective periods, and as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 90 basis points in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
  In addition, in the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , we incurred charges totaling   $1 million   and $5 million, respectively, for severance and related benefits (which were included in impairment and restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of income) primarily attributable to our corporate restructuring and reduction in the number of personnel. These charges for both periods were recognized in the Merchandising segment.

    An increase of $8 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives and the review of strategic alternatives. 
                
    An increase of $4 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation. 
                
    An increase of $4 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores and corporate offices. 
       
  Financial Services Segment:    
             
    An increase of $4 million in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to increases in contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. 
       
  Impairment and Restructuring Charges  
    
  In the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and September 26, 2015, we recognized impairment losses and incurred restructuring charges totaling   $1 million   and   $5 million  , respectively.

The net decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to decreases in our merchandise gross profit and increases in consolidated operating expenses. 
    
  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain expenses and charges, as reflected in the table in the Executive Overview section of this report entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  operating income decreased   $21 million  , and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 270 basis points, comparing the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   three   months ended   September 26, 2015  .

Our effective tax rate increased comparing the respective periods primarily due to increases in nondeductible expenses, tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions, and state income taxes and a decrease in research and development tax credits received.

Product Sales Mix     The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise sales contributed by major product categories for our Merchandising segment for the   nine   months ended: 

Merchandise sales increased   $160 million  , or   7.3%  , in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to an increase of   $198 million   in revenue from the addition of new retail stores partially offset by decreases of   $27 million   in comparable store sales and   $7 million   in Internet and catalog sales.  
  Comparable store sales and analysis, calculated on a shift-adjusted calendar basis, are presented below for the   nine   months ended:   

  The net decrease in comparable store sales of   $27 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , was due to decreases of approximately $36 million in the clothing and footwear product category and $4 million in the general outdoors product category, partially offset by a $13 million increase in the hunting equipment product category. The decrease in comparable store sales on a consolidated basis comparing the respective periods was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.8%, partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 6.2%. In response to the softness of sales in our clothing and footwear categories, we have taken a number of actions, including testing national brand shops in a number of stores, testing alternate labor strategies in our apparel areas aimed at providing better sales coverage during peak selling times, and focusing more on marketing the  better category  selection of our merchandise assortments. 
  For fiscal year 2016, we are continuing to monitor and take steps that are needed to respond to a number of consumer-related factors that may impact our planned growth in comparable store sales on an annual basis. These steps include the timing of discounts offered and promotional events to meet consumer preferences or actions taken by our competitors, including demand for firearms and ammunition, which can be very volatile based on current events as well as potential future government regulation  .   In addition, we are looking at our strategic space allocation and improving space utilization within our stores, as well as changing, as needed in certain locations, our brand assortment between national brands and Cabela s brand. We also are working closely with our vendors and actively managing our inventory levels to ensure that we have the adequate quantity and assortment of necessary products available to meet any such consumer-related factors.

Internet and catalog sales decreased   $7 million  , or   1.6%  , to   $464 million  , in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $14 million in the clothing and footwear product category, partially offset by increases of $4 million in the hunting equipment product category and $3 million in the general outdoors product category.

The increase in interest and fee income of   $86 million   was primarily due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate. The increases in interchange income and customer rewards costs of   $17 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, were due to increases in credit card purchases. The increase in the provision for loan losses of   $42 million   was due to increases in loan delinquencies and, to a lesser extent, growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans. The increase in interest expense of $13 million was due to increases in debt as a result of financing the growth of receivables and liquidity needs.

We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month. The average number of active accounts increased to   2.0 million  , or   7.2%  , in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions.

Net charge-offs were also impacted by an increase in the average balance of credit card loans. See  Asset Quality of Cabela s CLUB  in this report for additional information on trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans and analysis of our allowance for loan losses.

This decrease was primarily due to an aggressive pricing, promotion, and markdown strategy, which had an impact of approximately 200 basis points, and increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories, which had an impact of approximately 70 basis points.

SD A expenses increased primarily due to an increase in costs totaling $20 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives, the review of strategic alternatives, and a charge recognized on a preliminary lawsuit settlement in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , as well as additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas.  
  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain costs, as reflected in the table in the Executive Overview section of this report entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  SD A expenses increased   $28 million   comparing the respective periods, and as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 170 basis points in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .

These charges for both periods were recognized in the Merchandising segment.      
  The most significant changes in SD A expenses in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , related to specific business segments, included:

    An increase of $16 million related to corporate restructuring initiatives and the review of strategic alternatives. 
                
    An increase of $13 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores and corporate offices. 
                
    An increase of $4 million related to a charge recognized on a preliminary lawsuit settlement. 
                
    A decrease of $3 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to our corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company s operating expenses and a reduction in incentive compensation. 
       
  Financial Services Segment:    
             
    An increase of $10 million in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to increases in contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. 
       
  Impairment and Restructuring Charges 
  In the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and September 26, 2015, we recognized impairment losses and incurred restructuring charges totaling   $5 million   and   $6 million  , respectively.

The net decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to decreases in our merchandise gross profit and increases in consolidated operating expenses. 
  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of certain costs and charges, as reflected in the table in the Executive Overview section of this report entitled  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures,  operating income decreased   $2 million  , and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 60 basis points, comparing the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . 
  Under an Intercompany Agreement, described more fully in Note 14  Segment Reporting  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Financial Services segment pays a license fee to the Merchandising segment and, among other items, reimburses the Merchandising segment for certain promotional costs. Total fees paid under this Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to the Merchandising segment increased $8 million in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the issuances of the new unsecured notes for $250 million in August 2015 and $300 million in December 2015. The amount of interest capitalized   decreased     $6 million   comparing the respective periods due to a slowdown in new store activity and interest that was capitalized in 2015 for our new corporate facility and distribution center in Tooele, Utah. 

Other Non-Operating Income, Net 
  Other non-operating income was   $5 million   in both the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  .

Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies. Net charge-offs were also impacted by an increase in the average balance of credit card loans.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     Overview 
  Our Merchandising segment and our Financial Services segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs. We believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand, our revolving credit facility, and other borrowing sources to fund our cash requirements and near-term growth plans for at least the next 12 months. At   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , cash on a consolidated basis totaled   $137 million  ,   $315 million  , and   $83 million  , respectively, of which   $94 million  ,   $157 million  , and   $45 million  , respectively, was cash at the Financial Services segment which is utilized to meet this segment s liquidity requirements. We evaluate the credit markets for securitizations and certificates of deposit to determine the most cost effective source of funds for the Financial Services segment. During 2016, the Financial Services segment has issued certificates of deposit and a term securitization as well as utilized variable funding facilities. In the final quarter of 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to utilize variable funding facilities. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment s cash requirements, including maturities and near-term growth plans.  
  Merchandising Segment     Our credit agreement provides for an unsecured   $775 million   revolving credit facility and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to   $75 million   and swing line loans up to   $30 million  . The credit facility may be increased to   $800 million   subject to certain terms and conditions. The term of the credit facility expires on June 18, 2019. Advances under the credit facility will be used for the Company s general business purposes, including working capital support. 

54 

Our unsecured   $775 million   revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage, a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum consolidated net worth standard. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured senior notes through at least the next 12 months. 
  We have an unsecured   $20 million   Canadian ( CAD ) revolving credit facility for our operations in Canada. Borrowings are payable on demand with interest payable monthly. The credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $10 million CAD in the aggregate, which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility. 
  On September 1, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock over a two-year period. This authorization is in addition to the standing annual authorization to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from equity-based awards issued under the Company s equity compensation plans. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time  .   We did not engage in any stock repurchase activity in the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016  . As of   October 1, 2016  , up to   $426 million   of authorization to repurchase our common stock remained under this program. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company generally may not repurchase shares of its common stock, except in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or the settlement of restricted stock unit awards. As a result, the Company does not anticipate repurchasing any further shares under this program. 
  Financial Services Segment     We have been, and will continue to be, particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for the Financial Services segment. A failure to renew existing variable funding facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of the Financial Services segment. Unfavorable conditions in the asset-backed securities markets generally, including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements, could have a similar effect.  
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Financial Services segment issued $497 million in certificates of deposit, completed a term securitization totaling $1.0 billion, and increased two variable funding facilities from   $300 million   and $500 million to   $800 million   and $700 million, respectively, and extended the maturity dates from March 2016 and March 2017 to March 2019 and September 2019, respectively. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment s foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities and near-term growth plans. 

55 

The total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of   October 1, 2016  , were as follows:  

The securitized credit card loans of the Financial Services segment could experience poor performance, including increased delinquencies and credit losses, lower payment rates, or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds. This could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in the Financial Services segment s securitization transactions, cause early amortization of these securities, or result in higher required credit enhancement levels. Credit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  .   
    
  The Financial Services segment utilizes brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities. At   October 1, 2016  , the Financial Services segment had   $1.2 billion   of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from   October 2016   to   July 2023   and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of   1.92%  . This outstanding balance compares to   $880 million   and   $888 million   at   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, with weighted average effective annual fixed rates of   2.23%   and   2.22%  , respectively.

Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities 
  The following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the   nine   months ended:  

2016 versus 2015     
    
  Operating Activities     Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $228 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to a net change of   $142 million   in inventories, and net increases of   $72 million   related to income taxes and $42 million in the provision for loan losses. Inventory levels totaled $997 million at October 1, 2016, compared to $1.1 billion at September 26, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases to operating activities was a   $31 million   decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a net decrease of $16 million in other long-term liabilities. 
    
  Investing Activities     Cash used in investing activities increased   $435 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to a net change of $606 million in restricted cash of the Trust, which was used to repay $255 million of Series 2010-I notes in full on January 15, 2015, and a decrease in cash of   $45 million   related to our credit card loan activity from outside sources. Cash paid for property and equipment totaled   $126 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $342 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company estimated it had total cash commitments of approximately   $109 million   outstanding for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures over the next 12 months with cash generated from operations and borrowings.  
    
  Financing Activities     Cash provided by financing activities increased   $79 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , primarily due to net increases of   $259 million   in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment and $215 million in time deposits. In addition, in the nine months ended   September 26, 2015  , we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $108 million. We did not engage in any stock repurchase activity in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease related to a repayment of our $215 million unsecured debt in February 2016 and   $32 million   decrease in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities. Also, on August 4, 2015, we issued and sold under a note purchase agreement $250 million of senior unsecured notes. 
  The following table presents the borrowing activities of our merchandising business and the Financial Services segment for the   nine   months ended:    

57 

The following table summarizes our availability under the Company s debt and credit facilities, excluding the facilities of the Financial Services segment, at the periods ended:    

We also have an unsecured   $20 million   CAD credit facility with an outstanding balance of $4 million at   October 1, 2016  , and no amount outstanding at   September 26, 2015  . The Financial Services segment also has total borrowing availability of   $100 million   under its agreements to borrow federal funds. At   October 1, 2016  , the entire   $100 million   of borrowing capacity was available.  
    
  The following table provides summary information concerning other commercial commitments at   October 1, 2016  :  

(1) 
    Our credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $75 million and swing line loans up to $30 million.  
              (2) 
    The line of credit for boat and all-terrain vehicles financing is limited by the $775 million revolving line of credit to $75 million of secured collateral. 
     Our   $775 million   unsecured credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other customary covenants, including: 
             
    a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of no less than 2.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters (as defined); 
                
    a leverage ratio (as defined) of no more than 3.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and 
                
    a minimum consolidated net worth standard (as defined) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. 
       
  In addition, our unsecured senior notes contain various covenants and restrictions that are usual and customary for transactions of this type. Also, the debt agreements contain cross default provisions to other outstanding credit facilities. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured senior notes through at least the next 12 months. 

58 

Economic Development Bonds and Grants         
  Economic Development Bonds     At   October 1, 2016  ,   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , economic development bonds totaled   $85 million  ,   $84 million  , and   $81 million  , respectively. On a quarterly basis, we perform various procedures to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds. For the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , there were   no   other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and   no   adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds. However, at   October 1, 2016  , we identified economic development bonds totaling $21 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds.      
    
  Grants     At   October 1, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was   $42 million   and   $43 million  , respectively. At   October 1, 2016  , we had recorded   $17 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants with   $16 million   in current liabilities and   $1 million   in long-term liabilities. At   January 2, 2016  , and   September 26, 2015  , the amount the Company had recorded in current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants was   $17 million  , and   $23 million  , respectively. 
    
  Impact of Inflation 
    
  We do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years. We cannot assure, however, that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future.   
    
  In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. For a description of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of   January 2, 2016  , see our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending   January 2, 2016  , under  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments.  
    
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Operating Leases     We lease various items of office equipment and buildings. Rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income.  
    
  Credit Card Limits     The Financial Services segment bears off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business. One form of this risk is through the Financial Services segment s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits. The aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled   $36 billion   above existing balances at the end of   October 1, 2016  . These funding obligations are not included on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. While the Financial Services segment has not experienced, and does not anticipate that it will experience, a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders, such an event would create a cash need at the Financial Services segment which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources. The Financial Services segment has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time.  

59 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
  We are exposed to interest rate risk through the operations of the Financial Services segment, and, to a lesser extent, through our merchandising operations. We also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations.   
    
  There were no material changes to our exposures to our market risks in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures         
       
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  In connection with this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated, with the participation of our management, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 1, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
    
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings.     
       
  For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9  Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Claims  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
    
           Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors.     
     The following description of risk factors supplements the risk factors regarding what the Company previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  , filed with the SEC on February 22, 2016, and in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2016, filed with the SEC on April 28, 2016.  Other than as expressly set forth herein, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed. 
  The announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger and the related Bank Transaction (the  Transactions ) may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Transactions on our employees, customers, and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation regardless of whether the Transactions are completed. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the proposed Transactions: 

the impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, including key personnel; 
                
    the diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the proposed Transactions; 
                
    difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners; 
                
    delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers, and other business partners; 
                
    the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because of requirements in the Merger Agreement and the Bank Purchase Agreement that we conduct our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the proposed Transactions; 
                
    litigation relating to the proposed Transactions and the costs related thereto; and 
                
    the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Transactions. 
       
  Failure to consummate the proposed Transactions within the expected timeframe or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
   There can be no assurance that the proposed Transactions will occur. Consummation of the Merger is subject to specified conditions, including: (i) the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon; (ii) the consummation of the purchase and sale of the banking business of the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, World s Foremost Bank, a Nebraska banking corporation, in accordance with the Bank Purchase Agreement and merger of World s Foremost Bank into the Company or another subsidiary of the Company and termination of its bank charter; (iii) any applicable waiting periods (or extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 having expired or been terminated; (iv) the absence of any order by any governmental entity rendering the Merger illegal, or prohibiting, enjoining or otherwise preventing the Merger; and (v) other customary closing conditions.  
  
   61 

The Bank Transaction is also subject to a variety of closing conditions, including: (i) the filing of required notices and the obtainment of required consents from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance; (ii) the absence of any order prohibiting or making illegal the transactions; (iii) the continued effectiveness of the associated Bank Program Agreement; (iv) the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (v) in the case of Capital One, the absence of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition (as defined in the Bank Purchase Agreement); (vi) receipt of written notice from each of S P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and DBRS, Inc. that the transaction described in the Bank Purchase Agreement and related transaction documents will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of its then-existing rating with respect to any outstanding series or class with respect to which it is a rating agency; (vii) termination of each outstanding series of variable funding notes issued by Cabela s Credit Card Master Note Trust; (viii) the receipt of legal and tax opinions and other customary documentation required in connection with the transfer of securitization vehicles; and (ix) customary closing conditions. 
  There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. 
  The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both us and Bass Pro Group, and in certain specified circumstances upon termination of the Merger Agreement we would be required to pay Bass Pro Group a termination fee of $126 million. The Bank Purchase Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both us and Capital One, and in certain circumstances we would be required to pay Capital One a termination fee of $14 million. If we are required to make these payments, doing so may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  There can be no assurance that a remedy will be available to us in the event of a breach of the Merger Agreement by Bass Pro Group or the Bank Purchase Agreement by Capital One. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transactions, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if the Transactions are not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of $65.50 per share or higher, on terms acceptable to us, the share price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Transactions will be completed. Also, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Transactions, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Transactions are not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Transactions are not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Transactions. 
   
           Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.     
     We did not engage in any stock repurchase activity in any of the three fiscal months in the third fiscal quarter ended   October 1, 2016  . As of   October 1, 2016  , up to   $426 million   of authorization to repurchase our common stock remained under the Company s $500 million share repurchase program announced on September 1, 2015. This share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any outstanding shares of its common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time  .   Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company generally may not repurchase shares of its common stock, except in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or the settlement of restricted stock unit awards. As a result, the Company does not anticipate repurchasing any further shares under this program.

 EXHIBIT 31.1

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31.1 
    
  CERTIFICATION 
    
  I, Thomas L. Millner, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Cabela's Incorporated; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors: 
       
           a.

           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b.

           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors:

           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
