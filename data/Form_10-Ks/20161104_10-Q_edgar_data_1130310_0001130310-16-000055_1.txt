CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
    
  From time to time we make statements concerning our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. You can generally identify our forward-looking statements by the words  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   goal,   intend,   may,   objective,   plan,   potential,   predict,   projection,   should,   will  or other similar words. 
    
  We have based our forward-looking statements on our management s beliefs and assumptions based on information reasonably available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may and often do vary materially from actual results. Therefore, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. 
    
  The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements: 

the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable, Enable s ability to redeem the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances and the value of our interest in Enable, and factors that may have a material impact on such performance, cash distributions and value, including factors such as: 

competitive conditions in the midstream industry, and actions taken by Enable s customers and competitors, including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Enable;  

the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas and associated commodity prices, particularly prices of natural gas and NGLs, the competitive effects of the available pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable, and the effects of geographic and seasonal commodity price differentials, including the effects of these circumstances on re-contracting available capacity on Enable s interstate pipelines; 

the demand for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and transportation and storage services;  

environmental and other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing;

timely and appropriate rate actions that allow recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; 

industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territories and changes in market demand, including the effects of energy efficiency measures and demographic patterns; 

future economic conditions in regional and national markets and their effect on sales, prices and costs;  

weather variations and other natural phenomena, including the impact of severe weather events on operations and capital; 

our ability to mitigate weather impacts through normalization or rate mechanisms, and the effectiveness of such mechanisms; 

the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas, and the effects of geographic and seasonal commodity price differentials  ; 

problems with regulatory approval, construction, implementation of necessary technology or other issues with respect to major capital projects that result in delays or in cost overruns that cannot be recouped in rates; 

local, state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change; 

the impact of unplanned facility outages; 
     
    iv 

any direct or indirect effects on our facilities, operations and financial condition resulting from terrorism, cyber-attacks, data security breaches or other attempts to disrupt our businesses or the businesses of third parties, or other catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events or other occurrences; 

our ability to invest planned capital and the timely recovery of our investment in capital; 

our ability to control operation and maintenance costs; 

actions by credit rating agencies; 

the sufficiency of our insurance coverage, including availability, cost, coverage and terms; 

the investment performance of our pension and postretirement benefit plans; 

commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets;

acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; 

our or Enable s ability to recruit, effectively transition and retain management and key employees and maintain good labor relations; 

the ability of GenOn (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy and RRI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or obligations in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; 

the outcome of litigation;

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1)     Background and Basis of Presentation    
    
  General.   Included in this Form 10-Q are the Interim Condensed Financial Statements of CenterPoint Energy. The Interim Condensed Financial Statements are unaudited, omit certain financial statement disclosures and should be read with the 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Background.   CenterPoint Energy, Inc. is a public utility holding company. CenterPoint Energy s operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas distribution facilities, and both CenterPoint Energy and its operating subsidiaries own interests in Enable as described in   Note 8  . As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy s indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries included: 

Houston Electric, which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston; and 

CERC Corp. (together with its subsidiaries), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems.  A wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CERC Corp. also owned approximately   55.4%   of the limited partner interests in Enable, which owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.   
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy had VIEs consisting of Bond Companies, which it consolidates. The consolidated VIEs are wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities that were formed specifically for the purpose of securitizing transition and system restoration-related property. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Bond Companies. The bonds issued by these VIEs are payable only from and secured by transition and system restoration property, and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of CenterPoint Energy. 
    
  Basis of Presentation.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy s Interim Condensed Financial Statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods. Amounts reported in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for a full-year period due to the effects of, among other things, (a) seasonal fluctuations in demand for energy and energy services, (b) changes in energy commodity prices, (c) timing of maintenance and other expenditures and (d) acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, assets and other interests. 
    
  For a description of CenterPoint Energy s reportable business segments, see   Note 16  . 

(2)     New Accounting Pronouncements    
    
  In   February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation   Analysis   (ASU 2015-02). ASU 2015  -02 changes the analysis that reporting organizations must perform to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities, such as limited partnerships.   The changes include, among others, modification of the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities and elimination of the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. ASU 2015-02 does not amend the related party guidance for situations in which power is shared between two or more entities that hold interests in a VIE. CenterPoint Energy adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which CenterPoint Energy determined did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost   (ASU 2015-03)  .    ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU 2015-03. CenterPoint Energy adopted ASU 2015-03 retrospectively on January 1, 2016, which resulted in a reduction of other long-term assets, indexed debt  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

and total long-term debt on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. CenterPoint Energy had debt issuance costs, excluding amounts related to credit facility arrangements, of   $44 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)   (ASU 2015-07). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are measured at NAV using the practical expedient. Entities will be required to disclose the fair value of investments measured using the NAV practical expedient so that financial statement users can reconcile amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy table to amounts reported on the balance sheet. CenterPoint Energy adopted ASU 2015-07 on January 1, 2016, which will have an impact on its employee benefit plan disclosures, beginning with its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. This standard did not have an impact on CenterPoint Energy s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   (ASU 2015-16).  ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer would recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which the amount of the adjustment is determined. CenterPoint Energy adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   (ASU 2016-01). ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value and to recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicability exception. It does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-01 also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects related to recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. CenterPoint Energy is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 provides a comprehensive new lease model that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases and would change certain aspects of lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018,   with early adoption permitted.   CenterPoint Energy is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novation on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   (ASU 2016-05). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument or a change in a critical term of the hedging relationship. This clarification applies to both cash flow and fair value hedging relationships. CenterPoint Energy adopted ASU 2016-05 prospectively in the first quarter of 2016, which did not have an impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures. 
    
  In March, April, and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations   (ASU 2016-08), ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   (ASU 2016-10), and ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   (ASU 2016-12), respectively. ASU 2016-08,  ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 clarify certain aspects of ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. CenterPoint Energy is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, and ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures and expects to adopt these ASUs on January 1, 2018. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09).  ASU 2016-09 will change the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including the recognition of income tax effects of vested or settled awards in the income statement, instead of within additional paid-in capital. It will also increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligations. ASU 2016-09 will allow companies to elect between two different methods to account for forfeitures of share-based payments. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016,   with early adoption permitted.   CenterPoint Energy does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires a new model called the CECL model to estimate credit losses for financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, loan commitments, financial guarantees, and net investments in leases, as well as reinsurance and trade receivables. Upon initial recognition of the exposure, the CECL model requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure based on historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The update also amends the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2018. CenterPoint Energy is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)-Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15   provides clarifying guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and eliminates the variation in practice related to such classifications. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. CenterPoint Energy is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its statement of cash flows. 
    
  Management believes that other recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on CenterPoint Energy s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. 

(3)     Acquisition    
    
  On April 1, 2016,     CES, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, closed the previously announced agreement to acquire the retail energy services business and natural gas wholesale assets of Continuum for a preliminary purchase price of   $98 million  , including working capital.  After working capital adjustments, the final purchase price was   $102 million   and allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.  
    
  The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation and the fair value amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition:

    22 
      
      Net assets acquired 
      
    $ 
    102 

The goodwill of   $22 million   resulting from the acquisition reflects the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.  The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition primarily reflects the value of th  e complementary operational and geographic footprints, along with the scale, geographic reach and expanded capabilities.  
    
  Identifiable intangible assets were recorded at estimated fair value as determined by management based on available information, which includes a valuation prepared by an independent third party.  The significant assumptions used in arriving at the estimated identifiable intangible asset values included management s estimates of future cash flows, the discount rate which is based on the weighted average cost of capital for comparable publicly traded guideline companies and projected customer attrition rates. The useful lives for the identifiable intangible assets were determined using methods that approximate the pattern of economic benefit provided by the utilization of the assets.

Amortization expense related to the above identifiable intangible assets was   $1 million   and   $2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Revenues of approximately   $170 million   and   $270 million  , respectively, and operating income of approximately   $2 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, attributable to the acquisition are included in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  As Continuum was a non-public company that did not prepare interim financial information and the acquisition included the purchase of both businesses and assets, the historical financial information for the businesses and assets acquired was impracticable to obtain. As a result, pro forma results of the acquired businesses and assets are not presented. 

(4)     Employee Benefit Plans    
    
  CenterPoint Energy s net periodic cost includes the following components relating to pension and postretirement benefits: 

(1) 
    Net periodic cost in these tables is before considering amounts subject to overhead allocations for capital expenditure projects or for amounts subject to deferral for regulatory purposes.   
       
           (2) 
    A one-time, non-cash settlement charge is required when lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic cost for that year.  Due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the non-qualified pension plan during the three and nine months  
     
   9 

     Table of Contents  

ended   September 30, 2015  , CenterPoint Energy recognized a non-cash settlement charge of   $1 million   and   $10 million  , respectively.  This charge is an acceleration of costs that would otherwise be recognized in future periods.   
    
           (3) 
    A curtailment gain or loss is required when the expected future services of a significant number of current employees are reduced or eliminated for the accrual of benefits. In May 2016, Houston Electric entered into a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW Local Union 66 that provides that for Houston Electric union employees covered under the agreement who retire on or after January 1, 2017, retiree medical and prescription drug coverage will be provided exclusively through the NECA/IBEW Family Medical Care Plan in exchange for the payment of monthly premiums as determined under the agreement.  As a result, the accrued postretirement benefits related to such future Houston Electric union retirees were eliminated. Houston Electric recognized a curtailment gain of   $3 million   as an accelerated recognition of the prior service credit that would otherwise be recognized in future periods.  
       
  CenterPoint Energy s changes in accumulated comprehensive loss related to defined benefit and postretirement plans are as follows: 

(1) 
    Total other comprehensive income (loss) related to the remeasurement of the postretirement plan.   
       
           (2) 
    These accumulated other comprehensive components are included in the computation of net periodic cost. 
       
  CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a total of approximately   $8 million   to its pension plans in   2016  , of which approximately   $2 million   and   $7 million   were contributed during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a total of approximately   $16 million   to its postretirement benefit plan in   2016  , of which approximately   $4 million   and   $12 million   were contributed during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

(5)     Regulatory Accounting    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Houston Electric has not recognized an allowed equity return of   $341 million   because such return will be recognized as it is recovered in rates. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Houston Electric recognized approximately   $22 million   and   $16 million  , respectively, of the allowed equity return not previously recognized.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Houston Electric recognized approximately   $52 million   and   $37 million  , respectively, of the allowed equity return not previously recognized.

(6)     Derivative Instruments    
    
  CenterPoint Energy is exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.  CenterPoint Energy utilizes derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on its operating results and cash flows. Such derivatives are recognized in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value unless CenterPoint Energy elects the normal purchase and sales exemption for qualified physical transactions. A derivative may be designated as a normal purchase or sale if the intent is to physically receive or deliver the product for use or sale in the normal course of business. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy has a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate and business segment officers that oversees commodity price, weather and credit risk activities, including CenterPoint Energy s marketing, risk management services and hedging activities. The committee s duties are to establish CenterPoint Energy s commodity risk policies, allocate board-approved commercial risk limits, approve the use of new products and commodities, monitor positions and ensure compliance with CenterPoint Energy s risk management policies, procedures and limits established by CenterPoint Energy s board of directors. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy s policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments. A leveraged financial instrument, for this purpose, is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument. 
    
           (a) 
    Non-Trading Activities 
       
  Derivative Instruments.   CenterPoint Energy enters into certain derivative instruments to manage physical commodity price risk and does not engage in proprietary or speculative commodity trading.  These financial instruments do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. 
    
  Weather Hedges.   CenterPoint Energy has weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that mitigate the impact of weather on NGD in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota and Oklahoma. NGD and electric operations in Texas do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for NGD compared to CenterPoint Energy s other jurisdictions.   As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on NGD s results in Texas and on Houston Electric s results in its service territory. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy has historically entered into heating-degree day swaps for certain NGD jurisdictions to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather on its results of operations and cash flows for the winter heating season, which contained a bilateral dollar cap of   $16 million   in 2014 2015.  However, NGD did not enter into heating-degree day swaps for the 2015 2016 winter season as a result of NGD s Minnesota division implementing a full decoupling pilot in July 2015. CenterPoint Energy  entered into weather hedges for the Houston Electric service territory, which contained bilateral dollar caps of   $8 million  ,   $7 million   and   $9 million   for the 2014 2015, 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 winter seasons, respectively. The swaps are based on   10  -year normal weather. During both the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , CenterPoint Energy recognized   no   gains or losses related to these swaps.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , CenterPoint Energy recognized gains of   $3 million   and losses of   $9 million  , respectively, related to these swaps. Weather hedge gains and losses are included in revenues in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. 
    
  Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt Issuances.   In April 2016, Houston Electric entered into forward interest rate agreements with several counterparties, having an aggregate notional amount of   $150 million  . These agreements were executed to hedge, in part, volatility in the 5-year U.S. treasury rate by reducing Houston Electric s exposure to variability in cash flows related to interest payments of Houston Electric s   $300 million   issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2016. These forward interest rate agreements were designated as cash flow hedges. The realized gains and losses associated with the agreements were immaterial. 
     
  In June and July 2016, Houston Electric entered into forward interest rate agreements with several counterparties, having an aggregate notional amount of   $300 million  . These agreements were executed to hedge, in part, volatility in the 10-year U.S. treasury rate by reducing Houston Electric s exposure to variability in cash flows related to interest payments of Houston Electric s   $300 million   issuance of fixed rate debt in August 2016.  These forward interest rate agreements were designated as cash flow hedges.  Accordingly, the effective portion of realized gains and losses associated with the agreements, which totaled   $1.1 million  , is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the life of the bonds.  The ineffective portion of the gains and losses was recorded in income and was immaterial.

    Credit Risk Contingent Features 
       
  CenterPoint Energy enters into financial derivative contracts containing material adverse change provisions.  These provisions could require CenterPoint Energy to post additional collateral if the S P or Moody s credit ratings of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or its subsidiaries are downgraded.  The total fair value of the derivative instruments that contain credit risk contingent features that are in a net liability position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $2 million   and   $3 million  , respectively.  CenterPoint Energy posted   no   assets as collateral towards derivative instruments that contain credit risk contingent features as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  If all derivative contracts (in a net liability position) containing credit risk contingent features were triggered as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $2 million   of additional assets would be required to be posted as collateral. 

(7)     Fair Value Measurements    
    
  Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined below and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: 
    
  Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities. 
    
  Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets.  A market approach is utilized to value CenterPoint Energy s Level 2 assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.  Unobservable inputs reflect CenterPoint Energy s judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. CenterPoint Energy develops these inputs based on the best information available, including CenterPoint Energy s own data. A market approach is utilized to value CenterPoint Energy s Level 3 assets or liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy s Level 3 assets and liabilities are comprised of physical forward contracts and options.  Level 3 physical forward contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model which includes illiquid forward price curve locations (ranging from   $0.77   to   $7.90   per one million British thermal  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

units) as an unobservable input. Level 3 options are valued through Black-Scholes (including forward start) option models which include option volatilities (ranging from   0%   to   73%  ) as an unobservable input.  CenterPoint Energy s Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of both long and short positions (forwards and options) and their fair value is sensitive to forward prices and volatilities. If forward prices decrease, CenterPoint Energy s long forwards lose value whereas its short forwards gain in value.  If volatility decreases, CenterPoint Energy s long options lose value whereas its short options gain in value. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy determines the appropriate level for each financial asset and liability on a quarterly basis and recognizes transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   transfers between Level 1 and 2.  CenterPoint Energy also recognizes purchases of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at their fair market value at the end of the reporting period.  
    
  The following tables present information about CenterPoint Energy s assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by CenterPoint Energy to determine such fair value.

  The following table presents additional information about assets or liabilities, including derivatives that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which CenterPoint Energy has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value: 

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities classified as  trading  and short-term borrowings are estimated to be approximately equivalent to carrying amounts and have been excluded from the table below. The carrying amounts of non-trading derivative assets and liabilities and CenterPoint Energy s ZENS indexed debt securities derivative are stated at fair value and are excluded from the table below.  The fair value of each debt instrument is determined by multiplying the principal amount of each debt instrument by the market price.  These assets and liabilities, which are not measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets but for which the fair value is disclosed, would be classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

(8)     Unconsolidated Affiliate    
    
   On May 1, 2013 (the Formation Date) CERC Corp., OGE and ArcLight closed on the formation of Enable.  CenterPoint Energy has the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of Enable and, accordingly, accounts for its investment in Enable s common and subordinated units using the equity method of accounting.  
    
  CenterPoint Energy s maximum exposure to loss related to Enable, a VIE in which CenterPoint Energy is not the primary beneficiary, is limited to its equity investment and preferred unit investment as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  , the guarantees discussed in   Note 14  , and outstanding current accounts receivable from Enable.  On February 18, 2016, CenterPoint Energy purchased in a Private Placement an aggregate of   14,520,000   Series A Preferred Units from Enable for a total purchase price of   $363 million  , which is accounted for as a cost method investment.  In connection with  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

the Private Placement, Enable redeemed   $363 million   of notes owed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC Corp., which bore interest at an annual rate of   2.10%   to   2.45%  . CenterPoint Energy recorded interest income of   $-0-   and   $2 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1 million   and   $6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and had interest receivable from Enable of   $-0-   and   $4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, on its notes receivable. 
    
  Effective on the Formation Date, CenterPoint Energy and Enable entered into the Transition Agreements. Under the Services Agreement, CenterPoint Energy agreed to provide certain support services to Enable such as accounting, legal, risk management and treasury functions for an initial term, which ended on April 30, 2016.  CenterPoint Energy is providing certain services to Enable on a year-to-year basis. Enable may terminate (i) the entire Services Agreement with at least   90   days  notice prior to the end of any extension term, or (ii) either any service provided under the Services Agreement, or the entire Services Agreement, at any time upon approval by its board of directors and with at least   180   days  notice. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy billed Enable for reimbursement of transition services of   $1 million   and   $3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6 million   and   $10 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under the Transition Agreements.  Actual transition services costs are recorded net of reimbursements received from Enable.  CenterPoint Energy had accounts receivable from Enable of   $2 million   and   $3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for amounts billed for transition services. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy incurred natural gas expenses, including transportation and storage costs, of   $22 million   and   $23 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $79 million   and   $87 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for transactions with Enable.  CenterPoint Energy had accounts payable to Enable of   $8 million   and   $11 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, from such transactions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy held an approximate   55.4%   limited partner interest in Enable, consisting of    94,151,707   common units and   139,704,916   subordinated units. As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy and OGE each owned a   50%   management interest in the general partner of Enable and a   40%   and   60%   interest, respectively, in the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy held   14,520,000   Series A Preferred Units in Enable. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy evaluates its equity method investments and cost method investments for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in value of its investment has occurred and the carrying amount of its investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of CenterPoint Energy s equity method investment in Enable was   $10.84   per unit, which includes limited partner common and subordinated units, a general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. On   September 30, 2016  , Enable s common unit price closed at   $15.25  .  
    
  As there were no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of CenterPoint Energy s cost method investment in Enable s Series A Preferred Units as of   September 30, 2016  , and the investment s fair value is not readily determinable, an estimate of the fair value of the cost method investment was not performed.

(9)     Goodwill    
    
  Goodwill by reportable business segment as of   December 31, 2015   and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

(1) See Note 3. 
  (2) Amount presented is net of the accumulated goodwill impairment charge of   $252 million  . 
    
  CenterPoint Energy performs its goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluates goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation for goodwill is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets) in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. 
    
  CenterPoint Energy performed its annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2016 and determined, based on the results of the first step, that no impairment charge was required for any reportable segment. 

(10)     Capital Stock    
    
  CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has   1,020,000,000   authorized shares of capital stock, comprised of   1,000,000,000   shares of   $0.01   par value common stock and   20,000,000   shares of   $0.01   par value cumulative preferred stock. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   430,682,021   shares of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. common stock were issued and   430,681,855   shares were outstanding. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   430,262,869   shares of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. common stock were issued and   430,262,703   shares were outstanding.

(11)     Indexed Debt Securities (ZENS) and Securities Related to ZENS    
    
  (a) Investment in Securities Related to ZENS 
    
  In 1995, CenterPoint Energy sold a cable television subsidiary to TW and received TW securities as partial consideration. A subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy now holds   7.1 million   shares of TW Common,   0.9 million   shares of Time Common and   0.9 million   shares of Charter Common, which are classified as trading securities and are expected to be held to facilitate CenterPoint Energy s ability to meet its obligation under the ZENS. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value of the TW Securities are recorded in CenterPoint Energy s Statements of Consolidated Income. 
    
  (b) ZENS 
    
  In September 1999, CenterPoint Energy issued ZENS having an original principal amount of   $1 billion   of which   $828 million   remain outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to   95%   of the market value of the reference shares of TW Common attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events.  Prior to the merger described below, the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of   0.5   share of TW Common,   0.125505   share of TWC Common and   0.0625   share of Time Common.

     Table of Contents  

On May 26, 2015, Charter announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with TWC.  On September 21, 2015, Charter shareholders approved the announced transaction with TWC.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon closing of the merger, TWC Common would be exchanged for cash and Charter Common and as a result, reference shares for the ZENS would consist of Charter Common, TW Common and Time Common. The merger closed on May 18, 2016.  CenterPoint Energy received   $100   and   0.4891   shares of Charter Common for each share of TWC Common held, resulting in cash proceeds of   $178 million   and   872,531   shares of Charter Common.  In accordance with the terms of the ZENS, CenterPoint Energy remitted   $178 million   to ZENS note holders in June 2016, which reduced contingent principal.  As a result, CenterPoint Energy recorded the following:

  On October 22, 2016, AT T announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TW in a stock and cash transaction.  Pursuant to the agreement, TW Common would be exchanged for cash and AT T Common, and as a result, reference shares would consist of Charter Common, Time Common and AT T Common. AT T announced that the merger is expected to close by the end of 2017. 

(12)     Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt    
    
           (a) 
    Short-term Borrowings 
       
  Inventory Financing  . NGD has asset management agreements associated with its utility distribution service in Arkansas, north Louisiana and Oklahoma that extend through 2019. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, NGD sells natural gas and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the winter heating seasons at the same cost, plus a financing charge. These transactions are accounted for as a financing and had an associated principal obligation of   $43 million   and   $40 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
           (b) 
    Long-term Debt 
       
  Debt Repayments.    In May 2016, CERC retired approximately   $325 million   aggregate principal amount of its   6.15%   senior notes at their maturity.  The retirement of senior notes was financed by the issuance of commercial paper.   
    
  Houston Electric General Mortgage Bonds.    In May 2016, Houston Electric issued   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   1.85%   general mortgage bonds due 2021.  In August 2016, Houston Electric issued   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.40%   general mortgage bonds due 2026.  The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Credit Facilities.   On March 4, 2016, CenterPoint Energy announced that it had refinanced its existing   $2.1 billion   revolving credit facilities, which would have expired in 2019, with new revolving credit facilities totaling an aggregate   $2.5 billion  .  The credit agreements evidencing the new revolving credit facilities provide for   five  -year senior unsecured revolving credit facilities in amounts of   $1.6 billion   for CenterPoint Energy,   $300 million   for Houston Electric and   $600 million   for CERC Corp.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC Corp. had the following revolving credit facilities and utilization of such facilities: 

CenterPoint Energy s   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.25%   based on CenterPoint Energy s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits CenterPoint Energy s consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed   65%   of CenterPoint Energy s consolidated capitalization.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy s debt (excluding Securitization Bonds) to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   55.5%  .  The financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from   65%   to   70%   if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and CenterPoint Energy certifies to the administrative agent that Houston Electric has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed   $100 million   in a consecutive   twelve  -month period, all or part of which Houston Electric intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date CenterPoint Energy delivers its certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of CenterPoint Energy s certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. 
    
  Houston Electric s   $300 million   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.125%   based on Houston Electric s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits Houston Electric s consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed   65%   of Houston Electric s consolidated capitalization. As of   September 30, 2016  , Houston Electric s debt (excluding Securitization Bonds) to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   51.7%  .  The financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from   65%   to   70%   if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and Houston Electric certifies to the administrative agent that Houston Electric has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed   $100 million   in a consecutive   twelve  -month period, all or part of which Houston Electric intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date Houston Electric delivers its certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of Houston Electric s certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. 
    
  CERC Corp. s   $600 million   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.25%   based on CERC Corp. s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits CERC s consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed   65%   of CERC s consolidated capitalization.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CERC s debt to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   34.7%  .  
    
  CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC Corp. were in compliance with all financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(13)     Income Taxes    
    
  The effective tax rate reported for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was   35%   compared to   38%   for the same period in 2015. The effective tax rate reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   37%   compared to   41%   for the same period in 2015.  The higher effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to lower earnings from the impairment of CenterPoint Energy s investment in Enable.

CenterPoint Energy reported no uncertain tax liability as of September 30, 2016 and expects no significant change to the uncertain tax liability over the next twelve months.  CenterPoint Energy s consolidated federal income tax returns have been audited and settled through 2014.  CenterPoint Energy is under examination by the IRS for 2015 and 2016. 

(14)     Commitments and Contingencies    
    
           (a) 
    Natural Gas Supply Commitments 
       
  Natural gas supply commitments include natural gas contracts related to CenterPoint Energy s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services business segments, which have various quantity requirements and durations, that are not classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   as these contracts meet an exception as  normal purchases contracts  or do not meet the definition of a derivative.  Natural gas supply commitments also include natural gas transportation contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative.  As of   September 30, 2016  , minimum payment obligations for natural gas supply commitments are approximately   $132 million   for the remaining   three   months in 2016,   $454 million   in 2017,   $455 million   in 2018,   $267 million   in 2019,   $124 million   in 2020 and   $133 million   after 2020. 
    
           (b) 
    Legal, Environmental and Other Matters 
       
  Legal Matters 
    
  Gas Market Manipulation Cases  .  CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric or their predecessor, Reliant Energy, and certain of their former subsidiaries have been named as defendants in certain lawsuits described below.  Under a master separation agreement between CenterPoint Energy and a former subsidiary, RRI, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are entitled to be indemnified by RRI and its successors for any losses, including certain attorneys  fees and other costs, arising out of these lawsuits.  In May 2009, RRI sold its Texas retail business to a subsidiary of NRG and RRI changed its name to RRI Energy, Inc.  In December 2010, Mirant Corporation merged with and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of RRI, and RRI changed its name to GenOn. In December 2012, NRG acquired GenOn through a merger in which GenOn became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG.  None of the sale of the retail business, the merger with Mirant Corporation, or the acquisition of GenOn by NRG alters RRI s (now GenOn s) contractual obligations to indemnify CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries, including Houston Electric, for certain liabilities, including their indemnification obligations regarding the gas market manipulation litigation, nor does it affect the terms of existing guarantee arrangements for certain GenOn gas transportation contracts discussed below. 
    
  A large number of lawsuits were filed against numerous gas market participants in a number of federal and western state courts in connection with the operation of the natural gas markets in 2000 2002.  CenterPoint Energy and its affiliates have since been released or dismissed from all such cases.  CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp., was a defendant in a case now pending in federal court in Nevada alleging a conspiracy to inflate Wisconsin natural gas prices in 2000 2002.  On May 24, 2016, the district court granted CES s motion for summary judgment, dismissing CES from the case.  That ruling is subject to appeal.  CenterPoint Energy and CES intend to continue vigorously defending against the plaintiffs  claims.  CenterPoint Energy does not expect the ultimate outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.   CERC and its predecessors operated MGPs in the past.  With respect to certain Minnesota MGP sites, CERC has completed state-ordered remediation and continues state-ordered monitoring and water treatment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CERC had a recorded liability of   $7 million   for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in Minnesota.  The estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites for which CERC believes it may have responsibility was   $4 million   to   $29 million   based on remediation continuing for   30   to   50   years.  The cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size.  The actual remediation costs will depend on the number of sites to be remediated, the participation of other PRPs, if any, and the remediation methods used.   
    
  In addition to the Minnesota sites, the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CERC or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates.  CenterPoint Energy does not expect the ultimate outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either CenterPoint Energy or CERC. 
    
  Asbestos.     Some facilities owned by CenterPoint Energy or its predecessors contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestos-containing materials.  CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are from time to time named, along with numerous others, as defendants in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos, and CenterPoint Energy anticipates that additional claims may be asserted in the future.  Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

this time, CenterPoint Energy does not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Other Environmental.   From time to time CenterPoint Energy identifies the presence of environmental contaminants during its operations or on property where its predecessor companies have conducted operations.  Other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future.  CenterPoint Energy has and expects to continue to remediate identified sites consistent with its legal obligations.  From time to time CenterPoint Energy has received notices from regulatory authorities or others regarding its status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants.  In addition, CenterPoint Energy has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such sites.  Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, CenterPoint Energy does not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Other Proceedings 
    
  CenterPoint Energy is involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  From time to time, CenterPoint Energy is also a defendant in legal proceedings with respect to claims brought by various plaintiffs against broad groups of participants in the energy industry.  Some of these proceedings involve substantial amounts.  CenterPoint Energy regularly analyzes current information and, as necessary, provides accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters.  CenterPoint Energy does not expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
           (c) 
    Guarantees 
       
  Prior to the distribution of CenterPoint Energy s ownership in RRI to its shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC s obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately   $15 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2016 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC s obligations. 
    
  In 2010, CenterPoint Energy provided a guarantee (the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee) with respect to the performance of certain obligations of Enable under a long-term gas gathering and treating agreement with an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc.  Under the terms of the omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the formation of Enable, Enable and CenterPoint Energy have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to terminate the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee and to release CenterPoint Energy from such guarantee.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CenterPoint Energy had guaranteed Enable s obligations up to an aggregate amount of   $50 million   under the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee.  
    
  CERC Corp. had also provided a guarantee of collection of   $1.1 billion   of Enable s senior notes due 2019 and 2024.  This guarantee was subordinated to all senior debt of CERC Corp. and was automatically released on May 1, 2016.  
    
  The fair value of these guarantees is not material.

(15)     Earnings Per Share    
    
  The following table reconciles numerators and denominators of CenterPoint Energy s basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: 

(1) 
    1,759,000   incremental shares from assumed conversions of restricted stock have not been included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for either the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2015, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

(16)     Reportable Business Segments    
    
  CenterPoint Energy s determination of reportable business segments considers the strategic operating units under which CenterPoint Energy manages sales, allocates resources and assesses performance of various products and services to wholesale or retail customers in differing regulatory environments. CenterPoint Energy uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss for its business segments.

    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
       
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our Interim Condensed Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-Q and our   2015   Form 10-K. 

RECENT EVENTS 
    
  Houston Electric General Mortgage Bonds.      In August 2016, Houston Electric issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.40% general mortgage bonds due 2026.  The proceeds from the issuance of the bonds were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  DCRF.      In April 2016, Houston Electric filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment to account for changes in certain distribution-invested capital since its 2010 rate case.  The application requested the annualized DCRF charge to be set at $49.4 million.  This charge, effective September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2017, is based on an increase in eligible distribution-invested capital from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 of $689 million.  In June 2016, the parties reached a settlement providing for an annualized DCRF charge of $45 million effective September 2016 and, unless otherwise changed in a subsequent DCRF filing, an annualized DCRF charge of $49 million effective September 2017. In July 2016, the Texas Utility Commission approved the settlement.  On September 1, 2016, Houston Electric implemented new rates.  
    
  TCOS.     In July 2016, Houston Electric filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission for an interim update of its TCOS seeking an increase in annual revenues based on an incremental increase in total rate base of $95.6 million. Houston Electric received approval from the Texas Utility Commission in September 2016. An increase of $3.5 million in annual revenues is expected based on this approval. 
    
  Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast GRIP  .    NGD s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submitted annual GRIP filings in March 2016 representing an aggregate increase in revenue of $18.2 million based on incremental capital expenditures of $115.5 million. For each division, rates were approved and implemented by July 2016.  
    
  Arkansas Rate Case.      In November 2015, NGD filed a general rate case with the APSC requesting an annual increase of $35.6 million along with approval of the new Formula Rate Plan Tariff.  The APSC order was issued in September 2016 authorizing a $14.2 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.50% and approving the Formula Rate Plan Tariff. New rates were implemented in September 2016. 
    
  Minnesota CIP.    In May 2016, NGD filed a CIP request with the MPUC, seeking a $12.7 million financial incentive based on 2015 program performance.  In September, the MPUC issued its order approving the request. 
    
  Minnesota Decoupling.    In September 2016, NGD filed its Decoupling Report and rate adjustment with the MPUC.  The filing implements a $24.6 million decoupling adjustment reflecting revenue under-recovery during the July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 period. The adjustment was effective September 1, 2016, subject to subsequent review and approval.  Initial comments on the Decoupling Report are due November 1, 2016. 
    
  Mississippi RRA.     In July 2016, NGD filed an amended request with the MPSC for a $3.3 million RRA with an adjusted ROE of 9.47%.  After MPSC staff review and adjustments, a settlement was reached providing for a $2.7 million RRA, with an allowed ROE of 9.47%.  The settlement was approved by the MPSC, and rates were implemented in October 2016. 
    
  Atmos Energy Marketing Acquisition.    On October 31, 2016, CES, our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, announced an agreement to acquire Atmos Energy Marketing for approximately $120 million, including estimated working capital of $80 million.  The transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain third party consents and approvals, including expiration of any Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period.  We expect the transaction to close in early 2017.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. 

Three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  We reported net income of   $179 million   (  $0.41   per diluted share) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a net loss of   $391 million   (  $(0.91)   per diluted share) for the same period in   2015  .   
    
  The increase in net income of $570 million was due to the following key factors: 

a $867 million increase in equity earnings from our investment in Enable, as 2015 results included impairment charges of $862 million, discussed further in Note 8; 

a $211 million increase in the gain on marketable securities included in Other Income, net shown above; 

a $19 million increase in operating income (discussed below by segment); 

a $9 million increase in cash distributions on Series A Preferred Units included in Other Income, net shown above; 

a $5 million decrease in interest expense due to lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt; and 

a $2 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of our Securitization Bonds. 
       
  These increases in net income were partially offset by the following: 
    
     a $341 million increase in income tax expense due to higher income before tax; and 

a $201 million increase in losses on the underlying value of the indexed debt securities related to the ZENS included in Other Income, net shown above. 
       
  Nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  We reported net income of   $331 million   (  $0.76   per diluted share) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a net loss of   $183 million   (  $(0.43)   per diluted share) for the same period in   2015  .   
    
  The increase in net income of $514 million was due to the following key factors: 

a $863 million increase in equity earnings from our investment in Enable, as 2015 results included impairment charges of $862 million, discussed further in Note 8; 
     
   28 

     Table of Contents  

a $259 million increase in the gain on marketable securities included in Other Income, net shown above; 

a $13 million increase in cash distributions on Series A Preferred Units included in Other Income, net shown above; 

a $10 million decrease in interest expense due to lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt; 

a $10 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of our Securitization Bonds; and 

a $9 million increase in operating income (discussed below by segment). 
       
  These increases in net income were partially offset by the following: 

a $322 million increase in income tax expense due to higher income before tax; 

a $320 million increase in the loss on indexed debt securities related to the ZENS included in Other Income, net shown above, resulting from a loss of $117 million from the Charter merger in 2016 compared to a loss of $7 million from Verizon s acquisition of AOL in 2015 and increased losses of $210 million in the underlying value of the indexed debt securities; 

a $4 million decrease in interest income included in Other Income, net shown above; and 

a $3 million decrease in dividend income included in Other Income, net shown above. 
       
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  Our effective tax rate reported for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 35% compared to 38% for the same period in 2015.  The effective tax rate reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 37% compared to 41% for the same period in 2015.  The higher effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to lower earnings from the impairment of our investment in Enable.  We expect our annual effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2016 to be approximately 37%.  
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 
    
  The following table presents operating income for each of our business segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties at current market prices.

  Three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our Electric Transmission   Distribution business segment reported operating income of   $257 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisting of   $234 million   from the TDU and   $23 million   related to Bond Companies.  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , operating income totaled   $244 million  , consisting of   $219 million   from the TDU and   $25 million   related to Bond Companies.   
    
  TDU operating income increased $15 million due to the following key factors: 

higher equity return of $7 million, primarily related to true-up proceeds; 

higher DCRF revenues of $6 million, primarily due to the implementation of new rates in September from the 2016 filing; and 

30 

     Table of Contents  

higher transmission-related revenues of $18 million, which were partially offset by increased transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $13 million. 
       
  These increases to operating income were partially offset by higher depreciation, primarily due to ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $13 million. 
    
  Nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our Electric Transmission   Distribution business segment reported operating income of   $498 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisting of   $428 million   from the TDU and   $70 million   related to Bond Companies.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , operating income totaled   $498 million  , consisting of   $418 million   from the TDU and   $80 million   related to Bond Companies.   
    
  TDU operating income increased $10 million due to the following key factors: 

higher transmission-related revenues of $65 million, which were partially offset by increased transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $41 million; and 

higher equity return of $17 million, primarily related to true-up proceeds. 
       
  These increases to operating income were partially offset by the following: 

higher depreciation, primarily due to ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $38 million;  

higher operation and maintenance expenses of $8 million  ,   primarily due to contract services and corporate services; 

lower right-of-way revenues of $4 million; and 

lower usage, net of the weather hedge, of $3 million, primarily due to milder weather.

rate stabilization of $7 million, reflecting adjustments from decoupling in Minnesota and Arkansas; 

lower bad debt expense of $3 million; 

lower sales and use tax of $3 million; and 

customer growth of $1 million from the addition of approximately 35,000 new customers. 
       
  These increases were partially offset by the following: 

increased depreciation and amortization of $6 million, primarily due to ongoing additions to plant in service; and 

increased labor and benefits expense of $5 million. 
       
  Increased expense related to energy efficiency programs of $1 million and increased expense related to gross receipt taxes of $2 million were offset by corresponding related revenues.

     Table of Contents  

was primarily due to a $7 million decrease from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins.  The third quarter of 2016 included a $2 million mark-to-market charge compared to a $5 million mark-to-market benefit for the same period of 2015.  Throughput and number of customers increased substantially for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the Continuum acquisition compared to the same period of 2015.  Similarly, the increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 is attributable in part to the acquisition and includes $1 million of operation and maintenance expenses and $1 million of amortization expenses specifically related to the acquisition and integration of Continuum. 
    
  Nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our Energy Services business segment reported operating income of   $11 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $29 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in operating income of $18 million was primarily due to a $21 million decrease from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins.  The first three quarters of 2016 included an $18 million mark-to-market charge compared to a $3 million mark-to-market benefit for the same period of 2015. Throughput and number of customers increased substantially for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the Continuum acquisition compared to the same period of 2015 .  Similarly, the increase in operating income for the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 is attributable in part to the acquisition and includes $3 million of operation and maintenance expenses and $2 million of amortization expenses specifically related to the acquisition and integration of Continuum.  Operating income has also improved for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to increases in commercial retail margins in existing markets where our Energy Services  business presence has expanded relative to the acquisition.

  Historical Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

Cash Provided by Operating Activities  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   $66 million   compared to the same period in   2015   due to     changes in     working capital ($263 million), partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items ($182 million) (primarily depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes) and increased cash from other non-current items ($15 million).  The changes in working capital items in 2016 primarily related to decreased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable, fuel cost under recovery and net regulatory assets and liabilities, partially offset by increased cash provided by net other current assets and liabilities and margin deposits, net.  
    
  Cash Used in Investing Activities  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased   $285 million   compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to increased cash received for the repayment of notes receivable from Enable ($363 million), a return of capital from Enable ($  149 million  ), increased proceeds from the sale of marketable securities associated with the Charter merger ($146 million) and decreased capital expenditures (  $84 million  ), which were partially offset by increased cash used for the purchase of Series A Preferred Units ($363 million), increased cash used for the Continuum acquisition ($102 million) and increased restricted cash (  $11 million  ).  
    
  Cash Used in Financing Activities  
    
  Net cash used by financing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   increased   $142 million   compared to the same period in   2015   due to increased payments of long-term debt (  $342 million  ), decreased net proceeds from commercial paper (  $239 million  ), increased distributions to ZENS note holders ($146 million), increased payment of common stock dividends (  $13 million  ) and increased debt issuance costs (  $9 million  ), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of general mortgage bonds ($600 million) and increased short-term borrowings (  $7 million  ). 
    
  Future Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Our capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for our electric transmission and distribution operations and our natural gas distribution operations.  These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety as well as expand our systems through value-added projects.  Our principal anticipated cash requirements for the remaining   three   months of   2016   include the following: 

capital expenditures of approximately $334 million;  

scheduled principal payments on Securitization Bonds of $63 million;  
     
   35 

     Table of Contents  

dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy, Inc. common stock; and 

interest payments on debt. 
       
  We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, anticipated cash flows from operations   and distributions on our investments in common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units from Enable will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the remaining   three   months of 2016. Discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC s obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately   $15 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2016 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC s obligations. 
    
  In 2010, CenterPoint Energy provided a guarantee (the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee) with respect to the performance of certain obligations of Enable under a long-term gas gathering and treating agreement with an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc. Under the terms of the omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the formation of Enable, Enable and CenterPoint Energy have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to terminate the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee and to release CenterPoint Energy from such guarantee. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have guaranteed Enable s obligations up to an aggregate amount of   $50 million   under the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantee.  
    
  CERC Corp. had also provided a guarantee of collection of $1.1 billion of Enable s senior notes due 2019 and 2024.  This guarantee was subordinated to all senior debt of CERC Corp. and was automatically released on May 1, 2016.  
    
  The fair value of these guarantees is not material.  Other than the guarantees described above and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Regulatory Matters 
    
  Significant regulatory developments that have occurred since our   2015   Form 10-K was filed with the SEC are discussed below. 
    
  Houston Electric  
    
  Brazos Valley Connection Project.    In April 2016, the Texas Utility Commission issued an order on rehearing for the Brazos Valley Connection requiring Houston Electric to use steel monopoles in lieu of lattice towers for the construction to reduce the aesthetic impact of the project. The project is proceeding as scheduled, including land acquisition, procurement, vegetation clearing, and other work, and Houston Electric anticipates beginning construction in January 2017.  The Texas Utility Commission s original order provided an estimated range of approximately $270 $310 million for the capital costs for the Brazos Valley Connection. Houston Electric anticipates that the actual capital costs of the project may exceed that estimate, depending on land acquisition costs, material and construction costs, and other factors. After construction begins, Houston Electric will file its updated capital cost estimates with the Texas Utility Commission. Houston Electric expects to complete construction of the Brazos Valley Connection by mid-2018.   
    
  DCRF.      In April 2016, Houston Electric filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment to account for changes in certain distribution-invested capital since its 2010 rate case.  The application requested the annualized DCRF charge to be set at $49.4 million.  This charge, effective September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2017, is based on an increase in eligible distribution-invested capital from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 of $689 million.  In June

     Table of Contents  

2016, the parties reached a settlement providing for an annualized DCRF charge of $45 million effective September 2016 and, unless otherwise changed in a subsequent DCRF filing, an annualized DCRF charge of $49 million effective September 2017. In July 2016, the Texas Utility Commission approved the settlement.  On September 1, 2016, Houston Electric implemented new rates.  
    
  EECRF.    In June 2016, Houston Electric filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission for an adjustment to its EECRF to recover $45.9 million in 2017, including an incentive of $10.6 million based on 2015 program performance.  Houston Electric requested approval effective by March 2017.  In September 2016, the parties reached a settlement agreement providing for recovery of $45.5 million in 2017, including an incentive of $10.6 million.  The agreement was approved by the Texas Utility Commission in October 2016. 
    
  TCOS.   In July 2016, Houston Electric filed an application with the Texas Utility Commission for an interim update of its TCOS seeking an increase in annual revenues based on an incremental increase in total rate base of $95.6 million. Houston Electric received approval from the Texas Utility Commission in September 2016. An increase of $3.5 million in annual revenues is expected based on this approval. 
    
  CERC 
    
  Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast GRIP  .  NGD s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submitted annual GRIP filings in March 2016 representing an aggregate increase in revenue of $18.2 million based on incremental capital expenditures of $115.5 million. For each division, rates were approved and implemented by July 2016.  
    
  Oklahoma PBRC and Energy Efficiency Rate.    In March 2016, NGD made a PBRC filing for the 2015 calendar year. In July  2016, the OCC approved a settlement agreement for no change in rates and a new ROE of 10% to be implemented with the 2017 filing for the 2016 test year. The capital structure was also modified to 54.96% common equity, 0.04% preferred equity and 45% debt.  In March 2016, NGD also made an Energy Efficiency filing to recover $2.4 million in estimated expenses for energy efficiency programs approved by the OCC, plus a utility incentive earned for the 2016 program year with adjustments for any over- or under-recovery from prior periods. 
    
  Arkansas Rate Case.    In November 2015, NGD filed a general rate case with the APSC requesting an annual increase of $35.6 million along with approval of the new Formula Rate Plan Tariff.  The APSC order was issued in September 2016 authorizing a $14.2 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.50% and approving the Formula Rate Plan Tariff. New rates were implemented in September 2016. 
    
  Arkansas EECR.    In August 2016, NGD made an amended EECR filing with the APSC to recover $11.0 million for the 2017 program year. The purpose of the EECR is to recover NGD s estimated expenses and lost contributions to fixed cost for the energy efficiency programs approved by the APSC and administered either jointly or individually by NGD, plus a utility incentive earned for 2015, with adjustments for any over- or under-recovery from the prior period.  New rates will go into effect January 1, 2017 pending APSC approval. 
    
  Louisiana RSP.    NGD made its 2016 Louisiana RSP filings with the LPSC in September 2016.  The North Louisiana Rider RSP shows a revenue deficiency of $1.7 million, and the South Louisiana Rider RSP filing shows a revenue surplus of $0.4 million.  Both 2016 Louisiana RSP filings utilized the capital structure and ROE factors approved by the LPSC in September 2015, which set an authorized ROE of 9.95% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity. NGD will begin billing in December 2016, subject to a refund.   
    
  NGD made its 2015 Louisiana RSP filings with the LPSC in October 2015. The North Louisiana Rider RSP filing shows a revenue deficiency of $1.0 million, and the South Louisiana Rider RSP filing shows a revenue deficiency of $1.5 million. Both 2015 Louisiana RSP filings utilized the capital structure and ROE factors approved by the LPSC in September 2015, which set an authorized ROE of 9.95% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity. NGD began billing in December 2015, subject to a refund.  The 2015 Louisiana RSP filing is still subject to final approval from the LPSC.  
    
  NGD made its 2014 Louisiana RSP filings with the LPSC in October 2014. The North Louisiana Rider RSP filing showed a revenue deficiency of $4.0 million, using the then-authorized ROE of 10.25% with a capital structure of 53% debt and 47% equity. The South Louisiana Rider RSP filing showed a revenue deficiency of $2.3 million, using the then-authorized ROE of 10.5% with a capital structure of 53% debt and 47% equity. NGD began billing the revised rates in December 2014, subject to refund or surcharge.  After LPSC staff review and adjustments to conform to the RSP changes ordered by the LPSC in the 2013 RSP cases as approved in September 2015, NGD settled on an adjustment for the North Louisiana Rider RSP of $4.7 million, with an authorized ROE of 9.95% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity.  NGD also settled on an adjustment for the South Louisiana

     Table of Contents  

Rider RSP of $2.5 million, with an authorized ROE of 9.95% and a capital structure of 48% debt and 52% equity.  The settlements were approved by the LPSC and rates were implemented in July 2016. 
    
  Minnesota Rate Case.     In August 2015, NGD filed a general rate case with the MPUC requesting an annual increase of $54.1 million.  In September 2015, the MPUC approved an interim increase of $47.8 million in revenues effective October 2, 2015, subject to a refund.  The MPUC order was issued in June 2016 authorizing a $27.5 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.49%. In June 2016, NGD filed a request for reconsideration.  The MPUC denied the request for reconsideration in August 2016 and in September 2016, NGD made its required compliance filing. NGD will implement final rates and the interim rate refund in December 2016. 
    
  Minnesota CIP.    In May 2016, NGD filed a CIP request with the MPUC, seeking a $12.7 million financial incentive based on 2015 program performance.  In September 2016, the MPUC issued its order approving the request. 
    
  Minnesota CIP Financial Incentive Mechanism.    In September 2015, the MPUC requested comments on proposed changes to the CIP financial incentive mechanism. Parties filed comments in January, February and April 2016. In August 2016, the MPUC adopted a declining schedule of incentives over the 2017 2019 period.  The incentive will be based on a percentage of net benefits of 13.5% in 2017, 12% in 2018, and 10% in 2019 and a cap based on a percentage of expenditures of 40% in 2017, 35% in 2018, and 30% in 2019.  In August 2016, Xcel Energy filed a request for reconsideration.  In October 2016, the MPUC issued an order denying Xcel Energy s request for reconsideration. 
    
  Minnesota Decoupling.    On September 1, 2016, NGD filed its Decoupling Report and rate adjustment with the MPUC.  The filing implements a $24.6 million decoupling adjustment reflecting revenue under recovery during the July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 period. The adjustment was effective September 1, 2016, subject to subsequent review and approval.  Initial comments on the Decoupling Report are due November 1, 2016. 
    
  Mississippi RRA.    In July 2016, NGD filed an amended request with the MPSC for a $3.3 million RRA with an adjusted ROE of 9.47%.  After MPSC staff review and adjustments, a settlement was reached providing for a $2.7 million RRA, with an allowed ROE of 9.47%.  The settlement was approved by the MPSC, and rates were implemented in October 2016. 
    
  Mississippi EECR.    In July 2016, the MPSC approved NGD s 2016 EECR filing for $0.9 million, which includes energy efficiency program costs and lost contribution to fixed costs.  Rates were implemented in July 2016. 
    
  PHMSA Regulatory Proposals.    Recent regulatory proposals from the U.S. Department of Transportation s PHMSA would expand the scope of its safety, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for both natural gas and hazardous liquids (including oil and NGLs) pipelines.  These proposals, if finalized, would impose additional costs on us and Enable. 
    
  In March 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing proposed revisions to the safety standards applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rules would add requirements for pipelines already subject to integrity management requirements, including material verification procedures, repair criteria for pipelines in high consequence areas and requirements for monitoring gas quality and managing corrosion.  For pipelines not already subject to integrity management requirements, the proposed rules include a new moderate consequence area definition, require gas quality monitoring and corrosion management, establish repair criteria and require verification of certain pipeline parameters.  The proposed rules would also expand the scope of gas gathering lines subject to PHMSA regulation including imposing minimum safety standards on certain larger, currently exempt, gathering lines while subjecting all gathering-line operators to recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements from which they are currently exempt. Other proposed changes, such as the modification to the definition of a transmission line, some record-keeping requirements, and some material verification obligations also may impact distribution pipelines despite PHMSA s insistence that is not its intent. PHMSA is currently reviewing thousands of public comments submitted in July 2016.  
    
  PHMSA also issued a similar notice of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines in October 2015. Both of these notices of proposed rulemaking would require inspections of pipeline areas affected by severe weather, natural disasters or similar events.  In addition, the proposed hazardous liquid rule would extend PHMSA reporting requirements to all gathering lines, require pipeline inspections in areas affected by extreme weather or natural disasters, require use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modify applicable repair criteria and set a timeline for pipelines subject to integrity management requirements to be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools. PHMSA expects the final rule for hazardous liquid pipelines to be issued before the end of 2016.

Other Matters 
    
  Debt Financing Transactions 
    
   In     May 2016, Houston Electric issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.85% general mortgage bonds due 2021.  In     August 2016, Houston Electric issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.40% general mortgage bonds due 2026.  The proceeds from the issuance of the bonds were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  Our revolving credit facilities may be drawn on by the companies from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate purposes and to backstop the companies  commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit.  As of   October 21, 2016  , we had the following facilities: 

(1) 
    Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facility of each of Houston Electric and CERC Corp., we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated $2.5 billion as of   September 30, 2016  .  
       
           (2) 
    Represents outstanding commercial paper of $480 million and outstanding letters of credit of $6 million. 
       
           (3) 
    Represents outstanding letters of credit. 
       
           (4) 
    Represents outstanding commercial paper of $375 million and outstanding letters of credit of $4 million. 
       
  Our   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.25%   based on CenterPoint Energy s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits our consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed   65%   of our consolidated capitalization.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt (excluding Securitization Bonds) to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   55.5%  .  The financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from   65%   to   70%   if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that Houston Electric has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed   $100 million   in a consecutive   twelve  -month period, all or part of which Houston Electric intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. 
    
  Houston Electric s   $300 million   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.125%   based on Houston Electric s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits Houston Electric s consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed   65%   of Houston Electric s consolidated capitalization. As of   September 30, 2016  , Houston Electric s debt (excluding Securitization Bonds) to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   51.7%  .   The financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and Houston Electric certifies to the administrative agent that Houston Electric has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which Houston Electric intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date Houston Electric delivers its certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of Houston Electric s certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. 
    
  CERC Corp. s   $600 million   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to terminate on   March 3, 2021  , can be drawn at   LIBOR   plus   1.25%   based on CERC Corp. s current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits CERC s consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed   65%   of CERC s consolidated capitalization.  As of   September 30, 2016  , CERC s debt to capital ratio, as defined in its credit facility agreement, was   34.7%  .

Borrowings under each of the three revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary.  The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the three revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower s credit rating.  The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities. 
    
  On April 4, 2016, in connection with the replacement of our $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the new $1.6 billion facility, we increased the size of our commercial paper program to permit the issuance of commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the unused portion of our $1.6 billion facility. The size of CERC Corp. s commercial paper program will remain at $600 million.  Our   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility backstops our $1.6 billion commercial paper program. CERC Corp. s $600 million revolving credit facility backstops its $600 million commercial paper program.  
    
  Securities Registered with the SEC 
    
  CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC Corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. s senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy s senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy s shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. 
    
  Temporary Investments 
    
  As of   October 21, 2016  , we had no temporary external investments. 
    
  Money Pool 
    
  We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. 
    
  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings    
    
  The interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. As of   October 21, 2016  , Moody s, S P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries:

  We cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies.

A decline in credit ratings from Moody s or S P could increase borrowing costs under our   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility, Houston Electric s $300 million revolving credit facility and CERC Corp. s $600 million revolving credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of Houston Electric or CERC Corp. had been downgraded one notch by Moody s and/or S P from the ratings that existed at   September 30, 2016  , the impact on the borrowing costs under the three revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market.  Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services business segments. 
    
  CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $140 million based on CERC Corp. s S P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of A-. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded or if the credit threshold is decreased due to a credit rating downgrade. 
    
  CES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our  Energy Services business segment, provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. To economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately   $23 million  . Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of   September 30, 2016  , unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregated   $337 million  , and   $1 million   of such amount was utilized. 
    
  Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody s and S P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months  charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as   $163 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. 
    
  ZENS and Securities Related to ZENS 
    
  In September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $828 million remains outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of TW Common attributable to such note.  The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of   September 30, 2016  , the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.0625 share of Time Common and 0.061382 share of Charter Common, and the contingent principal amount was   $517 million  .  
    
   On May 26, 2015, Charter announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with TWC. On September 21, 2015, Charter shareholders approved the announced transaction with TWC.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon closing of the merger, TWC Common would be exchanged for cash and Charter Common and as a result, reference shares for the ZENS would consist of Charter Common, TW Common and Time Common.  The merger closed on May 18, 2016.  For further information regarding the Charter merger, see Note 11 to our Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, Charter Common and Time Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, Charter Common and Time Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes.  ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, Charter Common and Time Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, Charter Common and Time Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes.  If all ZENS notes had been exchanged for cash on   September 30, 2016  , deferred taxes of approximately   $491 million   would  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

have been payable in   2016  .  If all the TW Common, Charter Common and Time Common had been sold on   September 30, 2016  , capital gains taxes of approximately   $246 million   would have been payable in   2016  . 
    
  Cross Defaults 
    
  Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default.  A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries  debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.  
    
  Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures 
    
  From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. 
    
  In February 2016, we announced that we were exploring the use of a REIT business model for all or part of our utility businesses.  We have completed our evaluation and have decided not to pursue forming a REIT structure for our utility business or any part thereof at this time.  We also announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in Enable, including a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and we continue to evaluate our alternatives, including retaining our investment. There can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action, and we do not intend to disclose further developments on these initiatives unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise required. 
    
  Enable Midstream Partners 
    
  On January 28, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with Enable pursuant to which we agreed to purchase in a Private Placement an aggregate of 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit. The Private Placement closed on February 18, 2016. In connection with the Private Placement, Enable redeemed approximately $363 million of notes scheduled to mature in 2017 payable to a wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. We used the proceeds from this redemption for our investment in the Series A Preferred Units. 
    
  Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as  available cash ) within 60 days after the end of each quarter. On   November 1, 2016  , Enable declared a quarterly cash distribution of   $0.318   per unit on all of its outstanding common and subordinated units for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  Accordingly, CERC Corp. expects to receive a cash distribution of approximately   $74 million   from Enable in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be made with respect to CERC Corp. s limited partner interest in Enable for the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  On   November 1, 2016  , Enable declared a quarterly cash distribution of   $0.625   per Series A Preferred Unit for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy expects to receive a cash distribution of approximately   $9 million   from Enable in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be made with respect to CenterPoint Energy s investment in Series A Preferred Units of Enable for the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt Issuances 
    
  In April 2016, Houston Electric entered into forward interest rate agreements with several counterparties, having an aggregate notional amount of $150 million. These agreements were executed to hedge, in part, volatility in the 5-year U.S. treasury rate by reducing Houston Electric s exposure to variability in cash flows related to interest payments of Houston Electric s $300 million issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2016. These forward interest rate agreements were designated as cash flow hedges. The realized gains and losses associated with the agreements were immaterial. 
     
  In June and July 2016, Houston Electric entered into forward interest rate agreements with several counterparties, having an aggregate notional amount of $300 million. These agreements were executed to hedge, in part, volatility in the 10-year U.S. treasury rate by reducing Houston Electric s exposure to variability in cash flows related to interest payments of Houston Electric s $300

million issuance of fixed rate debt in August 2016.  These forward interest rate agreements were designated as cash flow hedges.  Accordingly, the effective portion of realized gains and losses associated with the agreements, which totaled $1.1 million, is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the life of the bonds.  The ineffective portion of the gains and losses was recorded in income and was immaterial. 
    
  Weather Hedge 
    
  We have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that mitigate the impact of weather on NGD in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota and Oklahoma. NGD and electric operations in Texas do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for NGD compared to our other jurisdictions. As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on NGD s results in Texas and on Houston Electric s results in its service territory. We have historically entered into heating-degree day swaps for certain NGD jurisdictions to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather on its results of operations and cash flows for the winter heating season.  However, NGD did not enter into heating-degree day swaps for the 2015 2016 winter season as a result of NGD s Minnesota division implementing a full decoupling pilot in July 2015.  We entered into a weather hedge swap pursuant to the Dodd-Frank s end-user exception for Houston Electric s service territory for the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 winter seasons. 
    
  Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements    
    
  In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: 

cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services business segments; 

acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; 

increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; 

increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; 

various legislative or regulatory actions; 

incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; 

the ability of GenOn and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of GenOn s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which our subsidiary is  their guarantor; 

the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings Corp., to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries;  

slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; 

the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; 

contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; 

restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and 

various other risks identified in  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part I of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
       
  Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money 
    
  Houston Electric s revolving credit facility limits Houston Electric s consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization.  CERC Corp. s revolving credit facility limits CERC s consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization.  Our revolving

     Table of Contents  

credit facility limits our consolidated debt (with certain exceptions, including but not limited to Securitization Bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization.  The financial covenant limit in Houston Electric s and our revolving credit facilities will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. Additionally, Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding long-term debt, lease obligations and obligations under our ZENS (indexed debt securities) that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our floating-rate obligations aggregated   $998 million   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 10% from   September 30, 2016   rates, our combined interest expense would increase by approximately $1 million annually. 
    
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) aggregating   $7.5 billion   in principal amount and having a fair value of   $8.2 billion   and   $8.0 billion  , respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately   $196 million   if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels at   September 30, 2016  . In general, such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.  
    
  The ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of   $112 million   as of   September 30, 2016   was a fixed-rate obligation and, therefore, did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately   $20 million   if interest rates were to decline by 10% from levels at   September 30, 2016  . Changes in the fair value of the derivative component, a liability recorded at   $562 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , are recorded in our Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income and, therefore, we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the risk-free interest rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10% from   September 30, 2016   levels, the fair value of the derivative component would increase by approximately   $3 million  , which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. 
    
  Equity Market Value Risk 
    
  We are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of   7.1 million   shares of TW Common,   0.9 million   shares of Time Common and   0.9 million   shares of Charter Common, which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the ZENS. A decrease of 10% from the   September 30, 2016   aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of approximately   $5 million  , which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities 
    
  We use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses. The stand-alone commodity risk created by these instruments, without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge, is described below. We measure the commodity risk of our non-trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis performed on our non-trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10% movement in energy prices. As of   September 30, 2016  , the recorded fair value of our non-trading energy derivatives was a net asset of   $44 million   (before collateral), all of which is related to our Energy Services business segment.  An increase of 10% in the market prices of energy commodities from their   September 30, 2016   levels would have decreased the fair value of our non-trading energy derivatives net asset by   $11 million  .  
    
  The above analysis of the non-trading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our non-derivative physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate. Furthermore, the non-trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

the physical transaction portfolio, reducing overall risks within limits. Therefore, the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non-trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions. 

Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.   
    
  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

  Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges.    The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   2.73   and   2.68  , respectively. We do not believe that the ratios for these   nine  -month periods are necessarily indicative of the ratios for the twelve-month periods due to the seasonal nature of our business. The ratios were calculated pursuant to applicable rules of the SEC.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY HOUSTON ELECTRIC, LLC 
  OFFICER S CERTIFICATE 
    
  August 11, 2016 
    
  I, the undersigned officer of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (the  Company ), do hereby certify that I am an Authorized Officer of the Company as such term is defined in the Indenture (as defined herein). I am delivering this certificate pursuant to the authority granted in the Resolutions adopted by written consent of the sole Manager of the Company dated August 3, 2016, and Sections 105, 201, 301, 401(1), 401(5), 403(2)(B) and 1403 of the General Mortgage Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2002, as           heretofore supplemented to the date hereof (as heretofore supplemented, the  Indenture ),         between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (successor in trust to JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Trustee (the  Trustee ). Terms used herein and    not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture, unless         the context clearly requires otherwise. Based upon the foregoing, I hereby certify on behalf of             the Company as follows: 
    
  1.  The terms and conditions of the Securities of the series described in this Officer s        Certificate are as follows (the numbered subdivisions set forth in this Paragraph 1 corresponding to the numbered subdivisions of Section 301 of the Indenture): 
    
  (1)  The Securities of the twenty-sixth series to be issued under the Indenture shall be designated as the  2.40% General Mortgage Bonds, Series Z, due 2026  (the  Bonds ),          as set forth in the Twenty-Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of the date hereof,        between the Company and the Trustee. 
  (2)  The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Bonds for original issue on August 11, 2016 (the  Issue Date ) in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000, upon a Company Order for the authentication and delivery thereof and satisfaction of Section             401 of the Indenture. 
  (3)  Interest on the Bonds shall be payable to the Persons in whose names such         Securities are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such         interest (as specified in (5) below), except as otherwise expressly provided in the form of such Securities attached hereto as   Exhibit A  . 
  (4)  The Bonds shall mature and the principal thereof shall be due and payable              together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on September 1, 2026. 
  (5)  The Bonds shall bear interest at the rate of 2.40% per annum. Interest shall                  accrue on the Bonds from the Issue Date, or the most recent date to which interest has           been paid or duly provided for. The Interest Payment Dates for the Bonds shall be March    1 and September 1 in each year commencing March 1, 2017, and the Regular Record             Dates with respect to the Interest Payment Dates for the Bonds shall be the February 15     and August 15, respectively, immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date (whether or  not  a  Business  Day);   provided   however  that  interest  payable  at   maturity,  upon 

redemption or when principal is otherwise due will be payable to the Holder to whom principal is payable. 
  (6)  The Corporate Trust Office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association in New York, New York shall be the place at which (i) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall be payable, (ii) registration of       transfer of the Bonds may be effected, (iii) exchanges of  the Bonds may be  effected,  and 
  (iv) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Bonds and the            Indenture may be served; and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association shall be the Security Registrar and Paying Agent for the Bonds; provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to change, by one or more Officer s Certificates, any such place or the Security Registrar; and provided, further, that the   Company reserves the right to designate, by one or more Officer s Certificates, its           principal office in Houston, Texas as any such place or itself as the Security Registrar; provided, however, that there shall be only a single Security Registrar for each series of Bonds. 
  (7)  The Bonds shall be redeemable, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, on any date prior to June 1, 2026 at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed or (ii) the sum         of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Bonds to be redeemed that would be due if the Bonds matured on June 1, 2026 but for the redemption (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the date of redemption (the  Redemption Date ) on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid          interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date. On or after                June 1, 2026, the Company may redeem the Bonds, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, by paying 100% of the principal amount of Bonds to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date. 
   Treasury Rate  means, with respect to any Redemption Date the yield calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date, as follows: for the latest day that appears in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as  Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15  (or any successor publication) ( H.15 ) under the caption  Treasury Constant Maturities - Nominal , the independent investment banker shall select two yields   one for the            maturity immediately before and one for the maturity immediately after the remaining maturity of the notes (assuming the notes matured on June 1, 2026)   and shall                 interpolate on a straight-line basis using such yields; if there is no such maturity either     before or after, the independent investment banker shall select the maturity closest to               June 1, 2026 that appears on the release; or if such release (or any successor release) is          not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such       yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated by the Independent Investment Banker using a         price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal          amount)   equal  to  the  Comparable  Treasury  Price  for  such   Redemption  Date.    The 
  
   3 

Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third      Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. 
   Comparable Treasury Issue  means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable     to the remaining term ( remaining life ) of the Bonds to be redeemed (assuming for this purpose that the Bonds matured on June 1, 2026) that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Bonds. 
   Comparable Treasury Price  means (1) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker         obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all            such quotations. 
   Independent Investment Banker  means one of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated or RBC Capital Markets, LLC as specified by the Company, or if these firms are unwilling or unable to select the          Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing selected by the Company. 
   Reference Treasury Dealer  means each of (1) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated and RBC Capital Markets, LLC and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to   be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States of America (a            Primary Treasury Dealer ), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary      Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company              after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker. 
   Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations  means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the             Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third             business day preceding such Redemption Date. 
  The Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, will send a notice of     redemption to each holder of Bonds to be redeemed by first-class mail (or in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company with respect to Bonds registered        in the name of Cede   Co.) at least 15 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed    for redemption. Unless the Company defaults on payment of the redemption price,             interest will cease to accrue on the Bonds or portions thereof called for redemption on the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the Bonds are to be redeemed, not more than 60          days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Bonds or portions thereof for            redemption will be selected from the outstanding Bonds not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may select for                  redemption Bonds and portions of Bonds in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of     $1,000.  In  the  case of a partial  redemption  of  Bonds  registered in  the name of Cede   
  
   4 

Co, the Bonds to be redeemed will be determined in accordance with the procedures of       The Depository Trust Company. 
           (8) 
    Not applicable. 
              (9) 
    Not applicable. 
            (17)  The Bonds shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below). The Depositary Trust Company shall initially serve as Depositary (as defined below) with respect to the Global Securities.  Depositary  means, with respect to Securities of any series issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act that is designated to act as depositary for such Securities.  Global Security  means a Security           that evidences all or part of the Securities of a series and bears a legend in substantially       the following form: 
  THIS SECURITY IS IN GLOBAL FORM AND IS REGISTERED IN         THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A            DEPOSITARY. THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE         LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE      AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY              THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY               A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY. 
  The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: 
  (1)  Each Global Security authenticated under the Indenture shall be registered in    the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of the Indenture. 
  (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global    Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) the Company has notified the Trustee  that the  Depositary is  unwilling  or  unable to continue as Depositary

The       Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. 
    
   Comparable Treasury Issue  means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment      Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term ( remaining life ) of this           Security to be redeemed (assuming for this purpose that this Security matured on June 1, 2026) that would be                  utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of             corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security. 
    
   Comparable Treasury Price  means (1) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the    Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of   all such quotations. 
    
   Independent Investment Banker  means one of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,         Fenner   Smith Incorporated or RBC Capital Markets, LLC as specified by the Company, or if these firms are         unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of           national standing selected by the Company. 
    
   Reference Treasury Dealer  means each of (1) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,            Fenner   Smith Incorporated and RBC Capital Markets, LLC and their respective successors;   provided  ,   however  ,        that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States of         America (a  Primary Treasury Dealer ), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and   (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker. 
    
   Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations  means with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date. 
    
  The Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, will send a notice of redemption to each Holder of Securities        to be redeemed by first-class mail (or in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company with         respect to Securities registered in the name of Cede   Co.) at least 15 and not more than 60 days prior to the date      fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults on payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on  the  Securities  or  portions  thereof  called  for  redemption  on  the  Redemption  Date. If  fewer  than  all  of  the

In the case of a partial redemption of Securities registered in the name of Cede   Co, the Securities to be redeemed will be determined in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company.
