  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  Note 1.       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  
  Basis of Presentation:   The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Peoples Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Peoples" refers to Peoples Bancorp Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively, except where the context indicates the reference relates solely to Peoples Bancorp Inc.) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not contain all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with Peoples  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ). 
  The accounting and reporting policies followed in the presentation of the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Peoples    2015   Form 10-K, as updated by the information contained in this Form 10-Q.  Management has evaluated all significant events and transactions that occurred after   September 30, 2016   for potential recognition or disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information for the periods and dates indicated.  Such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015  , contained herein, has been derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheet included in Peoples    2015   Form 10-K.  
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year, due in part to seasonal variations and unusual or infrequently occurring items.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements:   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by Peoples as of the required effective dates.  Unless otherwise discussed, management believes the impact of any recently issued standards, including those issued but not yet effective, will not have a material impact on Peoples' financial statements taken as a whole. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This new accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020, for Peoples).  The adoption of the new accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on Peoples' statement of cash flow.   
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The revised accounting guidance will remove all recognition thresholds and will require a company to recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost basis of a financial instrument and the amount of amortized cost that the company expects to collect over the instrument's contractual life.  It also amends the credit loss measurement guidance for available-for-sale debt securities and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets.  This new accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020, for Peoples).  Peoples is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance on Peoples' consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  This accounting guidance can be implemented using either a retrospective method or a cumulative-effect approach.  This accounting guidance provides clarification of the collectibility criterion and when revenue would be recognized for certain contracts.  This new accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (effective January 1, 2019, for Peoples).  Management's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of the new accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on Peoples' financial condition or results of operations.  There are many aspects of the new accounting guidance that are still being interpreted, and the FASB has recently issued and proposed updates to certain aspects of the guidance.  Therefore, the results of Peoples' preliminary analysis of the materiality of the adoption of the new accounting guidance may change based on the conclusions reached as to the application of the new accounting guidance.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 - Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The objective of the simplification initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of US GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements.  The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value are to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the accounting guidance is adopted.  For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Peoples will adopt this new accounting guidance as required, and it is not expected to have a material impact on Peoples' results of operations.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the accounting guidance issued by the FASB in May 2014 that revised the criteria for determining when to recognize revenue from contracts with customers and expanded disclosure requirements.  The amendment defers the effective date by one year (reflected below).  This accounting guidance can be implemented using either a retrospective method or a cumulative-effect approach.  This new accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (effective January 1, 2019, for Peoples).  Early adoption is permitted but only for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Peoples has elected to implement the new accounting guidance using a cumulative-effect approach and will adopt this new accounting guidance as required.  Management's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of the new accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on Peoples' financial condition or results of operations.  There are many aspects of the new accounting guidance that are still being interpreted, and the FASB has recently issued and proposed updates to certain aspects of the accounting guidance.  Therefore, the results of Peoples' preliminary analysis of the materiality of the adoption of the new accounting guidance may change based on the conclusions reached as to the application of the new accounting guidance.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.  The amendment is intended to resolve the diversity in practice by assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to the debt instrument hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.  When a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks.  For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Peoples is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance on Peoples' consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a material impact. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842).  The amendment was issued to improve the financial reporting of leasing activities and provide a faithful representation of leasing transactions and improve understanding and comparability of a lessee's financial statements.  Under the new accounting guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  The ASU will require both finance and operating leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU will affect all companies and organizations that lease real estate.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 (effective January 1, 2019, for Peoples).  Peoples will adopt this new accounting guidance as required, but it is not expected to have a material impact on Peoples' consolidated financial statements.   
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendment is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more useful information.  The new ASU requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  However, a reporting organization may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment (if any), from observable price changes in orderly transactions for similar investments of the same issuer.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020, for Peoples).  Peoples is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance on Peoples' consolidated financial statements which may result in an impact to the income statement on a quarterly and annual basis, as market rates fluctuate.  Peoples will adopt this accounting guidance as required.

Note 2.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  
  Available-for-sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis comprised the following:  

Held-to-maturity securities reported at fair value comprised the following: 

The fair values used by Peoples are obtained from an independent pricing service and represent either quoted market prices for the identical securities (Level 1 inputs) or fair values determined by pricing models using a market approach that considers observable market data, such as interest rate volatility, LIBOR yield curves, credit spreads and prices from market makers and live trading systems (Level 2).  Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided, and challenges prices when management believes a material discrepancy in pricing exists.

     Table of Contents  

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).  Financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis included the following: 
  Impaired Loans:   Impaired loans are measured and reported at fair value when the amounts to be received are less than the carrying value of the loans.  One of the allowable methods for determining the amount of impairment is estimating fair value using the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans.  Management s determination of the fair value for these loans uses a market approach representing the estimated net proceeds to be received from the sale of the collateral based on observable market prices or market value provided by independent, licensed or certified appraisers (Level 2 inputs).  At   September 30, 2016  , impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $44.7 million   were measured and reported at a fair value of   $36.8 million  .  For the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Peoples recognized   $58,000   and $  63,000   of losses on impaired loans, respectively, through the allowance for loan losses.  
  The following table presents the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried on Peoples  Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis:  

(1) Includes loans held for sale 
  (2) For additional information, see Note 10. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
  The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above.  For certain financial assets and liabilities, carrying value approximates fair value due to the nature of the financial instrument.  These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, demand and other non-maturity deposits, and overnight borrowings.  Peoples used the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of the following financial instruments: 
  Loans:   The fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the notes to a third-party financial investor.  Accordingly, this value is not necessarily the value to Peoples if the notes were held to maturity.  Peoples considered interest rate, credit and market factors in estimating the fair value of loans (Level 3 inputs).  In the current whole loan market, financial investors are generally requiring a much higher rate of return than the return inherent in loans if held to maturity given the lack of market liquidity.  This divergence accounts for the majority of the difference in carrying amount over fair value.  
  Deposits:   The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation based on current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2 inputs). 
  Long-term Borrowings:   The fair value of long-term borrowings is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on rates currently available to Peoples for borrowings with similar terms (Level 2 inputs).  
  Cash flow hedges:   The fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. The fair value for derivative instruments is determined based on market prices, broker-dealer quotations on similar products, or other related input parameters (Level 2 inputs).  
  Bank premises and equipment, customer relationships, deposit base, banking center networks, and other information required to compute Peoples  aggregate fair value are not included in the above information.  Accordingly, the above fair values are not intended to represent the aggregate fair value of Peoples.

Note 3.       Investment Securities    
  
  Available-for-sale 
  The following table summarizes Peoples' available-for-sale investment securities: 

Peoples' investment in equity securities was comprised largely of common stocks issued by various unrelated bank holding companies at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   securities of a single issuer that exceeded   10%   of stockholders' equity.  
  The gross gains and gross losses realized by Peoples from sales of available-for-sale securities for the periods ended   September 30   were as follows: 

The cost of investment securities sold, and any resulting gain or loss, was based on the specific identification method and recognized as of the trade date.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents a summary of available-for-sale investment securities that had an unrealized loss: 

Management systematically evaluates available-for-sale investment securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis. At   September 30, 2016  , management concluded no individual securities were other-than-temporarily impaired since Peoples did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that Peoples would be required to sell any of the securities with an unrealized loss prior to recovery.  Further, the unrealized losses at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were largely attributable to changes in market interest rates and spreads since the securities were purchased. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   99%   of the mortgage-backed securities market value that had been at an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more were issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies.  The remaining   1%  , or   two   positions, consisted of privately issued mortgage-backed securities with all of the underlying mortgages originated prior to 2004.  Both of these   two   positions had a fair value less than   90%   of their book value, with an aggregate book and fair value of   $0.7 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively.  Management analyzed the underlying credit quality of these securities and concluded the unrealized losses were primarily attributable to the floating rate nature of these investments and the low number of loans remaining in these securities. 
  Furthermore, the   three   bank-issued trust preferred securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more at   September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to the floating-rate nature of those investments, the current interest rate environment and spreads within that sector.

The table below presents the amortized cost, fair value and total weighted-average yield of available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity at   September 30, 2016  .  The weighted-average yields are based on the amortized cost.  In some cases, the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties prior to the contractual maturity date.  Rates are calculated on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a   35%   federal income tax rate. 

Held-to-Maturity 
  The following table summarizes Peoples  held-to-maturity investment securities: 

There were   no   gross gains or gross losses realized by Peoples from sales of held-to-maturity securities for the   three   or nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Other Securities 
  Peoples' other investment securities on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet consist largely of shares of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the  FHLB ) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (the "FRB"). 
  Pledged Securities 
  Peoples had pledged available-for-sale investment securities with carrying values of   $529.0 million   and   $495.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and held-to-maturity investment securities with carrying values of   $20.2 million   and   $21.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, to secure public and trust department deposits, and repurchase agreements in accordance with federal and state requirements.  Peoples also pledged available-for-sale investment securities with carrying values of   $9.8 million   and   $11.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and held-to-maturity securities with carrying values of   $22.5 million   and   $23.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, to secure additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the FRB.

Note 4.       Loans 
  
  Peoples' loan portfolio consists of various types of loans originated primarily as a result of lending opportunities within Peoples' primary market areas of northeastern, central, southwestern and southeastern Ohio, west central West Virginia, and northeastern Kentucky.  Acquired loans consist of loans purchased in 2012 or thereafter in a business combination.  The major classifications of loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, were as follows:  

Peoples has acquired various loans through business combinations for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination, and for which it was probable that all contractually required payments would not be collected.  The carrying amounts of these loans included in the loan balances above are summarized as follows:

Changes in the accretable yield for purchased credit impaired loans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Peoples completed semi-annual re-estimations of cash flows on acquired purchased credit impaired loans in February and August of 2016.  The above reclassification from nonaccretable to accretable was related to the re-estimation of cash flows on the acquired purchased credit impaired loan portfolios, coupled with the loans performing better than expected.  The majority of the reclassification related to prepayment speeds decreasing in the residential portfolio, resulting in higher total expected cash flows.  In 2017, Peoples will complete the re-estimation of cash flows on acquired purchased credit impaired loans on an as needed basis and, in any event, at least annually in August. 
  Cash flows expected to be collected on acquired purchased credit impaired loans are estimated by incorporating several key assumptions similar to the initial estimate of fair value.  These key assumptions include probability of default, and the amount of actual prepayments after the acquisition date.  Prepayments affect the estimated life of the loans and could change the amount of interest income, and possibly the principal expected to be collected.  In reforecasting future estimated cash flows, credit loss expectations are adjusted as necessary. 
  Peoples pledges certain loans secured by 1-4 family and multifamily residential mortgages under a blanket collateral agreement to secure borrowings from the FHLB.  The amount of such pledged loans totaled   $538.7 million   and   $554.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Peoples also pledges commercial loans to secure borrowings with the FRB.  The outstanding balances of these loans totaled   $159.9 million   and   $195.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans 
  A loan is considered past due if any required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were required to be made under the terms of the loan agreement.  A loan may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loan is considered past due.

Credit Quality Indicators 
  As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Peoples'   2015   Form 10-K, Peoples categorizes the majority of its loans into risk categories based upon an established risk grading matrix using a scale of 1 to 8.  A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades used by Peoples is as follows: 
   Pass  (grades 1 through 4):   Loans in this risk category involve borrowers of acceptable-to-strong credit quality and risk who have the apparent ability to satisfy their loan obligations.  Loans in this risk grade would possess sufficient mitigating factors, such as adequate collateral or strong guarantors possessing the capacity to repay the loan if required, for any weakness that may exist.   
   Watch  (grade 5):   Loans in this risk grade are the equivalent of the regulatory definition of  Other Assets Especially Mentioned  classification.  Loans in this category possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness, which requires a high level of management attention.  Potential weaknesses include declining trends in operating earnings and cash flows and/or reliance on the secondary source of repayment.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in noticeable deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in Peoples' credit position. 
   Substandard  (grade 6):   Loans in this risk grade are inadequately protected by the borrower's current financial condition and payment capability or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have one or more well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly repayment of the loan.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Peoples will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
   Doubtful  (grade 7):   Loans in this risk grade have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or orderly repayment in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  Possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the exposure, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. 

20 

     Table of Contents  

Loss  (grade 8):     Loans in this risk grade are considered to be non-collectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but rather it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off the loan, even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.  Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken in the period in which the loan becomes uncollectible.  Consequently, Peoples typically does not maintain a recorded investment in loans within this category.  
  Consumer loans and other smaller-balance loans are evaluated and categorized as  substandard ,  doubtful  or  loss  based upon the regulatory definition of these classes and consistent with regulatory requirements.  All other loans not evaluated individually, nor meeting the regulatory conditions to be categorized as described above, would be considered as being  not rated .

Impaired Loans 
  The following table summarizes loans classified as impaired: 

At   September 30, 2016  , Peoples' impaired loans shown in the table above included loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs").   
  In assessing whether or not a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, Peoples considers information currently available regarding the financial condition of the borrower.  This information includes, but is not limited to, whether (i) the borrower is currently in payment default on any of the borrower's debt; (ii) a payment default is probable in the foreseeable future without the modification; (iii) the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; and (iv) the borrower's projected cash flow is insufficient to satisfy contractual payments due under the original terms of the loan without a modification. 
   Peoples considers all aspects of the modification to loan terms to determine whether or not a concession has been granted to the borrower.  Key factors considered by Peoples include the borrower's ability to access funds at a market rate for debt with similar risk characteristics, the significance of the modification relative to the unpaid principal balance or collateral value of the debt, and the significance of a delay in the timing of payments relative to the original contractual terms of the loan.  The most common concessions granted by Peoples generally include one or more modifications to the terms of the loan, such as (i) a reduction in the interest rate for the remaining life of the loan, (ii) an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new loans with similar risk, (iii) a temporary period of interest-only payments, and (iv) a reduction in the contractual payment amount for either a short period or the remaining term of the loan.

Allowance for Originated Loan Losses 
  Changes in the allowance for originated loan losses for the nine months ended   September 30   were as follows:  

The reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and industrial recorded during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was driven by a decrease in the allowance needed for loans individually evaluated for impairment which was offset partially by loan growth.  The changes in the residential real estate, home equity lines of credit and consumer categories of the allowance for originated loan losses and the related provision for originated loan losses recorded during the nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 were driven by net charge-off activity and increases in the size of the respective loan portfolios.  
    
  Allowance for Acquired Loan Losses 
  Acquired loans are recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date with no valuation allowance, and monitored for changes in credit quality and subsequent increases or decreases in expected cash flows.  Decreases in expected cash flows of acquired credit impaired loans are recognized as an impairment, with the amount of the expected loss included in management's evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses.  The methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for nonimpaired acquired loans are similar to those utilized for originated loans; however, Peoples records a provision for loan losses only when the computed allowance exceeds the remaining fair value adjustment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the expected cash flows for acquired credit impaired loans had decreased from those as of the respective acquisition dates, resulting in Peoples recording provision for loan losses with respect to those acquired loans.

Note 5.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  
  Prior to 2016, Peoples performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30.  During 2016, Peoples changed its method in applying the accounting principle and will be completing the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 in 2016 and annually on that date thereafter.  This voluntary change is preferable as it aligns the goodwill impairment testing with the preparation of the underlying data used in the annual test, including financial and strategic information that is prepared late in the year.  This change is not intended to delay, accelerate or avoid any impairment charges.  This change is not applied retrospectively as it is impracticable to do so because retrospective application would require application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight.  Accordingly the change will be applied prospectively. 

Note 6.   Long-Term Borrowings 
  
  The following table summarizes Peoples' long-term borrowings:  

The putable, non-amortizing, fixed-rate FHLB advances have original maturities ranging from   two   to   eleven years   that may be repaid prior to maturity, subject to termination fees.  The FHLB has the option, solely at its discretion, to terminate the advances after the initial fixed rate periods ranging from   three months   to   five years  , requiring full repayment of the advances by Peoples, prior to the stated maturity.  If an advance is terminated prior to maturity, the FHLB will offer Peoples replacement funding at the then-prevailing rate on an advance product then offered by the FHLB, subject to normal FHLB credit and collateral requirements.  These advances require monthly interest payments, with no repayment of principal until the earlier of either an option exercise by the FHLB or the stated maturity.  The amortizing, fixed-rate FHLB advances have a fixed rate for the term of the loan, with maturities ranging from   two   to   fifteen years  .  These advances require monthly principal and interest payments, with some having a constant prepayment rate requiring an additional principal payment annually.  These advances are not eligible for optional prepayment prior to maturity.   
  Peoples continually evaluates the overall balance sheet position given the interest rate environment.  During the second quarter of 2016, Peoples executed transactions to take advantage of the low interest rates, which included:  
             
    Peoples restructured   $20.0   million of borrowings that had a weighted-average rate of   2.97%  , resulting in a   $700,000   loss.  Peoples replaced these borrowings with a long-term FHLB advance, which has an interest rate of   2.17%   and matures in 2026.

Additional information regarding Peoples' interest rate swaps can be found in Note 10 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Peoples' national market repurchase agreements consist of agreements with unrelated financial service companies and have original maturities ranging from   five   to   ten years  .  In general, these agreements may not be terminated by Peoples prior to maturity without incurring additional costs.  
  On March 6, 2015, Peoples acquired NB T Financial Group, Inc. ("NB T"), which included the assumption of Fixed/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due in 2037 (the "junior subordinated debt securities").  At the acquisition date, junior subordinated debt securities with a fair value of   $6.6 million   were held in a statutory trust whose common securities were wholly-owned by NB T.  The sole assets of the statutory trust are the junior subordinated debt securities and related payments.  The junior subordinated debt securities and the back-up obligations, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the statutory trust under the Capital Securities held by third-party investors.  Distributions on the Capital Securities are payable at the annual rate of   1.50%   over the 3-month LIBOR.  Distributions on the Capital Securities are included in interest expense in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.  These securities are considered Tier I capital (with certain limitations applicable) under current regulatory guidelines.  The junior subordinated debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Capital Securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the liquidation amount.  Subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve, the Capital Securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date of September 6, 2037, and are redeemable at par.  Since September 6, 2012, the Capital Securities have been redeemable at par.  Distributions on the Capital Securities can be deferred from time to time for a period not to exceed   20   consecutive semi-annual periods.  
  On March 4, 2016, Peoples entered into a Credit Agreement (the "RJB Credit Agreement"), with Raymond James Bank, N.A. ("Raymond James") which provides Peoples with a revolving line of credit in the maximum aggregate principal amount of   $15   million (the "RJB Loan Commitment") for the purpose of: (i) to the extent that any amounts remained outstanding, paying off the then outstanding   $15   million revolving credit loan to Peoples, (ii) making acquisitions; (iii) making stock repurchases; (iv) working capital needs; and (v) other general corporate purposes.  On March 4, 2016, Peoples paid fees of   $70,600  , representing   0.47%   of the RJB Loan Commitment.   
  The RJB Credit Agreement is unsecured.  However, the RJB Credit Agreement contains negative covenants which preclude Peoples from: (i) taking any action which could, directly or indirectly, decrease Peoples' ownership (alone or together with any of Peoples' subsidiaries) interest in Peoples Bank (Peoples' Ohio state-chartered subsidiary bank) or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries to a level below the percentage of equity interests held as of March 4, 2016; (ii) taking any action to or allowing Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries to take any action to directly or indirectly create, assume, incur, suffer or permit to exist any pledge, encumbrance, security interest, assignment, lien or charge of any kind or character on the equity interests of Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries; or (iii) taking any action to or allow Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries to sell, transfer, issue, reissue or exchange, or grant any option with respect to, any equity interest of Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries.  There are also negative covenants limiting the actions which may be taken with respect to the authorization or issuance of additional shares of any class of equity interests of Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries or the grant to any person other than Raymond James Bank of any proxy for existing equity interests of Peoples Bank or any of Peoples Bank's subsidiaries. 
  The RJB Credit Agreement contains covenants which are usual and customary for comparable transactions.  In addition to the negative covenants affecting the equity interests of Peoples Bank and Peoples Bank's subsidiaries discussed above, under the RJB Credit Agreement, the following covenants must be complied with:  
           (a) 
    neither Peoples nor any of its subsidiaries may create, incur or suffer to exist additional indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount which exceeds   $10   million at any time outstanding, subject to specific negotiated carve-outs; 
              (b) 
    neither Peoples nor any of its subsidiaries may be a party to certain material transactions (such as mergers or consolidations with third parties, liquidations or dissolutions, sales of assets, acquisitions, investments and sale/leaseback transactions), subject to transactions in the ordinary course of the banking business of  

29 

     Table of Contents  

Peoples Bank and new investments in an aggregate amount not exceeding   $10   million being permitted as well as specific negotiated carve-outs; 
           (c) 
    neither Peoples nor any of its subsidiaries may voluntarily prepay, defease, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any subordinated indebtedness issued by them; subject to specific negotiated carve-outs and the consent of Raymond James Bank; and 
              (d) 
    neither Peoples nor any of its subsidiaries may make any Restricted Payments (as defined in the RJB Credit Agreement), except that, to the extent legally permissible, (i) any subsidiary may declare and pay dividends to Peoples or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peoples and (ii) Peoples may declare and pay dividends on its common shares provided that no event of default exists before or after giving effect to the dividend and Peoples is in compliance (on a pro forma basis) with the financial covenants specified in the RJB Credit Agreement, after giving effect to the dividend. 
     Peoples and Peoples Bank are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants including: 
           (i) 
    Peoples (on a consolidated basis) and Peoples Bank must be  well capitalized  at all times, as defined and determined by the applicable governmental authority having jurisdiction over Peoples or Peoples Bank; 
              (ii) 
    Peoples (on a consolidated basis) and Peoples Bank must maintain a Total risk-based capital ratio (as defined by the applicable governmental authority having regulatory authority over Peoples or Peoples Bank) of at least   12.50%   as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; 
              (iii) 
    Peoples Bank  must maintain a ratio of  Non-Performing Assets  to  Tangible Primary Capital  of not more than   20%   as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; 
              (iv) 
    Peoples Bank must maintain a ratio of  Loan Loss Reserves  to  Non-Performing Loans  of not less than   70%   at all times; and 
              (v) 
    Peoples (on a consolidated basis) must maintain a  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  that equals or exceeds   1.25   to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter, with the items used in this ratio being determined on a trailing four-fiscal quarter basis. 
     The aggregate minimum annual retirements of long-term borrowings in future periods are as follows:

Note 8.       Employee Benefit Plans    
  
  Peoples sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all employees hired before January 1, 2010.  The plan provides retirement benefits based on an employee s years of service and compensation.  For employees hired before January 1, 2003, the amount of postretirement benefit is based on the employee s average monthly compensation over the highest   five   consecutive years out of the employee s last   ten years   with Peoples while an eligible employee.  For employees hired on or after January 1, 2003, the amount of postretirement benefit is based on   2%   of the employee s annual compensation plus accrued interest.  Effective January 1, 2010, the pension plan was closed to new entrants.  Effective March 1, 2011, the accrual of pension plan benefits for all participants was frozen.  Peoples recognized this freeze as a curtailment as of December 31, 2010 and March 1, 2011, under the terms of the pension plan.  Peoples also provides post-retirement health and life insurance benefits to former employees and directors.  Only those individuals who  

31 

     Table of Contents  

retired before January 27, 2012 were eligible for life insurance benefits.  As of January 1, 2011, all retirees who desire to participate in the Peoples Bank medical plan do so by electing COBRA, which provides up to 18 months of coverage; retirees over the age of 65 also have the option to pay to participate in a group Medicare supplemental plan.  Peoples  policy is to fund the cost of the health benefits as they arise. 
  The following tables detail the components of the net periodic cost for the plans:

Note 10.   Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
  
  Derivatives and Hedging Activities - Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  Peoples is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  Peoples principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.  Peoples manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and through the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, Peoples enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known or expected cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Peoples  derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of Peoples' known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate borrowings.  Peoples also has interest rate derivatives that result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in Peoples' assets or liabilities.  Peoples manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.       
  Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet   
  Peoples' fair value of the derivative financial instrument was   $6.9 million   in an asset position and   $7.1 million   in a liability position at September 30, 2016, and there was   $3.1 million   in an asset position and   $3.1 million   in a liability position at December 31, 2015.   
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  Peoples' objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense, and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, in the second quarter of 2016, Peoples entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and involved the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Peoples making fixed payments.  As of September 30, 2016, Peoples had three interest rate swaps with a notional value of   $30 million   associated with Peoples' cash outflows for various FHLB advances.   
  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") (outside of earnings), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.  Peoples assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transaction.   
  Peoples hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of   25 months   (excluding forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments).  Peoples entered into three interest rate swap contracts whereby Peoples will pay a fixed rate of interest for up to seven years while receiving a floating rate component of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR rate.  The received floating rate component is intended to offset the rate on the rolling three-month FHLB advances that will be used to fund the transaction. 
  Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income or expense as interest payments are made or received on Peoples' variable-rate assets or liabilities.  During the quarters ended September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, Peoples had   no   reclassifications to interest expense.  During the next twelve months, Peoples estimates that   no   interest expense amount will be reclassified. 
  The amount of accumulated other comprehensive pre-tax income for Peoples' cash flow hedges was   $68,000   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the amount of accumulated other comprehensive pre-tax loss was   $184,000   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  There were   no   pre-tax net losses recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, Peoples had   no   reclassifications to earnings in the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  .  
  Non-Designated Hedges 
  Peoples maintains an interest rate protection program for commercial loan customers, which was established in 2010.  Under this program, Peoples provides its customer with a fixed-rate loan while creating a variable-rate asset for Peoples by the customer entering into an interest rate swap with Peoples on terms that match the loan.  Peoples offsets its risk exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an unaffiliated institution.  These interest rate swaps do not qualify as designated hedges; therefore, each swap is accounted for as a standalone derivative.  Peoples had interest rate swaps associated with commercial loans with a notional value of   $238.6 million   and fair value of   $6.9 million   of equally offsetting assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 and a notional value of   $144.4 million   and fair value of   $3.1 million   of equally  

33 

     Table of Contents  

offsetting assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015.  These interest rate swaps did not have a material impact on Peoples' results of operation or financial condition. 
   
  Note 11.   Stock-Based Compensation  
  
  Under the Peoples Bancorp Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Plan (the "2006 Equity Plan"), Peoples may grant, among other awards, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and unrestricted share awards to employees and non-employee directors.  The total number of common shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan is   1,081,260  .  The maximum number of common shares that can be issued for incentive stock options is   800,000   common shares.  Prior to 2007, Peoples granted nonqualified and incentive stock options to employees and nonqualified stock options to non-employee directors under the 2006 Equity Plan and predecessor plans.  Since 2009, Peoples has granted restricted common shares to employees and restricted common shares to non-employee directors subject to the terms and conditions prescribed by the 2006 Equity Plan.  In general, common shares issued in connection with stock-based awards are issued from treasury shares to the extent available.  If no treasury shares are available, common shares are issued from authorized but unissued common shares. 
  Stock Options 
  Under the provisions of the 2006 Equity Plan and predecessor stock option plans, the exercise price per share of any stock option granted may not be less than the grant date fair market value of the underlying common shares.  All stock options granted to both employees and non-employee directors expire   ten years   from the date of grant.  The most recent stock option grants to employees and non-employee directors occurred in 2006.  The stock options granted to employees vested   three years   after the grant date, while the stock options granted to non-employee directors vested   six months   after the grant date.  The following table summarizes the changes to Peoples' stock options for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock Appreciation Rights 
  SARs granted to employees have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Peoples  common shares on the date of grant and will be settled using common shares of Peoples.  Additionally, the SARs granted to employees vested   three years   after the grant date and are to expire   ten years   from the date of grant.  The most recent grant of SARs occurred in 2008.  The following table summarizes the changes to Peoples' SARs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

Restricted Common Shares 
     Under the 2006 Equity Plan, Peoples may award restricted common shares to officers, key employees and non-employee directors.  In general, the restrictions on restricted common shares awarded to non-employee directors expire after   six months  , while the restrictions on restricted common shares awarded to employees expire after periods ranging from   one   to   three years  .  In the first quarter of 2016, Peoples granted an aggregate of   35,500   restricted common shares subject to performance-based vesting to officers and key employees with restrictions that will lapse three years after the grant date provided that in order for the restricted common shares to vest in full, Peoples must have reported positive net income and maintained a well capitalized status by regulatory standards for each of the three fiscal years preceding the vesting date.  In the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2016, Peoples granted, to certain key employees, an aggregate of   20,500   restricted common shares subject to time-based vesting with restrictions that will lapse three years after the grant date.  
  The following table summarizes the changes to Peoples  restricted common shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the total intrinsic value of restricted common shares released was $  0.7 million   compared to $  1.7 million   at September 30, 2015. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Peoples recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is included as a component of Peoples' salaries and employee benefit costs, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date.  The following table summarizes the amount of stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefit recognized for each period: 

Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested awards was $  1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.7   years.

     All forward-looking statements speak only as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements.  Although management believes the expectations in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of management s knowledge of Peoples  business and operations, it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these projections.  Additionally, Peoples undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the filing date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as may be required by applicable legal requirements.  Copies of documents filed with the SEC are available free of charge at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and/or from Peoples' website   www.peoplesbancorp.com under the  Investor Relations  section. 
  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes thereto, contained in Peoples    2015   Form 10-K, as well as the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, ratios, statistics and discussions contained elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
  Business Overview 
  The following discussion and analysis of Peoples  Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of the financial condition and results of operations. 
  Peoples offers diversified financial products and services through 80 financial service locations, including 73 full-service bank branches, and 80 Automated Teller Machines ("ATMs") in northeastern, central, southwestern and southeastern Ohio, west central West Virginia and northeastern Kentucky through its financial service units   Peoples Bank and Peoples Insurance Agency, LLC ("Peoples Insurance"), a subsidiary of Peoples Bank.  Peoples Bank is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (the "ODFI") and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.  Peoples Bank is also subject to regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the FDIC.  Peoples Insurance is subject to regulation by the Ohio Department of Insurance and the state insurance regulatory agencies of those states in which it may do business. 
  Peoples  products and services include traditional banking products, such as deposit accounts, lending products and trust services.  Peoples provides services through traditional offices, ATMs, mobile banking for consumers and telephone and internet-based banking.  Peoples also offers a complete array of insurance products and makes available custom-tailored

     Table of Contents  

fiduciary, employee benefit plan and asset management services.  Brokerage services are offered by Peoples exclusively through an unaffiliated registered broker-dealer. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The accounting and reporting policies of Peoples conform to US GAAP and to general practices within the financial services industry.  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  Management has identified the accounting policies that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to understanding Peoples  Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management s Discussion and Analysis at   September 30, 2016  , which were unchanged from the policies disclosed in Peoples    2015   Form 10-K. 
   Summary of Recent Transactions and Events 
  The following is a summary of recent transactions and events that have impacted or are expected to impact Peoples  results of operations or financial condition:  
             
    In the fourth quarter of 2016, Peoples will be upgrading its core banking system (including the related operating systems, data systems and products).  Peoples anticipates one-time costs associated with the upgrade of approximately $1.4 million.  The costs recorded in the third quarter and second quarter of 2016 were $423,000 and $90,000, respectively, with the remaining costs expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The core banking system upgrade will support Peoples' future growth, and will provide efficiencies for the back-office areas.  
                
    Peoples continually evaluates the overall balance sheet position given the interest rate environment.  During the second quarter of 2016, Peoples executed transactions to take advantage of the low interest rates, which included:  
                
    Peoples restructured $20.0 million of borrowings that had a weighted-average rate of 2.97%, resulting in a $700,000 loss.  Peoples replaced these borrowings with a long-term FHLB advance, which has an interest rate of 2.17% and matures in 2026.  
                    
    Effective March 2, 2016, Peoples terminated the loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association dated as of December 18, 2012, as amended (the "U.S. Bank Loan Agreement").  As of the termination date, Peoples had no outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement.  Peoples paid an immaterial non-usage fee in connection with the termination of the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement. 
                
    On March 4, 2016, Peoples entered into a Credit Agreement (the "RBJ Credit Agreement") with Raymond James Bank, N.A., which provides Peoples with a revolving line of credit in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $15 million, for the purpose of: (i) to the extent that any amounts remained then outstanding, paying off the $15 million revolving line of credit to Peoples pursuant to the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement; (ii) making acquisitions; (iii) making stock repurchases; (iv) working capital needs; and (v) other general corporate purposes.  On March 4, 2016, Peoples paid fees of   $70,600  , representing   0.47%   of the loan commitment under the RJB Credit Agreement.  
                
    On January 6, 2016, Peoples Bank acquired a small financial advisory book of business in Marietta, Ohio for total cash consideration of $0.5 million, and recorded $0.5 million of customer relationship intangibles.  The acquisition did not materially impact Peoples' financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
                
    On July 24, 2015, Peoples repaid the $12.0 million term loan then outstanding under the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement.  There were no early termination fees associated with the repayment.  The revolving credit loan commitment available under the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement remained outstanding until the March 2, 2016 termination date of the U.S. Bank Loan Agreement.

At the close of business on March 6, 2015, Peoples completed the acquisition of NB T and the 22 full-service offices of its wholly owned subsidiary, The National Bank and Trust Company, in southwestern Ohio.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Peoples paid 0.9319 in Peoples' common shares and $7.75 in cash for each common share of NB T, or total consideration of $102.7 million.  The acquisition added $384.6 million of loans and $629.5 million of deposits at the acquisition date. 
                
    In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Peoples recorded $0.1 million and $9.9 million of non-core acquisition expenses, respectively.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, non-core acquisition charges included $4.3 million of salaries and employee benefit costs, $3.9 million of other non-interest expense, and $1.7 million of professional fees, respectively.  
                
    Peoples' net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by changes in market interest rates based upon actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board, either directly or through its Open Market Committee.  These actions include changing its target Federal Funds Rate (the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other), Discount Rate (the interest rate charged to banks for money borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank) and longer-term market interest rates (primarily U.S. Treasury securities).  Longer-term market interest rates also are affected by the demand for U.S. Treasury securities.  The resulting changes in the yield curve slope have a direct impact on reinvestment rates for Peoples' earning assets.  
                
    Market participants have been speculating on when the Federal Reserve might follow up its December 2015 rate increase with more tightening of monetary policy.  Additional rate increases were widely anticipated in early 2016. However, global developments have dampened these expectations.  In June of 2016, Great Britain voters opted to exit the European Union which caused a spike in market volatility.  Also, it is estimated that over $10 trillion in sovereign debt is now trading at negative yields.  Peoples is closely monitoring interest rates, both foreign and domestic, and potential impacts to Peoples' operations. 
     The impact of these transactions and events, where material, is discussed in the applicable sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
   
  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  Peoples recorded net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $7.8 million  , or   $0.43   per diluted common share, compared to   $4.1 million  , or   $0.22   per diluted common share, a year ago and net income of $8.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2016.  On a year-to-date basis, net income was $23.7 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to $8.4 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the same period in 2015.  The increases in earnings for all periods were related to the increases in net interest income and other income, and a decrease in expenses. 
  Net interest income was   $26.1 million   for the third quarter of 2016, compared to   $25.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   and $26.3 million for the second quarter of 2016, while net interest margin was   3.54%  ,   3.55%   and 3.57%, respectively.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income was $78.2 million, compared to $71.7 million for the same period in 2015, while net interest margin was 3.55% and 3.49%, respectively. 
  The slight decline in net interest margin from prior periods was driven primarily by decreases in the yield on investments and loans offset partially by decreases in the cost of funds.  The accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions added 10 basis points to net interest margin in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 18 basis points for the third quarter of 2015 and 12 basis points for the linked quarter.  On a year-to-date basis, accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions added 12 basis points to net interest margin for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 17 basis points for the first nine months of 2015.  For the first nine months ended September 30, 2016, the higher net interest margin was the result of the sustained shift in the mix of the balance sheet, for both assets and liabilities, coupled with the restructuring of borrowings during the second quarter of 2016.  
  Peoples' provision for loan losses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.1 million  , compared to $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2016.  For the first nine months of 2016, the provision for loan losses totaled $2.8 million compared to $6.9 million in the same period of 2015.  Recent loan growth was the main driver of the provision for loan losses recorded during the third quarter and the nine months of 2016.  The provision for loan losses recorded in the third quarter of 2015 was driven primarily by an increase to the specific reserve for a large commercial loan relationship that was charged-off in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans was 1.13% at September 30, 2016, down slightly from 1.16% at June 30, 2016.  Asset quality metrics were relatively stable during the third quarter 2016.  Annualized net charge-offs were 0.14% of average gross loans during the third quarter of 2016, compared to 0.15% in the third quarter of 2015 and 0.03% in the linked quarter.  During the

     Table of Contents  

first nine months of 2016, annualized net charge-offs were 0.09% of average gross loans compared to 0.10% in the same period of 2015.   
  For the third quarter of 2016, total other income increased $1.4 million, or 12%, compared to third quarter of 2015, and $0.09 million, or 8%, from the linked quarter.  The increases compared to the third quarter of 2015 and the linked quarter were due primarily to increases in commercial loan swap fee income, BOLI income and electronic banking income.  Also contributing to the growth compared to the linked quarter was an increase in deposit account service charges.  The increase compared to the third quarter of 2015 included the growth of mortgage banking income.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total other income increased $4.1 million, or 12%, primarily due to increases in electronic banking income, trust and investment income, commercial loan swap fee income and BOLI income, with a portion of the growth attributable to the NB T acquisition.  The increase in BOLI income was the result of the additional $35.0 million of BOLI policies that were purchased in the second quarter of 2016.    
  Total other expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $26.8 million, compared to $26.1 million during the third quarter of 2015 and $26.5 million for the second quarter of 2016.  Total other expenses increased from the third quarter of 2015 due largely to increased salaries and employee benefit costs coupled with an increase in professional fees during the third quarter of 2016.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, non-core charges included one-time costs associated with the system upgrade of Peoples core banking system (including the related operating systems, data systems and products).  These costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 million for the full year of 2016.  During the second and third quarter of 2016, these non-core charges were $90,000 and $423,000, respectively. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, salaries and employee benefits increased compared to both the third quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2016.  The increase in salaries and employee benefits compared to the third quarter of 2015 was due primarily to increased sales-based and incentive compensation as a result of the corporate incentive plan.  The increase in salaries and employee benefits compared to the second quarter of 2016 was due primarily to increased medical costs as a result of higher claims, and higher sales-based and incentive compensation as a result of performance. 
  For the first nine months ended September 30, 2016, other expense was $79.6 million, a decrease of 9% from $87.8 million for the first nine months of 2015.  The decline was largely due to acquisition expenses from the NB T acquisition recognized in the first nine months of 2015.  Peoples' number of full-time equivalent employees declined to 799 at September 30, 2016, compared to 803 at June 30, 2016 and 821 at September 30, 2015.   
  Peoples' efficiency ratio, calculated as total other expense (less amortization of other intangible assets) as a percentage of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income for the third quarter of 2016 was 64.33%, compared to 65.81% for the third quarter of 2015 and 65.08% for the linked quarter.  The lower efficiency ratios in the periods reported were primarily due to continued revenue growth and the focus on expense management.  Revenue grew 6% and core expenses grew 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015 and 3% and 2%, respectively, compared to the linked quarter of 2016.  For the first nine months of 2016, the efficiency ratio was 64.56% compared to 78.18% for the first nine months of 2015.  The improvement in the efficiency ratio during the first nine months of 2016 versus the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased revenues coupled with decreases in expenses.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , total assets were $  3.4 billion  , up $104.6 million or 3%, from year-end   2015  .  The increase was primarily the result of increases in loan balances, net of deferred fees and costs, of $96.8 million, or 5%, and an increase of $35 million in BOLI, offset partially by a decrease in investment securities.  The increase in loans was driven primarily by growth of $66.7 million in consumer loan balances, coupled with a $48.3 million increase in commercial and industrial loans.  The decrease in investment securities was due primarily to the sale of $28.9 million of available-for-sale securities for a gain of $767,000 in the second quarter of 2016 coupled with the decrease in fair market value at September 30, 2016. 
  Quarterly average gross loan balances increased $12.0 million, or 2% annualized, compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to indirect lending.  The increase in commercial loan balances previously noted was largely recorded late in the quarter and did not have a significant impact on the quarterly average balances.  Compared to the third quarter of 2015, average gross loans increased $106.7 million, or 5%, largely due to growth in indirect lending and commercial and industrial loans.  During the first nine months of 2016, average gross loan balances grew $200.1 million, or 10%, compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to the NB T acquisition, and higher indirect lending and commercial and industrial loan balances. 
  Total liabilities were $  2.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , up $83.8 million since year-end 2015.  The increase in liabilities was primarily due to a 2% increase in deposits, or $39.5 million, coupled with a 13%, or $36.3 million, increase in total borrowed funds.  Total non-interest-bearing deposits increased 4%, or $27.5 million, and interest-bearing deposits increased 1%, or $12.0 million, from December 31, 2015.  The growth in interest-bearing deposits was the result of growth in all categories except for certificates of deposit, which decreased $59.3 million.

During the third quarter of 2016, period-end deposits increased $42.5 million, attributable to an increase of $45.8 million in non-interest-bearing deposits.  The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to commercial non-interest-bearing deposit balances, which increased $36.0 million, while individual non-interest-bearing deposit balances increased $12.0 million during the quarter.  Commercial non-interest-bearing deposit balances were impacted by one large customer maintaining a higher than normal balance on September 30, 2016.  
  Non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 29% of total deposits at September 30, 2016, compared to 28% at each of June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015. 
  Average deposits for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $24.2 million compared to the linked quarter, with a decline of $16.6 million in non-interest-bearing deposits and $7.6 million in interest-bearing deposits.  Compared to the third quarter of 2015, average deposits increased $12.1 million, with non-interest-bearing deposits increasing $15.2 million and interest-bearing deposits declining $3.1 million.  For the first nine months of 2016, average deposits increased $162.5 million, or 7% compared to the first nine months of 2015, mainly due to the NB T acquisition.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , total stockholders' equity was $  440.6 million  , up $20.8 million since   December 31, 2015  .  Regulatory capital ratios remained significantly higher than "well capitalized" minimums.  Peoples' tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 13.04% at September 30, 2016, versus 13.03% at June 30, 2016, 13.36% at December 31, 2015 and 13.45% at September 30, 2015, while the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was   13.34%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 13.33% at June 30, 2016, 13.67% at   December 31, 2015   and 13.77% at September 30, 2015.  The total risk-based capital ratio was   14.24%    at September 30, 2016, compared to 14.23% at June 30, 2016, 14.54% at   December 31, 2015   and 14.97% at September 30, 2015.  In addition, Peoples' tangible equity to tangible asset ratio was   9.13%  , and tangible book value per common share was   $16.14   at   September 30, 2016  , versus 8.69% and $14.68 at   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The slight decline in Peoples' capital ratios from December 31, 2015, was due primarily to an increase in risk-weighted assets, which was the result of growth in loan balances, BOLI and low income housing investments, coupled with stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2016, totaling $5.0 million.    

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income, the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense, remains Peoples' largest source of revenue.  The amount of net interest income earned by Peoples each quarter is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board s monetary policy, the level and degree of pricing competition for both loans and deposits in Peoples  markets, and the amount and composition of Peoples' earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(1)  
    Average balances are based on carrying value. 
              (2)  
    Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 35% federal tax rate. 
              (3)  
    Average balances include nonaccrual and impaired loans.  Interest income includes interest earned and received on nonaccrual loans prior to the loans being placed on nonaccrual status. Loan fees included in interest income were immaterial for all periods presented.

     Table of Contents  

(4)  
    Loans held for sale are included in the average loan balance listed.  Related interest income on loans originated for sale prior to the loan being sold is included in loan interest income. 
      
  The following table provides an analysis of the changes in FTE net interest income: 

(1)  The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the 
  relationship of the dollar amounts of the changes in each. 
  (2)  Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 35% federal tax rate.  
  Net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing fully tax-equivalent ("FTE") net interest income by average interest-earning assets, serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume, mix and pricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  FTE net interest income is calculated by increasing interest income to convert tax-exempt income earned on obligations of states and political subdivisions to the pre-tax equivalent of taxable income using a 35% federal tax rate.   

45 

     Table of Contents  

The following table details the calculation of FTE net interest income: 

Net interest income declined slightly in the third quarter of 2016, mostly due to lower income from investment securities.  Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 3.54% compared to 3.55% for the third quarter of 2015 and 3.57% in the second quarter of 2016.  During the third quarter of 2016, net interest income and net interest margin benefited from normal accretion income, net of amortization expense, of $0.8 million related primarily to the acquired loans purchased in 2012 or thereafter in a business combination, which added 10 basis points to net interest margin, compared to $0.9 million, or 12 basis points, during the linked quarter and $1.4 million, or 18 basis points, during the prior year third quarter. 
  The net interest margin, excluding the impact of amortization and accretion from the acquisitions completed, decreased by 1 basis point compared to the linked quarter.  Funding costs decreased 1 basis point compared to the linked quarter and 2 basis points from the third quarter of 2015.  Peoples continues to execute its strategy of replacing higher-cost funding with low-cost deposits. 
  Additional information regarding changes in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets can be found under appropriate captions of the  FINANCIAL CONDITION  section of this discussion.  Additional information regarding Peoples' interest rate risk and the potential impact of interest rate changes on Peoples' results of operations and financial condition can be found later in this discussion under the caption "Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity". 
   
  Provision for Loan Losses 
  The following table details Peoples  provision for loan losses: 

The provision for loan losses recorded represents the amount needed to maintain the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on management s quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and procedural methodology that estimates the amount of probable credit losses.  This process considers various factors that affect losses, such as changes in Peoples  loan quality, historical loss experience and current economic conditions.  The provisions recorded in the current quarter and linked quarter were primarily due to loan growth.  The provision for loan losses recorded during the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to increased loan growth, an increase in criticized loans and an increase in a specific reserve related to one commercial relationship.  During the first nine months of 2016, net charge-offs remained below the long-term historical average of 20 to 30 basis points. 
  Additional information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses and loan credit quality can be found later in this discussion under the caption  Allowance for Loan Losses .

Table of Contents  

Net Loss on Asset Disposals and Other Transactions 
  The following table details the net loss on asset disposals and other transactions recognized by Peoples: 

The net loss on other during the third quarter of 2016 was related to the write-down of a tax investment.  The net loss on debt extinguishment during the second quarter of 2016 was related to the prepayment of $20.0 million of FHLB advances.  The net loss on bank premises and equipment during the second quarter of 2016 was due mainly to the closing of a leased office and related disposal of leasehold improvements.  The net loss on other real estate owned ("OREO") during the third quarter of 2015 was due to the sale of one OREO property and the write-off of another OREO property.  During the first nine months of 2015, the net loss on debt extinguishment was due to Peoples recognizing a loss from the prepayment of several FHLB advances and the loss on bank premises and equipment was due to asset write-offs associated with the NB T acquisition, write-off of obsolete fixed assets and the write-down of a closed office location that was available for sale.  
   
  Non-Interest Income 
  Insurance income comprised the largest portion of   third   quarter 2016 non-interest income.  The following table details Peoples' insurance income: 

The decrease in revenue for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the linked quarter was due mainly to a decline in the value of assets insured by Peoples' clients, which results in lower premiums to the clients and lower commission income to Peoples. 
  Deposit account service charges continued to comprise a sizable portion of Peoples' non-interest income.  The following table details Peoples' deposit account service charges: 

The amount of deposit account service charges, particularly fees for overdrafts and non-sufficient funds, is largely dependent on the timing and volume of customer activity.  Peoples typically experiences a lower volume of overdraft and  

47 

     Table of Contents  

non-sufficient funds fees annually in the first quarter attributable to customers receiving income tax refunds, while volumes generally increase in the fourth quarter in connection with the holiday shopping season. 
  Peoples' electronic banking services include ATM and debit cards, direct deposit services, internet and mobile banking, and remote deposit capture, which serve as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients.  During the third quarter of 2016, compared to the prior year third quarter, electronic banking income grew 23% and has grown 20% in the nine months of 2016 compared to the nine months of 2015.  The continued growth was primarily due to the increased volume of debit card transactions and ATM surcharges, due partly to the NB T acquisition.   
  Peoples' trust and investment revenue continues to be based primarily upon the value of assets under management, with additional income generated from transaction commissions.  The following tables detail Peoples  trust and investment income and related assets under management: 

Mortgage banking income increased 61% compared to the linked quarter, due to higher customer demand for long-term fixed-rate real estate loans which increased sales of loans in the secondary market.  Peoples sold approximately $22.9 million of loans to the secondary market in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $15.7 million in the linked quarter.  In the first nine months of 2016, Peoples sold approximately $44.6 million of loans to the secondary market compared to $41.1 million in the first nine months of 2015.  
   
  Non-Interest Expense 
  Salaries and employee benefit costs remain Peoples' largest non-interest expense, accounting for over one-half of total non-interest expense.  The following table details Peoples' salaries and employee benefit costs: 

48 

     Table of Contents  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and employee benefit costs increased $1.0 million compared to the prior year third quarter and $612,000 from the linked quarter.  The increases from the prior year third quarter and the linked quarter related to increases in sales-based and incentive compensation due largely to the corporate incentive plan.  The decrease from the prior year-to-date period related to severance and retention payouts associated with the NB T acquisition which were included in base salaries and wages in 2015.  
  Peoples' net occupancy and equipment expense was comprised of the following: 

Professional fees increased $374,000 during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year third quarter but decreased $462,000 from the linked quarter.  The increase in professional fees during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year third quarter was mostly due to higher legal expenses, while the decrease from the linked quarter was related to annual trust client tax preparation, fees for outsourced services and the completion of a consulting agreement in the second quarter of 2016.  Professional fees decreased $299,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior year-to-date, as a result of acquisition-related activities in the first nine months of 2015 compared to no such activities in the first nine months of 2016.  
  Electronic banking expense, which is comprised of bankcard, internet and mobile banking costs, has increased from the prior year third quarter and the linked quarter, and from the prior year-to-date period.  The increases from the prior periods were largely related to a higher volume of transactions completed by customers and additional services provided.  The increase in the electronic banking expense was directionally consistent with the growth in electronic banking income.     
  Marketing expense decreased $983,000 from the prior year-to-date period, which was related to the timing of the NB T acquisition and additional marketing campaigns in the new market areas.  
  Foreclosed real estate and other loan expenses decreased $491,000 from prior year-to-date, largely due to the timing of loan originations and the related deferral of the loan origination costs.  
  Other non-interest expense decreased $4.5 million for the first nine months in 2016 compared to the first nine months in 2015.  The decrease was driven by $3.7 million of acquisition-related costs incurred in the 2015 period, compared to none in the 2016 period. 
   
  Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Peoples recorded income tax expense of $  10.8 million  , for an effective tax rate of 31.2%.  Peoples' current estimate of the effective tax rate for the entire year of 2016 is between 30.0% and 32.0%.  In comparison, Peoples recorded an income tax expense of   $3.5 million   for the same period in   2015  , which included the tax impact of acquisition-related costs that are not tax deductible of approximately $165,000, for an effective tax rate of 29.2%.  The lower effective tax rate in 2015 was due primarily to lower book income in 2015 compared to 2016. 
   
  Pre-Provision Net Revenue 
  Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR") has become a key financial measure used by state and federal bank regulatory agencies when assessing the capital adequacy of financial institutions.  PPNR is defined as net interest income plus non-interest income minus total other expenses and, therefore, excludes the provision for loan losses and all gains and losses included in earnings.  As a result, PPNR represents the earnings capacity that can be either retained in order to build capital or used to absorb unexpected losses and preserve existing capital. 

49 

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported for income before taxes in Peoples' consolidated financial statements for the periods presented:       
     
  PPNR for the third quarter of 2016 was higher than the linked quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 due largely to the increased revenue.  PPNR for the first nine months of 2016 increased compared to the prior year-to-date period due largely to a reduction in acquisition-related costs and increased revenue.  
   
  Efficiency Ratio 
  The efficiency ratio is a key financial measure used to monitor performance.  The efficiency ratio is calculated as total other expenses (less amortization of other intangible assets) as a percentage of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income.  This measure is non-GAAP since it excludes amortization of other intangible assets and all gains and/or losses included in earnings, and uses FTE net interest income.  
  The following table provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' consolidated financial statements for the periods presented: 

The decreases in the efficiency ratio in the periods disclosed above were primarily due to increased revenues and the continued focus on expense management.  Management continues to target an efficiency ratio of 65% absent acquisition-related costs and other non-core charges, such as pension settlement charges.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Peoples' interest-bearing deposits in other banks decreased from   December 31, 2015  , as excess cash was utilized to fund loan growth.  These balances included $6.0 million of excess cash reserves being maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2016 and $8.7 million at   December 31, 2015  .  The amount of excess cash reserves maintained is dependent upon Peoples' daily liquidity position, which is driven primarily by changes in deposit and loan balances. 
  Through the first   nine   months of   2016  , Peoples' total cash and cash equivalents decreased   $3.3 million  , as cash used in investing activities of   $107.0 million   exceeded cash provided by financing and operating activities of   $61.6 million   and   $42.2 million  , respectively.  Peoples' investing activities reflected a   $94.1 million   net increase in loans and   $35.0 million   in BOLI, offset partially by $30.1 million in net proceeds from investment activities.  The net proceeds from the investment portfolio reflected sales and principal payments, which outpaced purchases.  Financing activities included a net increase in borrowings of $35.5 million and an increase of $39.6 million in deposits which were offset partially by cash dividends paid of   $8.2 million   and the purchase of   $5.0 million   of treasury stock. 
  Through the first nine months of 2015, Peoples' total cash and cash equivalents increased $2.3 million, as cash provided by operating and investing activities of $31.1 million and $39.2 million, respectively, exceeded cash used in financing activities totaling $68.0 million.  The increase in cash provided by Peoples investing activities was primarily due to the $97.3 million contributed by the NB T acquisition.  Peoples financing activities reflected declines of $31.3 million in deposits and net payments of $28.8 million on long-term borrowings. 
  Further information regarding the management of Peoples' liquidity position can be found later in this discussion under  Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity.  
   
  Investment Securities  
  The following table provides information regarding Peoples  investment portfolio: 

The decline in available-for-sale investment securities during the third quarter of 2016, compared to at June 30, 2016, was due to principal paydowns outpacing the reinvestment of cash into the portfolio, coupled with declines in market values.   

51 

     Table of Contents  

At September 30, 2016, the investment portfolio was 25.1% of total assets, compared to 27.2% a year ago.  In recent quarters, Peoples has maintained the size of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio, for which the unrealized gain or loss does not directly impact stockholders' equity, in contrast to the impact from the available-for-sale securities portfolio. 
  Peoples' investment in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities largely consists of securities either guaranteed by the U.S. government or issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The remaining portions of Peoples' mortgage-backed securities consist of securities issued by other entities, including other financial institutions, which are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.  
  The amount of these  non-agency  securities included in the residential mortgage-backed securities totals above was as follows:  

Management continues to reinvest the principal runoff from the non-agency securities into U.S. agency investments, which accounted for the decline in the past year.  At   September 30, 2016  , Peoples' non-agency portfolio consisted entirely of first lien residential mortgages, with nearly all of the underlying loans in these securities originated prior to 2004 and possessing fixed interest rates.  Management continues to monitor the non-agency portfolio closely for leading indicators of increasing stress and will continue to be proactive in taking actions to mitigate such risk when necessary.

Loans 
  The following table provides information regarding outstanding loan balances: 

(a) 
    Includes all loans acquired, and related loan discount recorded as part of acquisition accounting, in 2012 and thereafter. 
     For the third quarter of 2016, period-end total loan balances increased $40.4 million, or 8% annualized, compared to at June 30, 2016.  Period-end total loan balances increased $119.0 million, or 6%, compared to September 30, 2015.  Indirect lending balances continued to be a key component of loan growth as they increased $23.2 million, or 45% annualized, during the quarter, and for the nine months ended 2016, indirect loans grew $63.2 million, or 50% annualized.  Commercial loans grew $23.7 million, or 8% annualized, during the quarter, with the majority of the increase being in commercial and industrial loans, which grew $21.7 million, or 23% annualized, from the linked quarter.  Indirect lending comprised a larger portion of the consumer loan portfolio as it was 24% at September 30, 2016, compared to 22% at June 30, 2016, 18% at December 31, 2015 and 17% at September 30, 2015.  In addition, commercial and industrial loan balances comprised 33% of the commercial portfolio at September 30, 2016, compared to 32% at June 30, 2016, 30% at December 31, 2015 and 31% at  

53 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2015.  The recent growth in indirect lending and commercial and industrial loan balances has provided additional diversification to the loan portfolio. 
  Loan Concentration 
  Peoples categorizes its commercial loans according to standard industry classifications and monitors for concentrations in a single industry or multiple industries that could be impacted by changes in economic conditions in a similar manner. Peoples' commercial lending activities continue to be spread over a diverse range of businesses from all sectors of the economy, with no single industry comprising over 10% of Peoples' total loan portfolio. 
  Loans secured by commercial real estate, including commercial construction loans, continue to comprise the largest portion of Peoples' loan portfolio.  The following table provides information regarding the largest concentrations of commercial real estate loans within the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  : 

54 

     Table of Contents  

Peoples' commercial lending activities continue to focus on lending opportunities inside its primary and secondary market areas within Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.  In all other states, the aggregate outstanding balances of commercial loans in each state were less than $4.0 million at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The amount of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each period represents management's estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon its quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio. While this process involves allocations being made to specific loans and pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for all losses incurred within the loan portfolio.   

55 

     Table of Contents  

The following details management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses: 

The increase in the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016, compared to the linked quarter and December 31, 2015 was largely due to loan growth during the year.  The coverage of allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 decreased from December 31, 2015 primarily due to continued improvement in the historical loss experience used to calculate the allowance for loan losses, coupled with the continued stabilization of asset quality metrics.  The decrease in the coverage of allowance for loan losses from September 30, 2015 was due to the specific reserve on the one commercial loan relationship that was charged-off in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
  The significant allocations to commercial loans reflect the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and the size of this loan category in relationship to the entire loan portfolio.  The allowance allocated to the residential real estate and consumer loan categories is based upon Peoples' allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans. The fluctuations in these allocations have been directionally consistent with the changes in loan quality, loss experience and loan balances in these categories.  

56 

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes Peoples  net charge-offs and recoveries: 

Net charge-offs were below Peoples' historical rate of 20 to 30 basis points in 2016.  Peoples recorded net charge-offs of $765,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in an annualized net charge-off rate of   0.14%  . The increase in consumer net charge-offs was in relation to the increase in indirect lending portfolio, which has experienced significant growth during the year.  The commercial and industrial loan recovery during the second quarter of 2016 was due to a single commercial relationship that was previously charged-off.  The commercial real estate loan recovery during the first quarter of 2016 was due to a $1.0 million recovery on a relationship that was previously charged-off.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, Peoples recorded a $13.1 million charge-off of one commercial and industrial loan relationship.  These factors have an impact on the estimated loss rates used to determine the allocations of allowance for loan losses for commercial loans.

     Table of Contents  

The following table details Peoples  nonperforming assets:  

Nonperforming assets increased $2.1 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to June 30, 2016, due primarily to an increase of $3.8 million in nonaccrual loans, which was partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in loans 90+ days past due.  The increase in nonaccrual loans was due primarily to two commercial real estate loans.  The increase of $0.8 million in total nonperforming assets during the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the increase in loans 90+ days past due and accruing, which was mainly the result of a loan moving into that classification.  The decrease in total nonperforming assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the charge-off of one commercial and industrial relationship.  
  The decrease in OREO during the first quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015 was due to net sales outpacing new OREO properties being recorded.

Deposits 
  The following table details Peoples  deposit balances: 

Total deposits increased $42.5 million during the third quarter of 2016, attributable to an increase of $45.8 million in non-interest-bearing deposits.  The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to commercial non-interest-bearing deposit balances, which increased $36.0 million, with individual non-interest-bearing deposit balances increasing $12.0 million during the quarter.  Commercial non-interest-bearing deposit balances were impacted by one large customer maintaining a higher balance than normal at September 30, 2016.   
  Compared to December 31, 2015, period-end deposit balances increased $39.5 million, with $27.5 million of the growth in non-interest-bearing deposits and $12.0 million of the growth in interest-bearing deposits.  The growth in non-interest-bearing deposits was attributable to growth of $38.7 million in commercial non-interest-bearing deposit balances.  Interest-bearing deposits grew as a result of all categories increasing except for certificates of deposits, which declined $59.3 million. 
  Period-end deposits increased $44.6 million compared to September 30, 2015, with $34.2 million of the growth in non-interest-bearing deposits and $10.4 million of the growth in interest-bearing deposits.  Individual and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits each grew $17.4 million.  The growth in interest-bearing deposits was the result of growth in all categories except for certificates of deposit, which decreased $71.7 million, and governmental deposits, which declined $7.2 million. 
  Non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 29% of total deposits at September 30, 2016, compared to 28% at June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.  
  Peoples continues its deposit strategy of growing low-cost core deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, and reducing its reliance on higher-cost, non-core deposits, such as retail certificates of deposit ("CDs") and brokered deposits. These actions accounted for much of the changes in deposit balances over the last several quarters.  The decreases in governmental deposit accounts during the third and second quarter of 2016 and previous quarters in 2015 were due to normal seasonal declines, as the balances typically increase annually during the first quarter. 
  Borrowed Funds 
  The following table details Peoples  short-term and long-term borrowings: 

59 

     Table of Contents  

Peoples' short-term FHLB advances generally consist of overnight borrowings being maintained in connection with the management of Peoples' daily liquidity position.  Peoples continually evaluates the overall balance sheet position given the interest rate environment.   
  During the second quarter of 2016, Peoples executed transactions to take advantage of the low interest rates, which included:  
             
    Peoples restructured $20.0 million of borrowings that had a weighted-average rate of 2.97%, resulting in a $700,000 loss.  Peoples replaced these borrowings with a long-term FHLB advance, which has an interest rate of 2.17% and matures in 2026.  
       Additional information regarding Peoples' interest rate swaps can be found in Note 10 of the Notes to the Unconsolidated Financial Statements. 

Capital/Stockholders  Equity 
  At   September 30, 2016  , capital levels for both Peoples and Peoples Bank remained substantially higher than the minimum amounts needed to be considered "well capitalized" institutions under applicable banking regulations.  These higher capital levels reflect Peoples' desire to maintain a strong capital position.  During the first quarter of 2015, Peoples adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital framework, as approved by the federal banking agencies.  The adoption of this new framework modified the calculations and well capitalized thresholds of the current risk-based capital ratios and added the new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio.  Additionally, under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation, Peoples must exceed the three minimum required ratios by at least the capital conservation buffer.  The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.625% beginning January 1, 2016 to 2.50% by January 1, 2019, and applies to the Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") ratio, tier 1 capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio.  At September 30 2016, Peoples' had a capital buffer of   6.24%  , compared to 2.50% for the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer required by January 1, 2019.  As such, Peoples exceeded the minimum ratios including the capital conservation buffer at September 30, 2016. 
  The following table details Peoples' actual risk-based capital levels and corresponding ratios: 

Peoples' capital ratios were relatively flat compared to June 30, 2016, although the leverage ratio increased 15 basis points largely due to an increase in assets late in the third quarter of 2016, which had a small impact on average assets.  Compared to September 30, 2015, the decline in capital ratios was mostly attributable to stock repurchases completed in the first quarter of 2016.  Peoples continues to be well above the amounts required to be considered "well capitalized" under applicable banking regulations.  
  In addition to traditional capital measurements, management uses tangible capital measures to evaluate the adequacy of Peoples' stockholders' equity.  Such ratios represent non-GAAP financial measures since their calculation removes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired through acquisitions on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Management believes this information is useful to investors since it facilitates the comparison of Peoples' operating

     Table of Contents  

performance, financial condition and trends to peers, especially those without a similar level of intangible assets to that of Peoples.  Further, intangible assets generally are difficult to convert into cash, especially during a financial crisis, and could decrease substantially in value should there be deterioration in the overall franchise value.  As a result, tangible equity represents a conservative measure of the capacity for a company to incur losses but remain solvent.   
  The following table reconciles the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures to amounts reported in Peoples' Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements: 

The increase in the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio at September 30, 2016 compared to the ratio at June 30, 2016 was due mainly to the quarterly earnings.  Tangible equity increased during 2016, largely as a result of the increase in the market value of Peoples' available-for-sale investment portfolio coupled with the current year-to-date earnings. 
  Tangible book value per common share was $16.14 at September 30, 2016, compared to $14.86 at the end of the prior year third quarter and $15.93 at the end of the linked quarter.  The increase from the previous year was primarily attributed to a decrease in the number of common shares outstanding coupled with an increase in the market value of Peoples' available for sale investment portfolio.  The increase from the linked quarter was due to current year-to-date earnings.  
   
  Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity 
  While Peoples is exposed to various business risks, the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are major risks that can materially impact future results of operations and financial condition due to their complexity and dynamic nature.  The objective of Peoples' asset/liability management ( ALM ) function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity and safety.  This objective requires Peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through its management of the mix of assets and liabilities, their related cash flows, and the rates earned and paid on those assets and liabilities.  Ultimately, the ALM function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets, and selection of appropriate funding sources. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk ( IRR ) is one of the most significant risks arising in the normal course of business of financial services companies like Peoples.  IRR is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities.  Peoples' exposure to IRR is due primarily to differences in the maturity or repricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  In addition, other  

61 

     Table of Contents  

factors, such as prepayments of loans and investment securities, or early withdrawal of deposits, can expose Peoples to IRR and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams. 
  Peoples has assigned overall management of IRR to its Asset-Liability Committee (the  ALCO ), which has established an IRR management policy that sets minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of IRR.  The methods used by the ALCO to assess IRR remain unchanged from those disclosed in Peoples'   2015   Form 10-K. 
  The following table shows the estimated changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity based upon a standard, parallel shock analysis (dollars in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , Peoples' Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet remained positioned for a rising interest rate environment, as illustrated by the potential increase in net interest income shown in the above table.  While parallel interest rate shock scenarios are useful in assessing the level of IRR inherent in Peoples' Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet, interest rates typically move in a non-parallel manner, with differences in the timing, direction and magnitude of changes in short-term and long-term interest rates.  Thus, any benefit that could occur as a result of the Federal Reserve Board increasing short-term interest rates in future quarters could be offset by an inverse movement in long-term interest rates. 
   Peoples entered into interest rate swaps in the second quarter of 2016 as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Peoples making fixed payments.  As of September 30, 2016, Peoples had three interest rate swaps with a notional value of $30 million.  
  Liquidity 
  In addition to IRR management, another major objective of the ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity.  The methods used by the ALCO to monitor and evaluate the adequacy of Peoples' liquidity position remain unchanged from those disclosed in Peoples'   2015   Form 10-K. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Peoples had liquid assets of $145.0 million, which represented 3.9% of total assets and unfunded commitments.  This amount exceeded the minimal level of $74.2 million, or 2% of total loans and unfunded commitments, currently required under Peoples' liquidity policy.  Peoples also had an additional $73.4 million of unpledged investment securities not included in the measurement of liquid assets. 
  Management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, and anticipated cash flows from the investment portfolio, along with the availability of other funding sources, will allow Peoples to meet anticipated cash obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments. 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Activities and Contractual Obligations 
  In the normal course of business, Peoples is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk necessary to meet the financing needs of Peoples' customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The contract amounts of these instruments express the extent of involvement Peoples has in these financial instruments. 
  Loan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit 
  Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of Peoples' customers.  Standby letters of credit are instruments issued by Peoples Bank guaranteeing the beneficiary payment by Peoples Bank in the event of default by Peoples Bank's customer in the nonperformance of an obligation or service.  Historically, most loan commitments and standby letters of credit expire unused.  Peoples' exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter-party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  Peoples uses the same underwriting standards in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance  

62 

     Table of Contents  

sheet instruments.  The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer.  Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.   
  Peoples routinely engages in activities that involve, to varying degrees, elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements.  These activities are part of Peoples' normal course of business and include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, interest rate contracts and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low-income housing tax credit investments.  Traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments continue to represent the most significant off-balance sheet exposure.  
  The following table details the total contractual amount of loan commitments and standby letters of credit: 

Management does not anticipate that Peoples  current off-balance sheet activities will have a material impact on its future results of operations and financial condition based on historical experience and recent trends. 
   
  ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The information called for by this Item 3 is provided under the caption  Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity  under  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  in this Form 10-Q, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
   
  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Peoples' management, with the participation of Peoples' President and Chief Executive Officer and Peoples  Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Peoples  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based upon that evaluation, Peoples  President and Chief Executive Officer and Peoples  Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer have concluded that: 
           (a) 
    information required to be disclosed by Peoples in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports Peoples files or submits under the Exchange Act would be accumulated and communicated to Peoples  management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; 
              (b) 
    information required to be disclosed by Peoples in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports Peoples files or submits under the Exchange Act would be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and 
              (c) 
    Peoples  disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in Peoples' internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during Peoples' fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Peoples  internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
  ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  In the ordinary course of their respective businesses or operations, Peoples or one of its subsidiaries may be named as a plaintiff, a defendant, or a party to a legal proceeding or any of their respective properties may be subject to various pending and threatened legal proceedings and various actual and potential claims.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, Peoples cannot state what the eventual outcome of any such matters will be; however, based on management's current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of Peoples. 
   
  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
  The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business. 
  The referendum held in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") on June 23, 2016 resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the European Union ("EU").  Such an exit from the European Union is unprecedented and it is unclear how the U.K.'s access to the EU single market, and the wider trading, legal and regulatory environment in which Peoples, its customers and its counterparties operate, will be impacted and how this will affect Peoples' and its business and the global macroeconomic environment.  The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.'s exit and its consequences could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility and adversely affect Peoples' business, including revenues from trading and investment banking activities and results of operations and financial condition.  
  The accounting treatment of the interest rate swaps entered into by Peoples in the second quarter of 2016 as part of its interest rate management strategy may change if the hedging relationship is not as effective as currently anticipated.  These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Peoples making fixed payments.  As of September 30, 2016, Peoples had three interest rate swaps with a notional value of $30.0 million.  The swaps become effective in 2018, roughly to coincide with the maturity of existing FHLB advances and their expected replacement dates.  
  Although Peoples expects that the hedging relationship will be highly effective as described above, it has not assumed that there will be no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship.  As of September 30, 2016, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $7.1 million.  As of September 30, 2016, Peoples has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted collateral of $8.7 million against its obligations under these agreements.  If Peoples had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.  
  There have been no other material changes from those risk factors previously disclosed in  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  of Part I of Peoples  2015 Form 10-K.  Those risk factors are not the only risks Peoples faces.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect Peoples  business, financial condition and/or operating results.
