  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016 
    
  (unaudited) 

(1)  Formation of the Partnership, Organization and Nature of Business    
    
  Organization 
    
  CVR Partners, LP (referred to as "CVR Partners" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed by CVR Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, but excluding the Partnership and its subsidiaries, "CVR Energy") to own, operate and grow its nitrogen fertilizer business. Nitrogen fertilizer is used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops, primarily corn and wheat. The Partnership principally produces ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN"), an aqueous solution of urea and ammonium nitrate. The Partnership's product sales are sold on a wholesale basis in North America.  
    
  The Partnership produces nitrogen fertilizer products at   two   manufacturing facilities, which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas (the "Coffeyville Facility") and East Dubuque, Illinois (the "East Dubuque Facility"). On April 1, 2016, the Partnership completed the merger (the "East Dubuque Merger") with CVR Nitrogen, LP (formerly known as East Dubuque Nitrogen Partners, L.P. and also formerly known as Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P.) ("CVR Nitrogen") and with CVR Nitrogen GP, LLC (formerly known as East Dubuque Nitrogen GP, LLC and also formerly known as Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC) ("CVR Nitrogen GP"), whereby the Partnership acquired the East Dubuque Facility. See   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   for further discussion. 
    
  The Partnership's subsidiaries include Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC ("CRNF"), which owns and operates the Coffeyville Facility, and East Dubuque Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC ("EDNF"), which owns and operates the East Dubuque Facility. Both facilities manufacture ammonia and are able to further upgrade to other nitrogen fertilizer products, principally UAN. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , public security holders held approximately   66%   of the Partnership's outstanding limited partner interests and Coffeyville Resources, LLC ("CRLLC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy, held approximately   34%   of the Partnership's outstanding limited partner interests and   100%   of the noneconomic general partner interest. As of   September 30, 2016  , Icahn Enterprises L.P. ("IEP") and its affiliates owned approximately   82%   of the shares of CVR Energy. 
    
  Management and Operations 
    
  CVR GP, LLC ("CVR GP" or the "general partner") manages and operates the Partnership. Common unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting the Partnership. In addition, common unitholders have no right to elect the general partner's directors on an annual or continuing basis.  
    
  The Partnership is operated by a combination of the general partner's senior management team and CVR Energy's senior management team pursuant to a services agreement among CVR Energy, CVR GP and the Partnership. The various rights and responsibilities of the Partnership's partners are set forth in the limited partnership agreement. The Partnership also is party to a number of agreements with CVR Energy and CVR GP to regulate certain business relations between the Partnership and the other parties thereto. See   Note 15 ("Related Party Transactions")   for further discussion. 

(2)  Basis of Presentation    
    
  The accompanying Partnership condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CVR Partners and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   December 31, 2015   audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in CVR Partners  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on February 18, 2016 (the "2015 Form 10-K"). 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include certain selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses that CVR Energy and its subsidiaries incurred on behalf of the Partnership. These related party transactions are governed by

the services agreement. See   Note 15 ("Related Party Transactions")   for additional discussion of the services agreement and billing and allocation of certain costs.  
    
  In the opinion of the Partnership s management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary to fairly present the financial position of the Partnership as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) of the Partnership for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the cash flows of the Partnership for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the changes in partners  capital for the Partnership for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be realized for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other interim or annual period. 
    
  Planned Major Maintenance Costs 
    
  The direct-expense method of accounting is used for maintenance activities, including planned major maintenance activities and other less extensive shutdowns. Maintenance costs are recognized as expense when maintenance services are performed. Planned major maintenance activities generally occur every   two   to   three years  .  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the East Dubuque Facility completed a major scheduled turnaround. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately   $6.6 million   associated with the 2016 East Dubuque Facility turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Coffeyville Facility completed a major scheduled turnaround. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately   $6.6 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, associated with the 2015 Coffeyville Facility turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Cost Classifications 
    
  Cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of freight and distribution expenses, feedstock expenses, purchased ammonia and purchased hydrogen. 
    
  Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of energy and other utility costs, direct costs of labor, property taxes, plant-related maintenance services and environmental and safety compliance costs as well as catalyst and chemical costs. Direct operating expenses also include allocated share-based compensation from CVR Energy and its subsidiaries, as discussed in   Note 5 ("Share Based Compensation")  .  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of direct and allocated legal expenses, treasury, accounting, marketing, human resources, information technology and maintaining the corporate offices. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include allocated share-based compensation from CVR Energy and its subsidiaries, as discussed in   Note 5 ("Share Based Compensation")  .

Cost of product sold, direct operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses are presented exclusive of depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation and amortization consisted of the following: 

Income Taxes 
  CVR Partners is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The income tax liability of the common unitholders is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. Generally, each common unitholder is required to take into account its respective share of CVR Partners' income, gains, loss and deductions. The Partnership is not subject to income taxes, except for a franchise tax in the State of Texas and a replacement tax in the State of Illinois.  
  CVR Nitrogen Holdings, LLC, a corporate entity wholly owned by CVR Partners, generates income or loss based on its own activities. As a limited liability company electing tax treatment as a corporation, the entity is subject to federal and state income taxes. 
  Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 740,   Income Taxes  , both the Partnership (for taxes based on income such as the Texas franchise tax and the Illinois replacement tax) and the corporate entity account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at the end of the period. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. When applicable, penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as income tax expense.  

(3)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard was originally effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date making the standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB will continue to permit entities to adopt the standard on the original effective date if they choose. The Partnership will adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective application method. Given the complexity of this new guidance, the Partnership is continuing to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs"   ("ASU 2015-03")  .   The new standard required that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and was required to be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption was permitted. The Partnership adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016 and applied the standard retrospectively to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to   Note 12 ("Debt")   for further details. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "  Leases"   ("ASU 2016-02")  .   The new standard revises accounting for operating leases by a lessee, among other changes, and requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the balance sheet. The standard is effective for the first interim and annual

The Partnership is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 

(4)  East Dubuque Merger    
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Partnership completed the East Dubuque Merger as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 9, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby the Partnership acquired CVR Nitrogen and CVR Nitrogen GP. Pursuant to the East Dubuque Merger, the Partnership acquired the East Dubuque Facility. 
    
  CVR Nitrogen was required to sell or spin off its facility located in Pasadena, Texas (the "Pasadena Facility") as a condition to closing of the East Dubuque Merger. On March 14, 2016, CVR Nitrogen completed the sale to a third party of   100%   of the issued and outstanding membership interests of its subsidiary that owned the Pasadena Facility. Holders of common units representing limited partner interests in CVR Nitrogen ("CVR Nitrogen common units") of record as of March 28, 2016 received consideration for the Pasadena Facility and may receive additional consideration in the future according to the terms of the purchase agreement. The Partnership did not receive and will not receive any consideration relating to the sale of the Pasadena Facility. 
    
  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, holders of CVR Nitrogen common units eligible to receive consideration received   1.04   common units (the "unit consideration") representing limited partner interests in CVR Partners ("CVR Partners common units") and   $2.57   in cash, without interest, (the "cash consideration" and together with the unit consideration, the "merger consideration") for each CVR Nitrogen common unit. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CVR Partners issued approximately   40.2 million   CVR Partners common units and paid approximately   $99.2 million   in cash consideration to CVR Nitrogen common unitholders and certain holders of CVR Nitrogen phantom units discussed below.  
    
  Phantom units granted and outstanding under CVR Nitrogen s equity plans and held by an employee who continued in the employment of a CVR Partners-affiliated entity upon closing of the East Dubuque Merger were canceled and replaced with new incentive awards of substantially equivalent value and on similar terms. See   Note 5 ("Share Based Compensation")   for further discussion. Each phantom unit granted and outstanding and held by (i) an employee who did not continue in employment of a CVR Partners-affiliated entity, or (ii) a director of CVR Nitrogen GP, upon closing of the East Dubuque Merger, vested in full and the holders thereof received the merger consideration. 
    
  In accordance with the FASB s ASC Topic 805     Business Combinations   ("ASC 805"), the Partnership accounted for the East Dubuque Merger as an acquisition of a business with CVR Partners as the acquirer. ASC 805 requires that the consideration transferred be measured at the current market price at the date of the closing of the East Dubuque Merger. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately   $802.4 million  , including the fair value of CVR Partners common units issued of   $335.7 million  , a cash contribution of   $99.2 million   and   $367.5 million   fair value of assumed debt. The East Dubuque Facility contributed net sales of   $32.3 million   and   $92.0 million  , respectively, and operating income of   $3.9 million   and operating loss of   $4.3 million  , respectively, to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In March 2016, CVR Energy purchased   400,000   CVR Nitrogen common units, representing approximately   1%   of the outstanding CVR Nitrogen limited partner interests. CVR Energy did not receive merger consideration for these designated CVR Nitrogen common units. The Partnership recorded the noncontrolling interest fair value of   $4.6 million   in the purchase price consideration on April 1, 2016. Subsequent to the East Dubuque Merger, CVR Energy contributed   $0.5 million   to CVR Nitrogen, and the Partnership purchased the   400,000   CVR Nitrogen common units from CVR Energy during the second quarter of 2016 for   $5.0 million  . The transaction eliminated the noncontrolling interest, and the net impact of   $0.1 million   was recorded as an increase to partners' capital on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Partners' Capital for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Partnership owns   100%   of the outstanding limited partners interests of CVR Nitrogen as of   September 30, 2016  .

    As discussed above, each phantom unit granted and outstanding and held by (i) an employee who did not continue in the employment of a CVR Partners-affiliated entity, or (ii) a director of CVR Nitrogen GP, upon closing of the East Dubuque Merger, vested in full and the holders thereof received the merger consideration.  
       
  Merger-Related Indebtedness 
    
  CVR Nitrogen s debt arrangements that remained in place after the closing date of the East Dubuque Merger included   $320.0 million   of its   6.5%   notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes"). The majority of the 2021 Notes were repurchased in June 2016, as discussed further in   Note 12 ("Debt")  . 
    
  Immediately prior to the East Dubuque Merger, CVR Nitrogen also had outstanding balances under a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as successor-in-interest by assignment from General Electric Company, as administrative agent (the "Wells Fargo Credit Agreement"). The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement consisted of a   $50.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility with a   $10.0 million   letter of credit sublimit. In connection with the closing of the East Dubuque Merger, the Partnership paid   $49.4 million   for the outstanding balance, accrued interest and fees under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, and the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement was canceled.

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation 
    
  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to CVR Nitrogen's net tangible assets based on their fair values as of April 1, 2016. The Partnership obtained a preliminary independent appraisal of the net assets acquired. Determining the fair value of net tangible assets requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Partnership based its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain. Although the Partnership believes the estimates of fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are accurate, these estimates are preliminary and are subject to change during the measurement period. This measurement period may extend up to one year from the acquisition date. 
    
  The following table, set forth below, displays the estimated purchase price allocated to CVR Nitrogen's net tangible assets based on their fair values as of April 1, 2016. There were   no   identifiable intangible assets. 

_____________ 
           (1) 
    Includes   $4.0 million   for the estimated fair value of insurance proceeds related to an event that occurred prior to the East Dubuque Merger. The Partnership received   $4.0 million   during the second quarter of 2016, which was included in operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    Includes an assumed liability of   $11.8 million   for third-party financial advisory services provided to CVR Nitrogen that became payable upon the closing of the East Dubuque Merger, and was subsequently paid by CVR Partners on April 1, 2016, which was included in operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  Pro Forma Financial Information 
    
  The summary pro forma financial information for the periods presented below gives effect to the East Dubuque Merger as if it had occurred at January 1, 2015. The pro forma financial information for all periods presented were adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are i) directly attributable to the East Dubuque Merger, ii) factually supportable and iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Pro forma net income (loss) has been adjusted to exclude   $0.7 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively, of merger-related costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and to exclude   $3.9 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, of merger-related costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Pro forma net income (loss) has also been

  CVR PARTNERS, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

adjusted to exclude   $13.0 million   of nonrecurring expenses related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory and deferred revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Incremental interest expense for financing the cash merger consideration and financing the payoff of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement has also been adjusted for in the pro forma financial information, as well as incremental depreciation resulting from increased fair value of the property, plant and equipment as noted in the preliminary purchase price allocation. 
    
  The summary pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Partnership's consolidated results of operations actually would have been if the East Dubuque Merger had occurred at any date, and such data does not purport to project the Partnership's results of operations for any future period. The basic and diluted units outstanding used to calculate the pro forma net income (loss) per unit amounts presented below have been adjusted to assume units issued at the closing of the East Dubuque Merger were outstanding since January 1, 2015.  

Expenses Associated with the East Dubuque Merger 
    
  During the three months ended    September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership incurred approximately   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership incurred approximately   $3.1 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).  

(5)  Share Based Compensation    
    
  Certain employees of CVR Partners and employees of CVR Energy who perform services for the Partnership under the services agreement with CVR Energy participate in equity-based compensation plans of CVR Partners' affiliates. Accordingly, CVR Partners has recorded compensation expense for these plans. All compensation expense related to these plans for full-time employees of CVR Partners has been allocated   100%   to the Partnership. For employees of CVR Energy, the Partnership records share-based compensation relative to the percentage of time spent by each employee providing services to the Partnership as compared to the total calculated share-based compensation by CVR Energy. The Partnership is not responsible for payment of the allocated share-based compensation for certain plans. Allocated expense amounts related to plans for which the Partnership is not responsible for payment are immaterial and are reflected as an increase or decrease to partners' capital. 
    
  Long-Term Incentive Plan   CVR Energy 
    
  CVR Energy has a Long-Term Incentive Plan ("CVR Energy LTIP") that permits the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights, share awards and performance awards (including performance share units, performance units and performance based restricted stock). As of   September 30, 2016  , only performance units remain outstanding under the CVR Energy LTIP. Individuals who are eligible to receive awards and grants under the CVR Energy LTIP include CVR Energy s or its subsidiaries  (including the Partnership) employees, officers, consultants and directors.

Performance Unit Awards 
    
  In December 2015, CVR Energy entered into a performance unit award agreement (the "2015 Performance Unit Award Agreement") with its Chief Executive Officer. Compensation cost for the 2015 Performance Unit Award Agreement will be recognized over the performance cycle from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The performance unit award represents the right to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to a defined threshold in accordance with the award agreement, multiplied by a performance factor that is based upon the achievement of certain operating objectives. The Partnership will be responsible for reimbursing CVR Energy for its allocated portion of the performance unit award. Assuming a target performance threshold and that the allocation of costs from CVR Energy remains consistent with the allocation percentages in place at   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $0.1 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2015 Performance Unit Award Agreement to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   0.3 years  . Compensation expense recorded for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the awards was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. The Partnership will be responsible for reimbursing CVR Energy for its allocated portion of the awards. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had a liability of   $0.4 million  , for its allocated portion of the 2015 Performance Unit Award Agreement, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Incentive Unit Awards   CVR Energy 
    
  CVR Energy has granted awards of incentive units and distribution equivalent rights to certain employees of CRLLC, CVR Energy and the Partnership's general partner who provide shared services to CVR Energy and its subsidiaries (including the Partnership). The awards are generally graded-vesting awards, which are expected to vest over   three   years, with one-third of the award vesting each year. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective tranche of the award. Each incentive unit and distribution equivalent right represents the right to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to (i) the average fair market value of   one   common unit of CVR Refining, LP ("CVR Refining") in accordance with the award agreement, plus (ii) the per unit cash value of all distributions declared and paid by CVR Refining from the grant date to and including the vesting date. The awards, which are liability-classified, are remeasured at each subsequent reporting date until they vest. 
    
  Assuming the allocation of costs from CVR Energy remains consistent with the allocation percentages in place at   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $0.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the incentive units and associated distribution equivalent rights to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   1.0 year  . Inclusion of a vesting table would not be meaningful due to changes in allocation percentages that may occur from time to time. The unrecognized compensation expense has been determined by the number of incentive units and respective allocation percentage for individuals for whom, as of   September 30, 2016  , compensation expense has been allocated to the Partnership. Compensation expense recorded for both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the awards was approximately   $0.2 million  . Compensation expense recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the awards was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. The Partnership will be responsible for reimbursing CVR Energy for its allocated portion of the awards.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Partnership had a liability of   $0.7 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, for its allocated portion of non-vested incentive units and associated distribution equivalent rights, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Long-Term Incentive Plan   CVR Partners 
    
  The Partnership has a long-term incentive plan ("CVR Partners LTIP") that provides for the grant of options, unit appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights, restricted units, phantom units and other unit-based awards, each in respect of common units. Individuals eligible to receive awards pursuant to the CVR Partners LTIP include (i) employees of the Partnership and its subsidiaries, (ii) employees of the general partner, (iii) members of the board of directors of the general partner, and (iv) certain CVR Partners' parent's employees, consultants and directors who perform services for the benefit of the Partnership.  
    
  Through the CVR Partners LTIP, phantom unit awards outstanding include awards granted to employees of both the Partnership and the general partner. Phantom unit awards made to employees of the general partner are considered non-employee equity based-awards. The phantom unit awards outstanding vest over a   three  -year period and are required to be remeasured each reporting period until they vest. The maximum number of common units issuable under the CVR Partners LTIP is   5,000,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there

were   4,820,215   common units available for issuance under the CVR Partners LTIP. As all phantom unit awards discussed below are cash settled awards, they do not reduce the number of common units available for issuance. 
    
  Certain Units and Phantom Units Awards 
    
  Awards of phantom units and distribution equivalent rights have been granted to certain employees of the Partnership and its subsidiaries' employees and the employees of the general partner. The awards are generally graded-vesting awards, which are expected to vest over   three   years with one-third of the award vesting each year. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective tranche of the award. Each phantom unit and distribution equivalent right represents the right to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to (i) the average fair market value of   one   unit of the Partnership's common units in accordance with the award agreement, plus (ii) the per unit cash value of all distributions declared and paid by the Partnership from the grant date to and including the vesting date. The awards, which are liability-classified, are remeasured at each subsequent reporting date until they vest. 
    
  In connection with the East Dubuque Merger as described in   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")  ,   195,980   phantom units were granted to certain CVR Nitrogen employees.  A related liability of   $0.6 million   was recorded as part of the opening balance sheet and included in personnel accruals in the purchase price allocation in   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")  .  Subsequent to the East Dubuque Merger,   79,654   awards were subject to an accelerated vesting date and were paid in full resulting in the early recognition of   $0.4 million   as compensation expense in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the nine months ending   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  A summary of the phantom unit activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is presented below:  

Unrecognized compensation expense associated with the unvested phantom units at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $1.4 million   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.0 year  . Compensation benefit recorded for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the awards under the CVR Partners LTIP was approximately   $0.2 million  . Compensation expense recorded for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the awards under the CVR Partners LTIP was approximately   $0.1 million  . Compensation expense recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the awards under the CVR Partners LTIP was approximately   $1.2 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. Compensation expense related to the awards to employees of the Partnership and its subsidiaries under the CVR Partners LTIP has been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - third parties and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - third parties. Compensation expense related to the awards issued to employees of the general partner under the CVR Partners LTIP has been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - affiliates and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - affiliates. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the Partnership had a liability of   $1.8 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, for cash settled non-vested phantom unit awards and associated distribution equivalent rights, which is recorded in personnel accruals on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Performance-Based Phantom Unit Award 
    
  In May 2014, the Partnership entered into a Phantom Unit Agreement with Mark A. Pytosh, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the general partner, that included performance-based phantom units and distribution equivalent rights. Compensation cost for these awards is being recognized over the performance cycles of May 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, as the services are provided. Each phantom unit and distribution equivalent right

represents the right to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to (i) the average closing price of the Partnership's common units in accordance with the agreement, multiplied by a performance factor that is based upon the level of the Partnership s production of UAN, and (ii) the per unit cash value of all distributions declared and paid by the Partnership from the grant date to and including the vesting date. Compensation expense for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the awards was nominal. Based on current estimates of performance thresholds for the remaining performance cycles, unrecognized compensation expense and the liability associated with the unvested phantom units as of   September 30, 2016   was nominal. The unrecognized compensation expense and the liability associated with the unvested phantom units as of   December 31, 2015   were nominal. 

(6)  Inventories    
    
  Inventories consisted of the following:  

(7)  Property, Plant and Equipment    
    
  A summary of costs and accumulated depreciation for property, plant and equipment is as follows: 

Capitalized interest recognized as a reduction of interest expense was approximately   $21,000   and   $9,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , capitalized interest recognized as a reduction of interest expense was   $0.4 million   and   $9,000  , respectively. 

(8)  Partners  Capital and Partnership Distributions    
    
  The Partnership has   two   types of partnership interests outstanding: 

common units; and 

a general partner interest, which is not entitled to any distributions, and which is held by the general partner.

  (unaudited) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had a total of   113,282,973   common units issued and outstanding, of which   38,920,000   common units were owned by CRLLC, representing approximately   34%   of the total Partnership common units outstanding. 
    
  The board of directors of the Partnership's general partner has a policy for the Partnership to distribute all available cash generated on a quarterly basis. Cash distributions will be made to the common unitholders of record on the applicable record date, generally within   60 days   after the end of each quarter. Available cash for each quarter will be determined by the board of directors of the general partner following the end of such quarter.  
    
  Available cash begins with Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate, and expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income before interest expense, net, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization) further adjusted for the impact of non-cash share-based compensation, and, when applicable, major scheduled turnaround expense, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger and business interruption insurance recovery. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner, and available cash is increased by the business interruption insurance proceeds and the impact of purchase accounting. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of the general partner. The board of directors of the general partner may modify the cash distribution policy at any time, and the partnership agreement does not require the board of directors of the general partner to make distributions at all. 
    
  The following is a summary of cash distributions paid to the Partnership's unitholders during 2016 for the respective quarters to which the distributions relate: 

_____________________________ 
    
  (1) The distribution per common unit for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is calculated based on the post-merger common units outstanding. 

(9)  Net Income (Loss) per Common Unit    
    
  The Partnership's net income (loss) is allocated wholly to the common units, as the general partner does not have an economic interest. Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period and, when applicable, gives effect to certain units granted under the CVR Partners LTIP. The common units issued during the period are included on a weighted-average basis for the days in which they were outstanding.

(10)  Goodwill    
    
  The Partnership evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually as of November 1 and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Partnership's goodwill reporting unit is the Coffeyville Facility.   
    
  Based on a significant decline in market capitalization and lower cash flow forecasts resulting from weakened fertilizer pricing trends during the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership identified a triggering event and therefore performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016. The goodwill impairment quantitative testing involves a two-step process. Step 1 compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The Coffeyville Facility reporting unit fair value is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including guideline public company multiples and projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved. The carrying amount of the reporting unit was less than its fair value; therefore, a Step 2 was not required to be completed and no impairment was recorded. 
    
  The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately   17   percent based upon the results of the Step 1 test as of September 30, 2016. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in management s estimates used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.  Assumptions used in the discounted cash flows ("DCF") require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective. The most significant assumption to determining the fair value of the reporting unit was forecasted fertilizer pricing. Changes in assumptions may result in a change in management's estimates and may result in an impairment in future periods, including, but not limited to, further declines in the forecasted fertilizer pricing.

(12)  Debt    
    
  Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

As discussed in Note 3 ("Recent Accounting Pronouncements"), the Partnership adopted ASU 2015-03, "  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ", which requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. As a result of adoption of the standard, debt issuance costs of   $0.2 million   were reclassified as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt balances in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. A nominal amount of debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility was presented as assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization of the discount on debt and amortization of deferred financing costs reported as interest expense and other financing costs totaled approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization of the discount on debt and amortization of deferred financing costs reported as interest expense and other financing costs totaled approximately   $1.0 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  2023 Notes 
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Partnership and CVR Nitrogen Finance Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, (together the "2023 Notes Issuers"), certain subsidiary guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and as collateral trustee, completed a private offering of   $645.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   9.250%   Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes"). The 2023 Notes mature on June 15, 2023, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the issuers. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2016. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Partnership s existing subsidiaries. 
    
  The 2023 Notes were issued at a   $16.1 million   discount, which is being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes as interest expense using the effective-interest method. The Partnership received approximately   $622.9 million   of cash proceeds, net of the original issue discount and underwriting fees, but before deducting other third-party fees and expenses associated with the offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Notes were used to: (i) repay all amounts outstanding under the CRLLC Facility (defined and discussed below); (ii) finance the 2021 Notes Tender Offer (defined and discussed below) and (iii) to pay related fees and expenses. 
    
  The debt issuance costs of the 2023 Notes totaled approximately   $9.4 million   and are being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes as interest expense using the effective-interest amortization method.  
    
  The 2023 Notes contain customary covenants for a financing of this type that, among other things, restrict the Partnership s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase the Partnership s units or

redeem or repurchase its subordinated debt; (iii) make investments; (iv) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units; (v) create or incur certain liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from the Partnership s restricted subsidiaries to the Partnership; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets; (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (ix) create unrestricted subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership was in compliance with the covenants contained in the 2023 Notes. 
    
  Included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is accrued interest payable totaling approximately   $18.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   related to the 2023 Notes. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the 2023 Notes was approximately   $624.0 million  . This estimate of fair value is Level 2 as it was determined by quotations obtained from a broker-dealer who makes a market in these and similar securities.  
    
  2021 Notes 
    
  The   $320.0 million   2021 Notes were issued by CVR Nitrogen and CVR Nitrogen Finance (the "2021 Notes Issuers") prior to the East Dubuque Merger. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of   6.5%   per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2021 Notes are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2021, unless repurchased or redeemed earlier in accordance with their terms.  
    
  On April 29, 2016, the 2021 Notes Issuers commenced a cash tender offer (the "Tender Offer") to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2021 Notes. In connection with the Tender Offer, the 2021 Notes Issuers solicited the consents of holders of the notes to certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the notes (the "Consent Solicitation"). As a result of the Tender Offer, on June 10, 2016, the 2021 Notes Issuers repurchased   $315,245,000   of 2021 Notes, representing approximately   98.5%   of the total outstanding principal amount of the notes at a purchase price of   $1,015   per   $1,000   in principal amount. The total amount paid related to the Tender Offer was approximately   $320.0 million  , including an approximate   $4.7 million   premium. Additionally, the 2021 Notes Issuers paid   $3.1 million   for accrued and unpaid interest for the tendered notes up to the settlement date. The 2021 Notes Issuers received the requisite consents in respect of the 2021 Notes in connection with the Consent Solicitation to amend the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. As a result, the 2021 Notes Issuers executed a supplemental indenture, dated as of June 10, 2016, which eliminated or modified substantially all of the restrictive covenants relating to CVR Nitrogen and its subsidiaries, eliminated all events of default other than failure to pay principal, premium or interest on the 2021 Notes, eliminated all conditions to satisfaction and discharge, and released the liens on the collateral securing the 2021 Notes. The repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   $5.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which includes the Tender Offer premium of   $4.7 million   and the write-off of the unamortized portion of the purchase accounting adjustment of   $0.4 million  . 
    
  Concurrently with, but separately from the Tender Offer, the 2021 Notes Issuers also commenced an offer to purchase all of the outstanding 2021 Notes at a price equal to   101%   of the principal amount thereof, as required as a result of the East Dubuque Merger (the "Change of Control Offer"). The offer expired on June 28, 2016. As a result of the Change of Control Offer, the 2021 Notes Issuers repurchased   $560,000   of 2021 Notes at a purchase price of   $1,010   per   $1,000   in principal amount. The total amount paid related to the Change of Control Offer was approximately   $0.6 million  , including a nominal amount of premium and accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  The   $4,195,000   of principal amount of the 2021 Notes that remained outstanding following the consummation of the Tender Offer and the Change of Control Offer will continue to be obligations of the 2021 Notes Issuers. Included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is accrued interest payable totaling approximately   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   related to the 2021 Notes. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was approximately   $4.2 million  . This estimate of fair value is Level 2 as it was determined by quotations obtained from a broker-dealer who makes a market in these and similar securities.  
    
  Asset Based (ABL) Credit Facility 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Partnership entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility") with a group of lenders and UBS AG, Stamford Branch ("UBS"), as administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Facility has an aggregate principal amount of availability of up to   $50.0 million   with an incremental facility, which permits an

increase in borrowings of up to   $25.0 million   in the aggregate subject to additional lender commitments and certain other conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used for capital expenditures and working capital and general corporate purposes of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The ABL Credit Facility provides for loans and standby letters of credit in an amount up to the aggregate availability under the facility, subject to meeting certain borrowing base conditions, with sub-limits of the lesser of   10%   of the total facility commitment and   $5.0 million   for swingline loans and   $10.0 million   for letters of credit. The ABL Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2021.  
    
  At the option of the borrowers, loans under the ABL Credit Facility initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to (i)   2.00%   plus LIBOR or (ii)   1.00%   plus a base rate, subject to a   0.50%   step-down based on the previous quarter s excess availability. The borrowers must also pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments and also pay customary letter of credit fees. 
    
  The ABL Credit Facility also contains customary covenants for a financing of this type that limit the ability of the Partnership and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur liens, engage in a consolidation, merger, purchase or sale of assets, pay dividends, incur indebtedness, make advances, investments and loans, enter into affiliate transactions, issue equity interests or create subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries. The ABL Credit Facility also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant, as defined therein. The Partnership was in compliance with the covenants of the ABL Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  In connection with the ABL Credit Facility, the Partnership incurred lender and other third-party costs of approximately   $1.1 million  , which are being deferred and amortized to interest expense and other financing costs using the straight-line method over the term of the facility. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership and its subsidiaries had availability under the ABL Credit Facility of   $48.0 million  . There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  CRLLC Facility 
    
  On April 1, 2016, in connection with the closing of the East Dubuque Merger, the Partnership entered into a   $300.0 million   senior term loan credit facility (the "CRLLC Facility") with CRLLC, as the lender, the proceeds of which were used by the Partnership (i) to fund the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement discussed in   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   (ii) to pay the cash consideration and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the East Dubuque Merger and related transactions and (iii) to repay all of the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement discussed below. The CRLLC Facility had a term of   two   years and an interest rate of   12.0%   per annum. Interest was calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a   360  -day year and payable quarterly. In April 2016, the Partnership borrowed   $300.0 million   under the CRLLC Facility. On June 10, 2016, the Partnership paid off the   $300.0 million   outstanding under the CRLLC Facility, paid   $7.0 million   in interest, and terminated the CRLLC Facility. 
    
  Credit Agreement 
    
  On April 13, 2011, CRNF, as borrower, and CVR Partners, as guarantor, entered into a credit facility with a group of lenders including Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, as administrative and collateral agent (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement included a term loan facility of   $125.0 million   and a revolving credit facility of   $25.0 million   with an uncommitted incremental facility of up to   $50.0 million  .   No   amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at   December 31, 2015  . The Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on April 13, 2016. On April 1, 2016, in connection with the completion of the East Dubuque Merger, the Partnership repaid all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and paid   $0.3 million   for accrued and unpaid interest. Effective upon such repayment, the Credit Agreement and all related loan documents and security interests were terminated and released. The repayment was funded from amounts drawn on the CRLLC Facility, as discussed above. The Partnership recognized a nominal amount of loss on debt extinguishment in connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Previous borrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest at either a Eurodollar rate or a base rate plus, in either case, a margin based on a pricing grid determined by the trailing   four   quarter leverage ratio. The margin for borrowings under the Credit Agreement ranges from   3.50%   to   4.25%   for Eurodollar loans and   2.50%   to   3.25%   for base rate loans. During the periods presented, the interest rate was either the   Eurodollar rate   plus a margin of   3.50%   or, for base rate loans, the   prime rate   plus   2.50%  . At   December 31, 2015  ,

the effective rate of the term loan was approximately   4.60%  , inclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps discussed in   Note 13 ("Interest Rate Swap Agreements")  .  
    
  The carrying value approximated fair value as of December 31, 2015.  

(13)  Interest Rate Swap Agreements    
    
  CRNF had   two   floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with a portion of its   $125.0 million   floating rate term debt, which expired on February 12, 2016. The floating rate term debt is discussed in   Note 12 ("Debt")  . The aggregate notional amount covered under these agreements, which commenced on August 12, 2011, totaled   $62.5 million   (split evenly between the   two   agreements). Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement entered into on June 30, 2011, CRNF received a floating rate based on three-month LIBOR and paid a fixed rate of   1.94%  . Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement entered into on July 1, 2011, CRNF received a floating rate based on three-month LIBOR and paid a fixed rate of   1.975%  . Both swap agreements were settled every   90 days  . The effect of these swap agreements was to lock in a fixed rate of interest of approximately   1.96%   plus the applicable margin paid to lenders over three-month LIBOR governed by the credit facility. The agreements were designated as cash flow hedges at inception, and accordingly, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the swap was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into interest expense when the interest rate swap transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss was recognized immediately in interest expense. The realized loss on the interest rate swap reclassified from AOCI into interest expense and other financing costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The realized loss on the interest rate swap reclassified from AOCI into interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  The interest rate swap agreements previously held by the Partnership also provided for the right to offset. However, as the interest rate swaps were in a liability position, there are no amounts offset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  .   See Note 16 ("Fair Value Measurements")   for discussion of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. 

(14)  Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Leases and Unconditional Purchase Obligations 
    
  The minimum required payments for the Partnership s operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations are as follows:

  Litigation 
    
  From time to time, the Partnership is involved in various lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including environmental, health and safety ("EHS") matters described below under "Environmental, Health and Safety Matters." Liabilities, if any, related to such litigation are recognized when the related costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. It is possible that management s estimates of the outcomes will change within the next year due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and settlement negotiations. Except as described below, there were no new proceedings or material developments in proceedings from those provided in the   2015   Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of any other litigation matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that management s beliefs or opinions with respect to liability for potential litigation matters are accurate.

Rentech Nitrogen Mergers Litigation 
    
  As previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K,   two   class action lawsuits were filed in connection with the East Dubuque Merger, (i) the "Mustard Lawsuit", which was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and (ii) the "Sloan Lawsuit" (together with Mustard Lawsuit, the "Merger Lawsuits"), which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Merger Lawsuits alleged (among other things) breach of fiduciary duties and inadequate disclosure, in each case, in connection with the East Dubuque Merger. In February 2016, the parties to the Merger Lawsuits entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the proposed settlement of the Merger Lawsuits. The parties subsequently entered into a stipulation of settlement, which was subject to customary conditions including court approval following notice to the CVR Nitrogen unitholders. In July 2016, the Mustard Lawsuit was dismissed, and in October 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued an order and judgment approving the settlement of the Sloan Lawsuit. The settlement resolves and releases all claims by unitholders of CVR Nitrogen challenging the East Dubuque Merger. The plaintiff s counsel in the Sloan Lawsuit has filed a petition for the award of attorneys  fees, which remains pending with the Court. The Partnership does not believe the settlement or the award of attorneys  fees will have a material adverse effect on the Partnership s business, financial condition or results of operation. 
    
  Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
    
  CRNF is subject to various stringent federal, state and local EHS rules and regulations. Liabilities related to EHS matters are recognized when the related costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site-specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting EHS liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted regularly as new facts emerge or changes in laws or technology occur. 
    
  There have been no new developments or material changes to the environmental accruals or expected capital expenditures related to compliance with the foregoing environmental matters from those provided in the   2015   Form 10-K. CRNF believes it is in substantial compliance with existing EHS rules and regulations. There can be no assurance that the EHS matters which may develop in the future will not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's business, financial condition or results of operations. 

(15)  Related Party Transactions    
    
  Related Party Agreements

The agreements are described as in effect at   September 30, 2016  . Except as otherwise described below, there have been no new developments or material changes to these agreements from those provided in the 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Amounts owed to CVR Partners and CRNF from CVR Energy and its subsidiaries with respect to these agreements are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Conversely, amounts owed to CVR Energy and its subsidiaries by CVR Partners and CRNF with respect to these agreements are included in accounts payable, personnel accruals and accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Partnership's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Feedstock and Shared Services Agreement   
    
  CRNF is party to a feedstock and shared services agreement with CRRM under which the   two   parties provide feedstock and other services to one another. These feedstocks and services are utilized in the respective production processes of CRRM's Coffeyville, Kansas refinery and CRNF's nitrogen fertilizer plant. 
    
  Pursuant to the feedstock and shared services agreement, CRNF and CRRM have agreed to transfer hydrogen to one another; provided, CRNF is not required to sell hydrogen to CRRM if such hydrogen is required for operation of CRNF's nitrogen fertilizer

plant, if such sale would adversely affect the Partnership's classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or if such sale would not be in CRNF's best interest. Net monthly sales of hydrogen to CRRM have been reflected as net sales for CVR Partners, when applicable. Net monthly receipts of hydrogen from CRRM have been reflected in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for CVR Partners, when applicable. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net sales generated from the sale of hydrogen to CRRM were approximately   $1.2 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the net sales generated from the sale of hydrogen to CRRM were approximately   $2.9 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, of receivables included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with unpaid balances related to hydrogen sales. 
    
  The agreement also provides a mechanism pursuant to which CRNF transfers a tail gas stream to CRRM. CRNF receives the benefit of eliminating a waste gas stream and recovers the fuel value of the tail gas system. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net sales generated from the sale of tail gas to CRRM were nominal. In April 2011, in connection with the tail gas stream transfers to CRRM, CRRM installed a pipe between the Coffeyville, Kansas refinery and the nitrogen fertilizer plant to transfer the tail gas. CRNF agreed to pay CRRM the cost of installing the pipe and provide an additional   15%   to cover the cost of capital, which was due from CRNF to CRRM over   four years  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were assets of approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, included in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , receivables of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for amounts yet to be received related to components of the feedstock and shared services agreement, other than amounts related to hydrogen transfers and tail gas discussed above. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , current obligations of approximately   $0.8 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, were included in accounts payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with unpaid balances related to components of the feedstock and shared services agreement.  
    
  Coke Supply Agreement  
    
  CRNF is party to a coke supply agreement with CRRM pursuant to which CRRM supplies CRNF with pet coke. This agreement provides that CRRM must deliver to CRNF during each calendar year an annual required amount of pet coke equal to the lesser of  
  (i)   100 percent   of the pet coke produced at CRRM's Coffeyville, Kansas petroleum refinery or (ii)   500,000   tons of pet coke. CRNF is also obligated to purchase this annual required amount. If during a calendar month CRRM produces more than   41,667   tons of pet coke, then CRNF will have the option to purchase the excess at the purchase price provided for in the agreement. If CRNF declines to exercise this option, CRRM may sell the excess to a third party.  
    
  CRNF obtains most (over   70%   on average during the last   five years  ) of the pet coke it needs from CRRM's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to the pet coke supply agreement, and procures the remainder through a contract with HollyFrontier Corporation and on the open market. The price CRNF pays pursuant to the pet coke supply agreement is based on the lesser of a pet coke price derived from the price received for UAN (the "UAN-based price") or a pet coke price index. The UAN-based price begins with a pet coke price of   $25   per ton based on a price per ton for UAN that excludes transportation cost ("netback price") of   $205   per ton, and adjusts up or down   $0.50   per ton for every   $1.00   change in the netback price. The UAN-based price has a ceiling of   $40   per ton and a floor of   $5   per ton. 
    
  CRNF will pay any taxes associated with the sale, purchase, transportation, delivery, storage or consumption of the pet coke. CRNF is entitled to offset any amount payable for the pet coke against any amount due from CRRM under the feedstock and shared services agreement between the parties.  
    
  The cost of pet coke associated with the transfer of pet coke from CRRM to CRNF were approximately   $0.5 million   and   $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which was recorded in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , these expenses were approximately   $1.7 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. Payables of   $0.3 million   related to the coke supply agreement were included in accounts payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   December 31, 2015   and a nominal amount was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .

(16)  Fair Value Measurements    
    
  In accordance with ASC Topic 820     Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ("ASC 820"), the Partnership utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.  
    
  ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 

Level 2   Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) 

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs (including the Partnership s own assumptions in determining the fair value). 
       
  There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  . The following table sets forth the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by input level, as of   December 31, 2015  . 

The Partnership had interest rate swaps that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs. The swaps expired in February 2016. See further discussion in   Note 13 ("Interest Rate Swap Agreements")  . The fair values of these interest rate swap instruments were based on discounted cash flow models that incorporated the cash flows of the derivatives, as well as the current LIBOR rate and a forward LIBOR curve, along with other observable market inputs. The fair value of the debt issuances is disclosed in   Note 12 ("Debt")  .

Partnership Overview 
    
  CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners," the "Partnership," "we," "us" or "our") is a Delaware limited partnership formed by CVR Energy to own, operate and grow our nitrogen fertilizer business. We produce and distribute nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. Our principal products are UAN and ammonia. Our product sales are heavily weighted toward UAN and all of our products are sold on a wholesale basis. 
    
  We produce our nitrogen fertilizer products at two manufacturing facilities, which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois. We acquired the East Dubuque, Illinois facility in April 2016 through our acquisition of CVR Nitrogen. For a discussion of the East Dubuque Merger, refer to   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   of Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The consolidated financial statements and key operating metrics include the results of the East Dubuque Facility beginning on April 1, 2016, the date of the closing of the acquisition.  
    
  Strategically located adjacent to CVR Refining s refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, our Coffeyville Facility is the only operation in North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our Coffeyville Facility includes a 1,300 ton-per-day ammonia unit, a 3,000 ton-per-day UAN unit, and a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. Our gasifier is a dual-train facility, with each gasifier able to function independently of the other, thereby providing redundancy and improving our reliability. We upgrade substantially all of the ammonia we produce at our Coffeyville Facility to higher margin UAN, which has historically commanded a premium price over ammonia. Approximately 96% of our Coffeyville Facility produced ammonia tons and the majority of the purchased ammonia tons were upgraded into UAN in 2015. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately   96%   and   93%  , respectively, of our Coffeyville Facility produced ammonia tons and the majority of purchased ammonia tons were upgraded into UAN. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately   92%   and   96%  , respectively, of our Coffeyville Facility produced ammonia tons and the majority of purchased ammonia tons were upgraded into UAN.  
    
  Our recently acquired East Dubuque Facility includes a 1,075 ton-per-day ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day UAN unit. The facility is located on a 210-acre, 140-foot bluff above the Mississippi River, with access to the river for loading certain products. The East Dubuque Facility has the flexibility to significantly vary its product mix. This enables us to upgrade our ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea each season, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. Product sales are heavily weighted toward sales of ammonia and UAN. For the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   41%   and   44%  , respectively, of our East Dubuque Facility produced ammonia tons were upgraded to other products.  
    
  CVR Energy, which indirectly owns our general partner and approximately   34%   of our outstanding common units, also indirectly owns the general partner and approximately   66%   of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining at   September 30, 2016  . CVR Refining owns and operates a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery with a rated capacity of 115,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd) in Coffeyville, Kansas, a complex crude oil refinery with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd in Wynnewood, Oklahoma and ancillary businesses. 
    
  We intend to continue to expand our existing asset base and utilize the experience of our and CVR Energy s management teams to execute our growth strategy, which includes expanded production of UAN and acquiring and building additional infrastructure and production assets.  
    
  The primary raw material feedstock utilized in our Coffeyville Facility's production process is pet coke, which is produced during the crude oil refining process. In contrast, substantially all of our nitrogen fertilizer competitors use natural gas as their primary raw material feedstock. Our Coffeyville Facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. We currently purchase most of the pet coke for our Coffeyville Facility from CVR Refining pursuant to a long-term agreement having an initial term that ends in 2027, subject to renewal. During the past five years, over 70% of the pet coke consumed by our Coffeyville Facility was produced and supplied by CVR Refining s Coffeyville, Kansas crude oil refinery.  
    
  The East Dubuque Facility uses low-cost, North American natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer, primarily ammonia and UAN, We are able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. Over the last five years, U.S. natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale gas, which have reduced and stabilized natural gas prices, significantly lowering our production costs.

Recent Developments 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Partnership completed the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen. Refer to   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   of Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion of the East Dubuque Merger. 
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Partnership completed a private offering of   $645.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   9.250%   Senior Secured Notes due 2023. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership repurchased approximately   $315.8 million   of the 2021 Notes pursuant to a Tender Offer and a Change of Control Offer. On September 30, 2016, the Partnership entered into the ABL Credit Facility in an aggregate principle amount of availability of up to $50.0 million. Refer to   Note 12 ("Debt")   of Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion of the debt transactions. 
    
  On October 17, 2016, the Partnership and the union representing approximately 60% of the employees at our East Dubuque Facility agreed to a new three-year collective bargaining agreement extending to October 2019. 

Major Influences on Results of Operations 
    
  Our earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, on-stream factors and direct operating expenses.  
    
  The price at which our products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.  
    
  Nitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors  facilities, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.  
    
  We have the capacity to store approximately 160,000 tons of UAN and 80,000 tons of ammonia. Our storage tanks are located primarily at our two production facilities. Inventories are often allowed to accumulate to allow customers to take delivery to meet the seasonal demand. 
    
  In order to assess our operating performance, we calculate the product pricing at gate as an input to determine our operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons. We believe product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because we sell products at our plant gate and terminal locations' gates ("sold gate") and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site ("sold delivered"). The relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a measure that is consistently comparable period to period.  
    
  We and other competitors in the U.S. farm belt share a significant transportation cost advantage when compared to our out-of-region competitors in serving the U.S. farm belt agricultural market; therefore we are able to cost-effectively sell substantially all of our products in the higher margin agricultural market. Further, we believe a significant portion of our competitors  revenues are derived from the lower margin industrial market.  
    
  Our products leave our Coffeyville Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. We do not currently incur significant intermediate transfer, storage, barge freight or pipeline freight charges; however, we do incur costs to maintain and repair our railcar fleet. Selling products to customers within economic rail transportation limits of the Coffeyville Facility and keeping transportation costs low are keys to maintaining profitability.  
    
  The East Dubuque Facility is located in northwest Illinois, in the Mid Corn Belt. The East Dubuque Facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the plant and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. The East Dubuque Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company.

     Table of Contents     

The high fixed cost of the Coffeyville Facility direct operating expense structure also directly affects our profitability. Our Coffeyville Facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. Major fixed operating expenses of our Coffeyville Facility include a large portion of electrical energy, employee labor, maintenance, including contract labor and outside services. We estimate these fixed costs averaged approximately 80% of direct operating expenses over the 24 months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Our largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia at our Coffeyville Facility is pet coke, which we purchase from CVR Refining and third parties. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred approximately   $1.7 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, for the cost of pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of   $13   and   $25  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred approximately   $5.4 million   and   $8.8 million  , respectively, for the cost of pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of   $14   and   $26  , respectively. 
    
  Our largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia at our East Dubuque Facility is natural gas, which we purchase from third parties. Our East Dubuque Facility's natural gas process results in a higher percentage of variable costs as compared to the Coffeyville Facility. For the three and six months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred approximately $4.9 million and $7.4 million for feedstock natural gas, which equaled an average cost per MMBtu of   $2.92   and   $2.68  , respectively. 
    
  Consistent, safe and reliable operations at our nitrogen fertilizer plants are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. Unplanned downtime may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a temporary increase in working capital investment and related inventory position. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is mitigated through a diligent planning process that takes into account margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance, feedstock logistics and other factors.  
  Historically, the Coffeyville Facility has undergone a full facility turnaround every two to three years. The Coffeyville Facility underwent a full facility turnaround in the third quarter of 2015, at a cost of approximately $7.0 million. The Partnership is planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround at the Coffeyville Facility in the second half of 2017, which is expected to last approximately 15 days. 
  Historically, the East Dubuque Facility has also undergone a full facility turnaround every two to three years. The East Dubuque Facility underwent a full facility turnaround in the second quarter of 2016, at a cost of approximately $6.6 million. The Partnership is planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility in 2018. 
   
  Agreements with CVR Energy and CVR Refining 
    
  We are party to several agreements with CVR Energy and its affiliates that govern the business relations among us, CVR Energy and its subsidiaries (including CVR Refining), and our general partner. These include the pet coke supply agreement under which we buy the pet coke we use in our Coffeyville Facility; a services agreement, under which CVR Energy and its subsidiaries provide us with management services including the services of its senior management team; a feedstock and shared services agreement, which governs the provision of feedstocks for our Coffeyville Facility, including, but not limited to, hydrogen, high-pressure steam, nitrogen, instrument air, oxygen and natural gas; a raw water and facilities sharing agreement, which allocates raw water resources between the two businesses; an easement agreement; an environmental agreement; a lease agreement pursuant to which we lease office space and laboratory space; and certain financing agreements that we entered into in connection with the East Dubuque Merger. These agreements were not the result of arm's-length negotiations and the terms of these agreements are not necessarily as favorable to the parties to these agreements as terms which could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See   Note 15 ("Related Party Transactions")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional discussion of the agreements. 

Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results 
    
  Our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reason discussed below. 
    
  East Dubuque Merger 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Partnership completed the East Dubuque Merger, whereby the Partnership acquired the East Dubuque Facility. The consolidated financial statements and key operating metrics include the results of the East Dubuque Facility beginning on April 1, 2016, the date of the closing of the acquisition.  

39 

     Table of Contents     

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership incurred   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership incurred   $3.1 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). 
    
  See   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   for further discussion. 
    
  Major Scheduled Turnaround Activities 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the East Dubuque Facility completed a major scheduled turnaround and the ammonia and UAN units were down for approximately 28 days. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in lost sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately $6.6 million associated with the 2016 turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Coffeyville Facility completed a major scheduled turnaround and the gasification, ammonia and UAN units were down for between 17 to 20 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of approximately   $6.6 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, associated with the 2015 turnaround are included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Linde Air Separation Unit Related Downtime 
    
  Linde owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Facility. During the third quarter of 2015, the Linde air separation unit experienced downtime, in excess of the downtime associated with the major scheduled turnaround discussed above, that resulted in the gasification, ammonia and UAN units being down for between 16 to 19 days each. Overall results were negatively impacted due to the lost production during the downtime that resulted in reduced sales and certain reduced variable expenses included in cost of product sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Indebtedness 
    
  On April 1, 2016, as a result of the East Dubuque Merger, the Partnership acquired CVR Nitrogen, including its debt. During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership used $300.0 million of funds from the CRLLC Facility to finance the payoff of CVR Partners' $125.0 million term loan, payoff CVR Nitrogen's credit facility outstanding balance of $49.1 million, and to fund the cash merger consideration and certain merger-related expenses. In June 2016, the Partnership issued   $645.0 million   aggregate principal of   9.250%   Senior Notes due 2023 to refinance the substantial majority of its existing debt, including the CRLLC Facility. As a result of the financing transactions, the Partnership wrote off approximately   $5.1 million  , including the write-off of the Tender Offer premium of   $4.7 million   and the unamortized portion of the purchase accounting adjustment of   $0.4 million   and is reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as loss on extinguishment of debt for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Also as a result of the financing transactions, the Partnership's interest expense increased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year. 
    
  Further discussion regarding the Partnership's indebtedness can be found in   Note 12 ("Debt")   of Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  

Results of Operations 
    
  The period to period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. In order to effectively review and assess our historical financial information below, we have also included supplemental operating measures and industry measures that we believe are material to understanding our business.

     Table of Contents     

To supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP-based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results. 
    
  The following tables summarize the financial data and key operating statistics for CVR Partners and our operating subsidiaries for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The results of operations for our East Dubuque Facility are included for the post acquisition period beginning April 1, 2016. The following data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. All information in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," except for the balance sheet data as of   December 31, 2015  , is unaudited.

(1) 
    Amounts are shown exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is primarily comprised of the following components: 

(2) 
    Our selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses include amounts for share-based compensation charges, which include amounts related to CVR Energy's share-based compensation expense allocated to us by CVR Energy for financial reporting purposes. See   Note 5 ("Share Based Compensation")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion of allocated share-based compensation. The charges for allocated share-based compensation was approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charges for allocated share-based compensation was approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amounts included in direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were nominal.

    Amounts are shown exclusive of major scheduled turnaround expenses that are separately disclosed. 
       
           (4) 
    The Partnership incurred approximately   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million   of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $3.1 million   and   $1.5 million   of legal and other professional fees and other merger-related expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as discussed in   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
       
           (5) 
    EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before (i) interest (income) expense, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of non-cash share-based compensation, and, when applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger and business interruption insurance recovery.  
    
  We present EBITDA because we believe it allows users of our financial statements, such as investors and analysts, to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes amounts, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger and business interruption insurance recovery, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these amounts is discussed herein, so that investors have complete information about these amounts. In addition, we believe that it is useful to exclude from Adjusted EBITDA non-cash share-based compensation, although it is a recurring cost incurred in the ordinary course of business. In our view, non-cash share-based compensation, which also is presented in our financial statements and discussed herein, reflects a non-cash cost which may obscure, for a given period, trends in the underlying business, due to the timing and nature of the equity awards. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution.  
    
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors and analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. 
    
  A reconciliation of our Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:  

43 

     Table of Contents     

(6) 
    The board of directors of our general partner has a policy to calculate available cash for distribution starting with Adjusted EBITDA. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , available cash for distribution equaled our Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deemed necessary or appropriate, and transaction expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner, and available cash is increased by the business interruption insurance proceeds and the impact of purchase accounting. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all. 
       
  Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
    
  A reconciliation of the available cash for distribution is as follows:

           (1)    
    Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.   
       
           (2) 
    Gross tons produced for ammonia represent total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.

    In addition to the produced ammonia, the Partnership acquired approximately   7.5 thousand   tons of ammonia during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Partnership did not acquire any ammonia during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Partnership also acquired approximately   8.0 thousand   tons and   29.3 thousand   tons of ammonia during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

(5) 
    The cost per MMBtu excludes derivative activity, when applicable. The impact of natural gas derivative activity during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was not material. 
       
           (6) 
    On-stream factor is the total number of hours operated divided by the total number of hours in the reporting period and is included as a measure of operating efficiency.  
       
  Excluding the impact of the full facility turnaround and the Linde air separation unit outages at the Coffeyville Facility, the on-stream factors at the Coffeyville Facility would have been   100.0%   for gasifier,   97.3%   for ammonia and   96.2%   for UAN for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Excluding the impact of the full facility turnaround and the Linde air separation unit outages at the Coffeyville Facility, the on-stream factors at the Coffeyville Facility would have been   99.8%   for gasifier,   97.0%   for ammonia and   96.9%   for UAN for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Excluding the impact of the full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility, the on-stream factors at the East Dubuque Facility would have been   97.2%   for ammonia and   96.2%   for UAN for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net Sales.   Net sales were   $78.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     compared to   $49.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $29.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes due to the inclusion of the full quarter of the East Dubuque Facility (  $32.3 million  ). For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , UAN and ammonia made up   $53.9 million   and   $17.1 million   of our consolidated net sales, respectively. This compared to UAN and ammonia consolidated net sales of   $44.8 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Excluding the East Dubuque acquisition, net sales would have decreased by $3.1 million. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales at the Coffeyville Facility for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  : 

The decrease in UAN and ammonia sales prices at the Coffeyville Facility for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to pricing fluctuation in the market. The increase in UAN product sales at the Coffeyville Facility for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to higher production volumes following the Coffeyville Facility major scheduled turnaround during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Cost of Product Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Cost of product sold consists primarily of freight and distribution expenses, feedstock expenses, purchased ammonia and purchased hydrogen. Cost of product sold for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $19.9 million  , compared to   $14.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $5.4 million     increase   was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full quarter of the East Dubuque Facility (  $6.9 million  ). 
  
   46 

     Table of Contents     

Excluding the East Dubuque acquisition, cost of product sold decreased $1.5 million, primarily due to lower costs from transactions with third parties of $0.9 million and affiliates of $0.6 million. The lower affiliate costs incurred were primarily the result of lower CVR Refining pet coke pricing. The decrease in third-party costs incurred was primarily the result of less purchased ammonia, partially offset by increased shipments associated with higher production and increased railcar repairs and inspections. 
    
  Direct Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Direct operating expenses consist primarily of energy and utility costs, direct costs of labor, property taxes, plant-related maintenance services, including turnaround, and environmental and safety compliance costs as well as catalyst and chemical costs. Direct operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     were   $32.5 million   as compared to   $33.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $0.7 million     decrease   is primarily attributable to lower expenses at our Coffeyville Facility ($10.8 million), which are due to the lower turnaround expenses ($6.6 million), lower repairs and maintenance ($2.2 million) and other less significant changes, partially offset by the inclusion of the full quarter of the East Dubuque Facility (  $10.1 million  ). The decrease in turnaround expenses are related to the turnaround at the Coffeyville Facility during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Selling, general and administrative expenses include the direct selling, general and administrative expenses of our business as well as certain expenses incurred by our affiliates, CVR Energy and CRLLC, on our behalf and billed or allocated to us in accordance with the applicable agreements. We also reimburse our general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement for expenses it incurs on our behalf. Reimbursed expenses to our general partner are included as selling, general and administrative expenses from affiliates. Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $7.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $6.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $1.3 million     increase   is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full quarter of the East Dubuque Facility (  $2.0 million  ), partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger (  $0.8 million  ). 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.   Depreciation expense was   $16.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $7.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $9.0 million   is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full quarter of the East Dubuque Facility. 
    
  Operating Income.   Operating income was   $2.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to operating loss of   $11.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $14.2 million   was the result of increases in net sales ($29.2 million) and decreases in direct operating expenses ($0.7 million), partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization ($9.0 million), cost of product sold ($5.4 million) and selling general and administrative expenses ($1.3 million). 
    
  Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs.   Interest expense was   $15.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $13.8 million   was primarily due to the increased borrowings and higher interest rate on the 2023 Notes. 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net Sales.   Net sales were   $271.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     compared to   $223.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $48.2 million   is primarily attributable to increased sales volume due to the inclusion of the six months of the East Dubuque Facility (  $92.4 million  ). For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , UAN and ammonia made up   $192.0 million   and   $57.6 million   of our consolidated net sales, respectively. This compared to UAN and ammonia net sales of   $198.5 million   and   $14.6 million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Excluding the East Dubuque acquisition, net sales would have decreased by $44.2 million. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales at the Coffeyville Facility for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  :

The decrease in UAN and ammonia sales prices at the Coffeyville Facility for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to pricing fluctuation in the market. The increase of UAN and ammonia sales volume at the Coffeyville Facility for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to higher production volumes in connection with the Coffeyville Facility major scheduled turnaround during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Cost of Product Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Cost of product sold consists primarily of freight and distribution expenses, feedstock expenses, purchased ammonia and purchased hydrogen. Cost of product sold for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $72.2 million  , compared to   $55.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $16.5 million     increase   was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the six months of the East Dubuque Facility (  $29.9 million  ).  
    
  Excluding the East Dubuque acquisition, cost of product sold decreased $13.4 million, due to lower costs from transactions with third parties of $10.2 million and affiliates of $3.2 million. The lower third-party costs incurred was primarily the result of less purchased ammonia ($13.2 million), partially offset by higher regulatory railcar repairs. The lower affiliate costs incurred were primarily the result of lower expense of CVR Refining pet coke due to lower affiliate pet coke prices. 
    
  Direct Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Direct operating expenses consist primarily of energy and utility costs, direct costs of labor, property taxes, plant-related maintenance services, including turnaround, and environmental and safety compliance costs as well as catalyst and chemical costs. Direct operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     were   $110.4 million   as compared to   $82.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $27.7 million     increase   is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the six months of the East Dubuque Facility (  $41.8 million  ), partially offset by lower expenses at our Coffeyville Facility ($14.1 million). The lower expenses at our Coffeyville Facility were primarily due to lower turnaround expenses ($7.0 million), lower utilities ($2.9 million), and lower repairs and maintenance ($2.2 million). The decrease in turnaround expenses were related to the turnaround during the third quarter of 2015 and the decrease in utilities is primarily the result of lower electrical rates. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization).   Selling, general and administrative expenses include the direct selling, general and administrative expenses of our business as well as certain expenses incurred by our affiliates, CVR Energy and CRLLC, on our behalf and billed or allocated to us in accordance with the applicable agreements. We also reimburse our general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement for expenses it incurs on our behalf. Reimbursed expenses to our general partner are included as selling, general and administrative expenses from affiliates. Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $22.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $15.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $6.8 million     increase   is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the six months of the East Dubuque Facility (  $4.6 million  ) and increased expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger (  $1.6 million  ). 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.   Depreciation expense was   $41.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $21.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $19.8 million   is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the East Dubuque Facility. 
    
  Operating Income.   Operating income was   $25.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to operating income of   $48.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $22.6 million   was the result of the increases in direct operating expenses ($27.7 million), depreciation and amortization ($19.8 million), cost of product sold ($16.5 million) and selling general and administrative expenses ($6.8 million), partially offset by increases in net sales ($48.2 million). 
    
  Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs.   Interest expense was   $32.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $5.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $27.6 million   was primarily due to the debt assumed in the East Dubuque Merger, the higher interest rate CRLLC Facility and the increased borrowings and higher interest rate on the 2023 Notes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations, which can include cash advances from customers resulting from forward sales. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying distributions to our unitholders, as further discussed below. 

48 

     Table of Contents     

We believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under the ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash commitments associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors outside of our control.  
    
  Cash Balance and Other Liquidity 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $65.3 million  , including   $5.3 million   of customer advances. Working capital at   September 30, 2016   was   $78.2 million  , consisting of   $139.9 million   in current assets and approximately   $61.7 million   in current liabilities. Working capital at   December 31, 2015   was   $72.7 million  , consisting of   $98.5 million   in current assets and   $25.9 million   in current liabilities. As of   October 25, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of $72.1 million.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we incurred additional indebtedness in connection with consummating the East Dubuque Merger. The additional indebtedness included the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, the 2021 Notes and amounts drawn on the CRLLC Facility. The outstanding balance under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement was repaid in full and terminated on April 1, 2016 utilizing funds from the CRLLC Facility. The CRLLC Facility is discussed further in   Note 12 ("Debt")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 
    
  Also on April 1, 2016, the Partnership repaid all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement as further discussed in   Note 12 ("Debt")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Effective upon such repayment, the Credit Agreement and all related loan documents and security interests were terminated and released. The repayment was funded from amounts drawn on the CRLLC Facility. 
    
  In June 2016, the Partnership and CVR Nitrogen Finance issued   $645.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The Partnership received approximately   $622.9 million   of cash proceeds, net of the original issue discount and underwriting fees, but before deducting other third-party fees and expenses associated with the offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Notes were used to (i) repay all amounts outstanding under the CRLLC Facility; (ii) finance the 2021 Notes Tender Offer and (iii) pay related fees and expenses.  
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Partnership paid off the   $300.0 million   outstanding under the CRLLC Facility and paid $7.0 million in interest, and the CRLLC Facility was terminated.  
    
  Also in June 2016, the Partnership repaid the substantial majority of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Notes in connection with the Tender Offer and the Change of Control Offer. The total amount paid related to the Tender Offer and Change of Control Offer was approximately $320.6 million, including an approximate   $4.7 million   premium. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $4,195,000   of aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes was outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2021 Notes contain substantially no restrictive covenants and are not secured.  
    
  2023 Notes 
    
  On June 10, 2016, the Partnership and CVR Nitrogen Finance issued   $645.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2023. The 2023 Notes were issued at a   $16.1 million   discount, which is being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes as interest expense using the effective-interest method. As a result of the issuance, approximately   $9.4 million   of debt issuance costs were incurred, which are being amortized over the term of the 2023 Notes as interest expense using the effective-interest method.  
    
  The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Partnership s existing subsidiaries. 
    
  At any time prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any of one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes issued under the indenture governing the 2023 Notes in an amount not greater than the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.250% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) the Make Whole Premium, as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes, at the redemption date, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. 

49 

     Table of Contents     

On and after June 15, 2019, we may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the 2023 Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date on such Notes, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on June 15 of the years indicated below: 

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in the indenture (including the sale of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Partnership and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), each holder of the 2023 Notes will have the right to require that the Partnership repurchase all or a portion of such holder s 2023 Notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. 
    
  The 2023 Notes contain customary covenants for a financing of this type that, among other things, restrict the Partnership s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase the Partnership s units or redeem or repurchase its subordinated debt; (iii) make investments; (iv) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units; (v) create or incur certain liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from the Partnership s restricted subsidiaries to the Partnership; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets; (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (ix) create unrestricted subsidiaries.  Most of the foregoing covenants would cease to apply at such time that the 2023 Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard   Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. However, such covenants would be reinstituted if the 2023 Notes subsequently lost their investment grade rating. In addition, the indenture contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which would result in, or permit the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the 2023 Notes to cause, the acceleration of the 2023 Notes, in addition to the pursuit of other available remedies.           
  The indenture governing the 2023 Notes prohibits us from making distributions to unitholders if any default or event of default (as defined in the indenture) exists. In addition, the indenture limits our ability to pay distributions to unitholders. The covenants will apply differently depending on our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture). If the fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.75 to 1.0, we will generally be permitted to make restricted payments, including distributions to our unitholders, without substantive restriction. If the fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.75 to 1.0, we will generally be permitted to make restricted payments, including distributions to our unitholders, up to an aggregate $75.0 million basket plus certain other amounts referred to as "incremental funds" under the indenture. We were in compliance with the covenants as of   September 30, 2016  , and the ratio was satisfied (not less than 1.75 to 1.0). 
    
  Asset Based (ABL) Credit Facility.   
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Partnership entered into the ABL Credit Facility with a group of lenders and UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Facility is a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of availability of up to $50.0 million with an incremental facility, which permits an increase in borrowings of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate subject to additional lender commitments and certain other conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used for capital expenditures and working capital and general corporate purposes of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The ABL Credit Facility provides for loans and standby letters of credit in an amount up to the aggregate availability under the facility, subject to meeting certain borrowing base conditions, with sub-limits of the lesser of 10% of the total facility commitment and $5.0 million for swingline loans and $10.0 million for letters of credit. The ABL Credit Facility has a five-year maturity and will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
    
  At the option of the borrowers, loans under the ABL Credit Facility initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to (i) 2.00% plus LIBOR or (ii) 1.00% plus a base rate, subject to a 0.50% step-down based on the previous quarter s excess availability.  
    
  The Partnership must also pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments to the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility equal to (a) 0.375% per annum for the first full calendar quarter after the closing date and (b) thereafter, (i) 0.375% per annum if utilization under the facility is less than 50% of the total commitments and (ii) 0.25% per annum if utilization under the facility is equal to or greater than 50% of the total commitments. The borrowers must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to 2.00%, subject to a 0.50% step-down based on the previous quarter s excess availability, on the maximum amount available to be drawn under, and customary facing fees equal to 0.125% of the face amount of, each letter of credit. 

50 

     Table of Contents     

The ABL Credit Facility also contains customary covenants for a financing of this type that limit the ability of the Credit Parties and their subsidiaries to, among other things, incur liens, engage in a consolidation, merger, purchase or sale of assets, pay dividends, incur indebtedness, make advances, investments and loans, enter into affiliate transactions, issue equity interests, or create subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries. The ABL Credit Facility also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant, as defined therein. The Partnership was in compliance with the covenants of the ABL Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership and its subsidiaries had availability under the ABL Credit Facility of   $48.0 million  . There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Capital Spending 
    
  Our total capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $18.3 million  . We divide our capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes only non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. We also treat maintenance capital spending as a reduction of cash available for distribution to unitholders. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity, improvement in product yields and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. Major scheduled turnaround expenses are expensed when incurred. 
    
  Capital spending for our business has been and will be determined by the Board of Directors of our general partner. The following table summarizes our total actual capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and current estimated capital expenditures for 2016 by major category: 

_____________ 
           (1) 
    Includes amounts already spent during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for the Coffeyville Facility and amounts already spent during the six months ended   September 30, 2016   for the East Dubuque Facility. 
     An ammonia synthesis converter was replaced at the East Dubuque Facility during the second quarter of 2016. The new ammonia synthesis converter is expected to increase reliability, production and plant efficiency. Growth capital expenditures for the ammonia synthesis converter were $7.4 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Future capital spending estimates may change as a result of unforeseen circumstances and a change in our plans and may be revised from time to time or amounts may not be spent in the manner discussed herein. Planned capital expenditures for   2016   are subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects. For example, we may experience increases in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of our nitrogen fertilizer plants.  
  Major Scheduled Turnaround Expenditures 
  Consistent, safe and reliable operations are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. Unplanned downtime of either plant may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a temporary increase in working capital investment and related inventory position. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is mitigated through a diligent planning process that takes into account margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance, feedstock logistics and other factors.  
  Historically, the East Dubuque Facility has also undergone a full facility turnaround every two to three years. The East Dubuque Facility underwent a full facility turnaround in the second quarter of 2016, at a cost of approximately $6.6 million. The Partnership is planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility in 2018. 
  Historically, the Coffeyville Facility has undergone a full facility turnaround every two to three years. The Coffeyville Facility underwent a full facility turnaround in the third quarter of 2015, at a cost of approximately $7.0 million. The Partnership is  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents     

planning to undergo the next scheduled full facility turnaround at the Coffeyville Facility in the second half of 2017, which is expected to last approximately 15 days.  
  Distributions to Unitholders 
    
  The board of directors of the Partnership's general partner has a policy for the Partnership to distribute all available cash generated on a quarterly basis. Our policy is disclosed in   Note 8 ("Partners  Capital and Partnership Distributions")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 

______________________________ 
    
  (1) The distribution per common unit for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is calculated based on the post-merger common units outstanding.

Cash Flows 
    
  The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below: 

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
    
  For purposes of this cash flow discussion, we define trade working capital as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Other working capital is defined as all other current assets and liabilities except trade working capital. 
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $47.5 million  . Fluctuations in trade working capital increased our operating cash flow by $37.2 million due to a decrease in inventory of $32.2 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.4 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.6 million. The decrease in inventory was primarily attributable to decrease in finished goods inventory as a result of increased sales volumes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Fluctuations in other working capital of $27.5 million decreased our operating cash flow and were due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $27.7 million, a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.0 million, partially offset by a decrease to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were approximately $57.1 million. Fluctuations in trade working capital increased our operating cash flow by $1.5 million due to an increase in accounts payable of $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $1.1 million and accounts receivable of $0.7 million. The increase in accounts payable was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses related to the 2015 turnaround and increased repairs and maintenance. Fluctuations in other working capital of $11.3 million decreased our operating cash flow and were due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $11.2 million, a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to lower market demand for prepaid contracts and decreased sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases in balances related to accrued railcar regulatory inspections of $2.7 million due to a larger portion of our fleet due for regulatory inspections and repairs during 2014, freight expense associated with lower sales of $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the accrual of sales tax related to the railcar purchases for the period ending September 30, 2014. The decrease in prepaid expenses was primarily attributable to the timing of insurance payments, a decrease in intercompany amounts due from CRRM that include the transfer of hydrogen and other less significant changes. 
    
     Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $82.1 million   compared to   $12.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was the result of cash merger consideration of   $63.9 million  , net of cash acquired, and was the result of capital expenditures of   $18.3 million  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures. 

53 

     Table of Contents     

Cash Flows Provided by or Used in Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $49.9 million  , compared to net cash flows used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $91.4 million  . The net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to the financing transactions discussed in   Liquidity and Capital Resources   above, partially offset by the quarterly cash distributions and the purchase of 400,000 CVR Nitrogen common units from CVR Energy for $5.0 million as discussed in   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The net cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to quarterly cash distributions. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  We are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations.   See Note 14 ("Commitments and Contingencies")   in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for more information. The following table summarizes our minimum payments as of   September 30, 2016   relating to long-term debt, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations with third parties and affiliates and interest payments for the five years ending December 31, 2020 and thereafter. 

_____________ 

(2)  
    We lease various facilities and equipment, primarily railcars, under non-cancelable operating leases for various periods. 
       
           (3)  
    The amounts include commitments under a product supply agreement with Linde for the Coffeyville Facility that expires in 2020, a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation for the Coffeyville Facility that expires in December 2016, a utility service agreement with Jo-Carroll Energy, Inc. that expires in June 2019, natural gas supply agreements for the East Dubuque Facility that expire in a period of less than six months and other less significant commitments. 
       
           (4)  
    The amounts include commitments under our long-term pet coke supply agreement between CRNF and CRRM to supply pet coke to the Coffeyville Facility, having an initial term that ends in 2027, subject to renewal. The Partnership's purchase obligations for pet coke from CRRM have been derived from a calculation of the average pet coke price paid to CRRM over the preceding two-year period. 
       
           (5)  
    Interest payments are based on stated interest rates for our long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and also includes commitment fee on the unutilized commitments of the ABL Credit Facility. 

54 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any "off-balance sheet arrangements" as such term is defined within the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Refer to   Note 3 ("Recent Accounting Pronouncements")   to Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the Partnership. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In order to apply these principles, management must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of our   2015   Form 10-K. No modifications have been made to our critical accounting policies and estimates, other than the goodwill discussion below. 
  Goodwill 
  To comply with ASC 350,   Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   ("ASC 350"), we perform a test for goodwill impairment annually, or more frequently in the event we determine that a triggering event has occurred. Our annual testing is performed as of November 1 of each year. Based on a significant decline in market capitalization and lower cash flow forecasts resulting from weakened fertilizer pricing trends during the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership identified a triggering event and therefore performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016. 
  The Partnership's goodwill is entirely allocated to the Coffeyville Facility reporting unit. The goodwill impairment quantitative testing involves a two-step process. Step 1 compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The carrying amount of the reporting unit was less than its fair value; therefore, a Step 2 was not required to be completed and no impairment was recorded. 
   The reporting unit fair value is based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, one of which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved ("Discounted Cash Flow" or "DCF"). Assumptions used in the DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. Forecasted cash flows require management to make judgments and assumptions, including estimates of future fertilizer pricing. Further decline in the fertilizer pricing market or other changes in assumptions may result in a change in management's estimate and result in an impairment in future periods. 
  We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in the DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective. We also utilized fair value estimates derived from the market approach utilizing the public company market multiple method, which required us to make assumptions about the applicability of those multiples to our Coffeyville Facility reporting unit.  
  The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17 percent based upon the results of the Step 1 test as of September 30, 2016. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in management s estimates used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and are consistent with what management believes would be utilized by the primary market participant. The use of alternate judgments and assumptions could result in the requirement to complete Step 2 and, pending those results, potential recognition of different levels of impairment charges in our financial statements.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Commodity Price, Foreign Currency Exchange and Non-Operating Risks 
    
  We are exposed to significant market risk due to potential changes in prices for fertilizer products and natural gas. Natural gas is the primary raw material used in the production of various nitrogen-based products manufactured at our East Dubuque Facility. We have commitments to purchase natural gas for use in our East Dubuque Facility on the spot market, and through short-term, fixed supply, fixed price and index price purchase contracts. Natural gas prices have fluctuated during the last several years, increasing substantially in 2008 and subsequently declining to the current lower levels. A hypothetical increase of $0.10 per MMBtu of natural gas would increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonia at the East Dubuque Facility by approximately   $3.32  . 
    
  In the normal course of business, we produce nitrogen-based fertilizer products throughout the year to supply the needs of our customers during the high-delivery-volume spring and fall seasons. The value of fertilizer product inventory is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the relevant commodity prices. Prices of nitrogen fertilizer products can be volatile. We believe that market prices of nitrogen products are affected by changes in grain prices and demand, natural gas prices and other factors. In the opinion of our management, there is no derivative financial instrument that correlates effectively with, and has a trading volume sufficient to hedge, our firm commitments and forecasted commodity sales transactions. 
    
  We do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to changes in prices of commodities (e.g., UAN, ammonia, natural gas or pet coke). Given that our business is currently based entirely in the United States, we are not directly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not engage in activities that expose us to speculative or non-operating risks, including derivative trading activities. Our management may, in the future, elect to use derivative financial instruments consistent with our overall business objectives to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit, to the extent practical, risks associated with our operating activities.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have evaluated, under the direction of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership s management, including our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of any such system, there can be no assurance that any design will always succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There has been no material change in our internal control over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except as noted below regarding the East Dubuque Merger. 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen and CVR Nitrogen GP whereby we acquired the East Dubuque Facility. Refer to   Note 4 ("East Dubuque Merger")   of Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information regarding the East Dubuque Merger. Management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the acquired business as of   September 30, 2016  .  The revenues attributable to the East Dubuque Facility represent approximately   41%   and   34%   of our consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The assets of the East Dubuque Facility represent   62%   of our consolidated assets as of   September 30, 2016  . This acquisition is material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and the integration following this business combination is likely to materially impact the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

  You should carefully consider the information regarding certain factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations as set forth under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Form 10-K, March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q, and, our June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q.

PLEASE NOTE: Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we may file or incorporate by reference agreements referenced as exhibits to the reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC. The agreements are filed to provide investors with information regarding their respective terms. The agreements are not intended to provide any other factual information about the Partnership, its business or operations. In particular, the assertions embodied in any representations, warranties and covenants contained in the agreements may be subject to qualifications with respect to knowledge and materiality different from those applicable to investors and may be qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules not included with the exhibits. These disclosure schedules may contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements. Moreover, certain representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may have changed after the date of the respective agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Partnership s public disclosures. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Partnership, its business or operations on the date hereof.
