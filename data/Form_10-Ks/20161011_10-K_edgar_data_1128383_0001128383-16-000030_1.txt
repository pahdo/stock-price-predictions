PART I:  
      ITEM 1: Business.  
   Nevada Classic Thoroughbreds, Inc. (henceforth referred to as  NCT  or the  company ) has developed a thoroughbred racing and breeding stallion, proprietary horse racing structure. The company is specialized, making it possible for one or two people to maintain the operation of the company.  
   The company's proprietary solution to the horse racing industry's challenge is   Power Genetics     Mathematical Racing Numbers    (   PGMRN   ), pre-potent characteristics in horses that can reproduce themselves.  
    MARKET  
   There are three distinct markets for the company's horses.  
   The first market is to race company horses in "claiming races." The claiming race is to enable people to buy the company's horses at the racetrack. This is a viable means of eliminating horses that are good but not quite able to compete at the top level of horse racing.  
   The second market is racing income from the racetrack. When the race horse races and performs well, NCT will receive income, or "purse money," from the winnings.  
   The third market is for the syndication of stallions. The stallions that possess outstanding pedigrees, conformation, and race records are syndicated into breeding shares. A breeding share entitles the share owner to breed one mare to the stallion in any one particular breeding season for the duration of the stallion's life.  
   The company is not dependent on only a few customers, since the horse racing industry's market is virtually nationwide, where the horses can be purchased or sold virtually throughout the entire United States. The company is not limited by its customers or limited by the location of its selected horses. These stallions are, almost without exception, readily available and accessible.  
   The company does not require governmental approval or licensing for any of its stallion racing or breeding prospects. However, the racetrack requires a normal training license where the horse is intended to race. The licensing is to provide safety for the horse and riders who train and compete at that specific track.

    ITEM 1A: Risk Factors.  
 The Company is a high-risk/reward company. The risks are substantial and varied. At the present time, the Company's only shareholders are officers, directors, or sophisticated and accredited investors. The following risk factors are only a sample of the problems and risks the Company faces. 
  1. The Skill or Art of Horse Racing  
 The Company's business is an art or skill, each horse being unique and non-duplicable. The costs of training, developing, and racing horses is the same whether the horse is a great money-earner or a complete loss. The trainers, groomers, and all those employed in handling of the race horses is solely a  skill and unique to each individual horse. Each end product is a unique creation of art through the skill of all those participating in its development. As such any one of the many individuals failing to do their job at its utmost could result in a horse being completely worthless. 
  2.  Research and Development Implementation  
 The Company has, through its research and development as of June 30, 2016, developed criteria that gives the Company an advantage, and if such criteria is met, the horse has a 80% chance of earnings over $1 million. The Company did a random sample of stallions in the Blood Horse magazine that had earnings less than $100,000, and found that none of these horses met the Company's criteria for purchase. The Company randomly selected 30 horses that met the Company's criteria, 25 of which had earnings over $1 million. The problem the Company faces is that the Company will only be able to purchase or breed one race horse, given its financial restraints. Thus, there is a good probability that the chosen horse will not run as expected and will be a part of the 17% of horses meeting the Company's criteria, but that did not race well. 
  3.  Perfect Combinations  
 Unfortunately, for any horse earning over $1 million, it must have a perfect combination of breeding, training, health, grooming, safety during transport, and numerous other factors relating to that one horse. Any one phase of the horse's development that is not perfect, could result in the horse being completely worthless as a race horse.

PART II:  
      ITEM 5: Market for Registrant's Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.  
   There are no markets for the company's securities. The company is inactive at the present time.  
   The company intends to obtain a market maker for the company's common stock and horse preferred stock.  
   The market for the company's stock is in the heart of the horse racing and gaming industry. One or more market makers in either of the states of Kentucky, California, Nevada, or New York would suit the needs of the investors as well as providing the company with representation in the horse racing industry, thereby giving investors the flexibility of various security goals and the company with its liquidity to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The company needs to meet the needs of its shareholders in their buying and selling of the company's securities, and in their investment objections, having available horse preferred stock in the horses the company acquires. Investors may want the the  potential capital appreciation of the company's horses. 
       ITEM 6: Selected Financial Data.  

    Not required. 
       ITEM 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 
    
    The company is now inactive, and plans to remain inactive until such time as new liquidity can be acquired for the purpose of purchasing additional stallion prospects.  
     RESULT OF OPERATIONS  
    Research and Development Implementation  
   The Company has, through its research and development as of June 30, 2016, developed criteria that gives the Company an advantage, and if such criteria is met, the horse has an 80% chance of earnings over $1 million. The Company did a random sample of stallions in the Blood Horse magazine that had earnings less than $100,000, and found that none of these horses met the Company's criteria for purchase. The Company randomly selected 30 horses that met the Company's criteria, 25 of which had earnings over $1 million. The problem the Company faces is that the Company will only be able to purchase or breed one race horse, given its financial restraints. Thus, there is a good probability that the chosen horse will not run as expected and will be a part of the 17% of horses meeting the Company's criteria, but that did not race well. 
    Perfect Combinations  
   Unfortunately, for any horse earning over $1 million, it must have a perfect combination of breeding, training, health, grooming, safety during transport, and numerous other factors relating to that one horse. Any one phase of the horse's development that is not perfect, could result in the horse being completely worthless as a race horse. 
    MARKET MAKING   
    The company is in the process of obtaining a market maker for its stock, and anticipates being on the Pink Sheets until the company meets the
    requirements of the OTC Bulletin Board. While the company is in the process
    of securing a market maker, there can be no guarantees that a market maker
    will be available, or that the company will meet their requirements in order
    to make a market for the company's securities. 
     FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   
    The Company expects to remain inactive. The Board of Directors intends to pay a substantial portion of the company's expenses, as determined on an on-going basis by the Board of Directors, until such time as the company is able to produce a profit.  
   The officers and directors have paid the majority of the company's expenses.  
      ITEM 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
     Power Genetics Mathematical Racing Numbers  (PGMRN)     
     COMPETITION  
    The competition is catching up to the company in one aspect of NCT's proprietary   PGMRN   Number Indexes, specifically Index 6. For example,  Lost In The Fog , a horse-of-the-year candidate in 2005, won ten straight races before being defeated in the Breeders Cup Championship Series Sprint race.  Lost In The Fog  was analyzed by a company that analyzes efficiency of stride. According to the Breeders Cup announcers, they analyzed length of stride and time in the air, and he was selected for this quality. This would imply that some individuals are beginning to understand and apply the relationship of Index 6 to a quality of the race horse.  
    The competition is still behind the company in using the total Power Numbers in selecting horses for breeding and racing. The indicators are that some owners and trainers are willing to go through the expense of analyzing Index indicator Number 6 to help in their selection process, especially the select Kentucky sales, where horses are sold for millions of dollars. However, the other indicators seem to be unnoticed at the present time in comparing horses that have good indicators to those that do not. Their price seems to be relatively the same, and no correspondence seems to exist between the poor and good indicators and the prices at which they are sold. The thoroughbred sales in California and Texas have usually less expensive horses, and it is rare that anyone would go to the expense of analyzing these horses because of their lower auction prices. This gives the company a big advantage. The company can see the horses a day before the sale, analyze hundreds of horses using the complete Power Index Numbers rather than just Index 6, and purchase or bid on horses that have the complete package.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
    JUNE 30, 2016  
      NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   The company uses SOP 85-3, breeding horses under development. The horse
    evaluation is adding in direct costs to the value of the horses under
    development. The value is the lower of cost or established market value,
    until breeding maturity, then the horses are depreciated through the life
    of the breeding career. Pursuant to discussions with staff of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission in January of 2006 and in keeping with SOP 85-3
    regarding evaluations of breeding stock, the following accounting practices
  have been adopted and adjustments as of March 31, 2006. 
   Any financial statements prior to March 31, 2006 will be inaccurate, as they
    do not reflect SOP 85-3, breeding horses under development, and should not
    be relied upon for any meaningful representations of the company's financial
    position. 
    Accounting Estimates   
   Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were used.  
    Income Taxes   
   Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income and between the basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled as prescribed in FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.  
    Net (Loss) Per Share   
   The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 that requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. In accordance with FASB 128, any anti-dilutive effects on net loss per share are excluded.  
    Long-Lived Assets   
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable.

 The Company has elected to account for stock-based compensation under APB
  Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation expense has been recognized for
  stock options granted to employees at fair market value. 
   A summary of the option activity for the period from November 1, 2000 to June
  30, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the plan is as follows: 
   
   All shares are exercisable.

Information regarding stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2016 is as
  follows, not including the 20:1 stock split: 
   
   The weighted average fair market value of options granted in the period of
  November 1, 2000 to June 30, 2016 were estimated as of the date of grant using
  the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model, based on the following weighted
  average assumptions: 

Dividend yield 
        0

Expected volatility  
        50%

Risk fee interest rate  
        5.7%

Expected life  
        Exercisable

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair market value of the
  options, if any, is amortized to expense over the options' vesting periods. 
   Under the Black-Scholes model, the options did not have any intrinsic value.
  Therefore, pro forma disclosure information has not been presented.

When the company becomes active and a cash flow develops, these tasks will be broken out as the company is able to locate qualified persons to fulfill these jobs.

    ITEM 9: Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  
 None. 
    ITEM 9A: Controls and Procedures  
  Effectiveness of the Company's Controls and Procedures   
 The company maintains disclosures controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing these duties, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   The company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing these duties, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules). At the present time, the company is an inactive filer, with minimal expense transactions each month and no earnings whatsoever. Because of this, the company's financial statements are unaudited. The company's management performs the function of audit committee, and has detected errors in its financial reports, which errors are not in any way related to earnings or expenditures, but merely to the manner in which cumulative balances have been reported. Such errors have been corrected in the company's June 2005 10KSB/A. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a  significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  The aforementioned errors are considered to be minor, and thus not  material  weaknesses, significant deficiencies, or a combination of significant deficiencies.  
   Based upon the company's most recent evaluation, the company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (or persons performing those duties), concluded the company's disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are adequate and effective as of June 30, 2016. The effectiveness of the company's controls and procedures are an on-going process of continual improvement. As such, when the company becomes active, with earnings to report and audited financial statements, the company's disclosure controls and procedures may require restructuring. 
   There has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting or any other factor that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      
   Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ) were effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i ) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
    Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls      
   The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  

(i)  
         pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 

(ii)  
         provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and  

(iii)  
         provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
    Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
   The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
   There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during its fourth quarter of 2016, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
      in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
      which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
      to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
      management or other employees who have a significant role in the
      registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
