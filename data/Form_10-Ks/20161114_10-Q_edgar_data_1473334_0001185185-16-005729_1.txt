NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 (UNAUDITED)

Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business

Nova LifeStyle, Inc. ( Nova LifeStyle  or the  Company ), formerly known as Stevens Resources, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 9, 2009.

The Company is a U.S. holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests of our subsidiaries through which we market, design, manufacture and sell furniture worldwide: Nova Furniture Ltd. ( Nova Samoa ), Bright Swallow International Group Limited ( Bright Swallow  or  BSI ), Nova Furniture Macao Commercial Offshore Limited ( Nova Macao ), and Diamond Bar Outdoors, Inc. ( Diamond Bar ).

Nova Macao was organized under the laws of Macao on May 20, 2006. Nova Macao is wholly owned of the Company.  Diamond Bar, doing business as Diamond Sofa, was incorporated in California on June 15, 2000.  Nova Macao is a trading company, importing, marketing and selling products designed and manufactured by Nova Furniture (Dongguan) Co., Ltd. ( Nova Dongguan ) and third party manufacturers for the U.S. and international markets. Diamond Bar markets and sells products manufactured by us and third party manufacturers under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers principally in the U.S. market.  On April 24, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Bright Swallow, an established furniture company with a global client base.  

The sale of four of our former subsidiaries, Nova Furniture Limited ( Nova Furniture BVI ), Nova Dongguan, Nova Dongguan Chinese Style Furniture Museum ( Nova Museum ), and Dongguan Ding Nuo Household Products Co., Ltd. ( Ding Nuo ), was consummated on October 25, 2016 (See Note 3   Discontinued Operations).   Nova Dongguan is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE, and was incorporated under the laws of the PRC on June 6, 2003. Nova Dongguan organized Nova Museum on March 17, 2011 as a non-profit organization under the laws of the PRC engaged in the promotion of the culture and history of furniture in China. Nova Dongguan markets and sells products in China to stores in our franchise network and to wholesalers and agents for domestic retailers and exporters. Nova Dongguan also provides design expertise and facilities to manufacture branded products and products for international markets under original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer agreements, or ODM and OEM agreements.  On October 24, 2013, Nova Dongguan incorporated Ding Nuo under the laws of the PRC and contributed capital of RMB 1 million ($162,994). Nova Dongguan made an additional capital contribution of RMB 0.1 million ($16,305) on November 27, 2013 through one of Nova Dongguan s officers who acts as the nominee shareholder of Ding Nuo. All of the nominee shareholder s shares were put in escrow and trust with Nova Dongguan and all profits and losses of Ding Nuo will be distributed to Nova Dongguan; accordingly, Nova Dongguan effectively controls 100% of Ding Nuo.  Ding Nuo was established mainly for engaging in business with IKEA.

The  Company  and  Nova  collectively refer to Nova LifeStyle, the U.S. parent, and its subsidiaries, Nova Samoa, Nova Macao, Diamond Bar, and BSI.  The  Company  may also from time to time in these Notes include the Company s former subsidiaries, Nova Furniture BVI, Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum and Ding Nuo.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The interim condensed consolidated financial information as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have not been included. The interim condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).

Table of Contents 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include all significant normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016, its interim condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.

Use of Estimates

In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include, but are not limited to, the allowance for bad debt, valuation of inventories, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and fair value of warrant derivative liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Further information regarding significant estimates can be found in the 2015 Form 10-K.

Business Combination

For a business combination, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. In a business combination achieved in stages, the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, are recognized at the full amounts of their fair values. In a bargain purchase in which the total acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree that excess in earnings is recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer.

Deferred tax liability and asset are recognized for the deferred tax consequences of differences between the tax bases and the recognized values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740-10.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with ASC Topic 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment, annually or more frequently when circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing is performed at a reporting unit level. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, with the fair value of the reporting unit determined using discounted cash flow ( DCF ) analysis. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF analysis to forecast operating cash flows, including the discount rate, the internal rate of return and projections of realizations and costs to produce. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated.

ASC Topic 350 also permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to be performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Performing the qualitative assessment involved identifying the relevant drivers of fair value, evaluating the significance of all identified relevant events and circumstances, and weighing the factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After evaluating and weighing all these relevant events and circumstances, it was concluded that a positive assertion can be made from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of Diamond Bar is greater than its carrying amount. As such, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for Diamond Bar reporting unit.  Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company concluded there was no impairment of goodwill of Diamond Bar.

On April 24, 2013, Nova LifeStyle completed the acquisition of Bright Swallow.  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase is allocated to tangible assets and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values with the excess charged to goodwill. Nova LifeStyle recognized $808,518 of goodwill from the acquisition. In June 2014, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment for Bright Swallow using a two-step impairment test based on Bright Swallow s actual performance for the first six-months of 2014 and updated revenue and expense projections. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that all of the goodwill pertaining to Bright Swallow was impaired in June 2014. The goodwill impairment charge was non-cash. The goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes and, therefore, the Company did not record a corresponding tax benefit in 2014.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

The Company s policy is to maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Based on historical collection activity, the Company recorded $418,887 and $484,936 as allowance for bad debt as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from continuing operations were $33,818 and $651,989, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from continuing operations were $0 and $614,291, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from discontinued operations were $552,611 and $0 respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from discontinued operations were $552,611 and $0, respectively. 

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. Management compares the cost of inventories with the net realizable value and an allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market value, if lower. The Company did not record any write-downs of inventory at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Plant, Property and Equipment and Construction in Progress  

Plant, property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; while additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with 10% salvage value and estimated lives as follows:

Building and workshops

20 years

Computer and office equipment

5 years

Decoration and renovation

10 years

Machinery

10 years

Autos

5 years

Depreciation of plant, property and equipment attributable to manufacturing activities is capitalized as part of inventories, and expensed to cost of goods sold when inventories are sold.

Construction in progress represents capital expenditure in respect of direct costs of construction or acquisition and design fees incurred. Capitalization of these costs ceases and the construction in progress is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use are completed. Construction in progress is not depreciated until such time as the asset is completed and is ready for its intended use. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.

Based on its review, the Company believes that, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no significant impairment of its long-lived assets.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are related primarily to the Company designing and testing its new products during the development stage. Research and development costs are recognized in general and administrative expenses and expensed as incurred. Research and development expense from continuing operations was $94,839 and $104,327 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; $35,174 and $34,394 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Research and development expense from the Company s discontinued operations was $588,790 and $691,378 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; $179,643 and $285,539 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes

In its interim financial statements, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 270  Interim Reporting  and ASC 740  Income Taxes  whereby the Company utilizes the expected annual effective rate in determining its income tax provision.  The actual effective tax rate of continuing operations of 4.81% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, primarily as a result of a tax benefit from the tax-exemption status of Nova Macau and the reversal of tax liability reserves due to statute of limitation expiration, offset by tax liability reserves from uncertain tax positions.  

Nova Lifestyle and Diamond Bar are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Nova Furniture and Bright Swallow were incorporated in the BVI. Nova Samoa was incorporated in Oceania. There is no income tax for companies domiciled in the BVI or Oceania. Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements do not present any income tax provision related to the BVI and Oceania tax jurisdiction where Nova Furniture BVI, BSI and Nova Samoa are domiciled. Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum, and Ding Nuo are governed by the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ) which is subject to a 25% corporate income tax. Nova Museum is subject to a 25% corporate income tax in the first year and allowed to apply for tax-exempt status in the second year following its incorporation. Nova Macao is an income tax-exempt entity incorporated and domiciled in Macao.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax (benefit) and expense from its continuing operations of approximately $60,000 and $112,000, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax (benefit) and expense from its continuing operations of approximately $(203,000) and $48,000, respectively.

As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $4.6 million.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $4.6 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $5.0 million.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $5.0 million as of September 30, 2015.

A reconciliation of the January 1, 2016, through September 30, 2016, amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties ("Gross UTB") is as follows:

At September 30, 2016, the Company had cumulatively accrued approximately $2,244,000 for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, of which $508,000 were related to the Company s continuing operations. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cumulatively accrued approximately $1,913,000 for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense, which totaled approximately $331,000 and $341,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $82,000 and $96,000 were related to the Company s continuing operations; and totaled approximately $99,000 and $116,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $15,000 and $32,000 were related to the Company s continuing operations. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing adjustments between Dongguan and Macau since the intercompany sales between the two entities appears to comply with reasonable arm s length principles.

Nova Dongguan and Ding Nuo are subject to taxation in the PRC. Nova Dongguan s PRC income tax returns are generally not subject to examination by the tax authorities for tax years before 2010. With a few exceptions, the tax years 2010-2015 remain open to examination by tax authorities in the PRC. Unrecognized tax benefit related to transfer pricing adjustment between Dongguan and Macau is generally not subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities for tax years before 2005.  The tax years 2012-2015 for US entities remain open to examination by tax authorities in the US.

Revenue Recognition

The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  Sales revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed and no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. No revenue is recognized if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return of the goods. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.

Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added taxes ( VAT ). All of the Company s products sold in China are subject to the PRC VAT of 17% of the gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials purchased in China and included in the cost of producing the finished product. The Company records VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the consolidated financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables. Sales and purchases are recorded net of VAT collected and paid as the Company acts as an agent for the government.

The Company s sales policy allows for the return of product within the warranty period if the product is defective and the defects are the Company s fault.  As alternatives for the product return option, the customers have options of asking a discount from the Company for the products with quality issues or receiving replacement parts from the Company at no cost. The amount for return of products, the discount provided to the Company s customers and the cost for replacement parts were immaterial for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Franchise Arrangements  

In 2010, the Company began entering into area product franchise agreements with franchisees who operate specialty furniture stores carrying only Nova-branded products. The product franchise agreement provides for the franchisee to retail Nova-brand furniture products for a period of one year from the date of the agreement. The franchisee is required to pay a deposit of RMB 30,000 at the signing of the agreement, which is used as payment for future purchases and is deferred on the Company s balance sheet as a customer deposit. The franchisee is required to guarantee a minimum purchase amount from the Company during the contract period. The Company has the right to terminate the agreement should the franchisee fail to meet the minimum purchase amount. The Company provides the franchisee with store images and designs, signage, floor plan product information and training. In addition, the Company will rebate a per square meter subsidy to the franchisee for the store build-out within 12 months from the agreement date.  Under the program, the Company has established standard renovation amounts (the  Renovation Subsidy ) for various cities in China.  The franchisee is able to obtain, in the form of credits against purchase orders, percentages of the Renovation Subsidy applicable in the city in which the franchisee is located, as follows: 0% to 30% of the Renovation Subsidy applied to the first purchase order and 5% of each purchase order thereafter until the aggregate of all credits equals 100% of the Renovation Subsidy, or 12 months from the date of the franchise agreement, whichever occurs first. In accordance with ASC 605-50, as the Company does not receive an identifiable benefit from these rebates, the rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue on sales to the franchisees.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales consists primarily of finished goods purchased from other manufacturers, material costs, labor costs and related overhead that are directly attributable to the production of the products. Write-down of inventory to the lower of cost or market value is also recorded in the cost of sales.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs related to delivery of finished goods are included in selling expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs from continuing operations were $2,033 and $5,043, respectively; during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs from continuing operations were $313 and $1,019, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs from discontinued operations were $373,123 and $432,520, respectively; during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs from discontinued operations were $137,308 and $135,640, respectively.

Advertising  

Advertising expenses consist primarily of costs of promotion and marketing for the Company s image and products, and costs of direct advertising, and are included in selling expenses. The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense from continuing operations was $2,156,451 and $1,250,169 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $841,345 and $622,990 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Share-based compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which requires that share-based payment transactions with employees be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instrument issued and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.

The Company accounts for share-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and FASB ASC Subtopic 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees . Share-based compensation associated with the issuance of equity instruments to non-employees is measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued or committed to be issued, as this is more reliable than the fair value of the services received. The fair value is measured at the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached or the counterparty's performance is complete.

Earnings per Share (EPS)

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares pertaining to warrants, stock options, and similar instruments had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings per share are based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options and warrants were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding unvested restricted stock, options and warrants, and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible instruments. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later) and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, outstanding convertible instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later).

The following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, warrants to purchase 1,925,001 and 2,050,001 shares of common stock were outstanding and exercisable, respectively.  For the nine months and three ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 1,925,001 and 2,050,001 shares purchasable under warrants were excluded from EPS, respectively, as their effects were anti-dilutive.  For all the periods presented, the unvested restricted stock were anti-dilutive.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of accounts and other receivables. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support these receivables. The Company conducts periodic reviews of the financial condition and payment practices of its customers to minimize collection risk on accounts receivable.

A customer accounted for 10% of the Company s sales for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016. No customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company s sales for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015.

The Company purchased its products from four major vendors during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and from four major vendors during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, accounting for a total of 59% (20%, 15%, 12% and 12% for each) and 76% (28%, 18%, 16% and 14% for each) of the Company s purchases, respectively. Five vendors accounted for 89% (22%, 17%, 17%, 17% and 16%, respectively) of the purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and three major vendors for 70% (28% 22% and 20% for each) during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Accounts payable to these vendors were $4,380,683 and $3,404,189 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The operations of the Company are located principally in China and the US. Accordingly, the Company s Chinese subsidiaries' business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in China, as well as by the general state of the PRC economy.

The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments in China and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in PRC government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.

The Company s sales, purchase and expense transactions in China are denominated in Chinese Yuan Renminbi ( RMB ), and all of the assets and liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries in China are also denominated in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies under the current law. In China, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions. Remittances in currencies other than RMB may require certain supporting documentation in order to affect the remittance.

Statement of Cash Flows

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230,  Statement of Cash Flows,  cash flows from the Company s operations is calculated based upon local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows may not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Some of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, have carrying amounts that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments,  defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC Topic 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,  and ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging. 

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, advance to suppliers, other receivables, accounts payable, line of credit, advance from customers, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate estimated fair values because of their short maturities.  The estimated fair value of the long-term lines of credit approximated the carrying amount as of September 30, 2016, as the interest rates are considered as approximate to the current rate for comparable loans at the respective balance sheet dates.

The carrying value of the warrant liability is determined using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model. Certain assumptions used in the calculation of the warrant liability represent Level-3 unobservable inputs. The Company did not have any assets or liabilities categorized as Level 1 or 2 as of September 30, 2016.

The following table summarizes the activity of Level 3 inputs measured on a recurring basis:

Fair Value Measurements of Common Stock Warrants Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)

Table of Contents 

(a)    Adjustment resulting from change in fair value  is the amount of total gains or losses for the period attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to liabilities held at the reporting date. The unrealized gain or loss is recorded in change in fair value of warrant liability in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD. The functional currency of Nova LifeStyle, Nova Samoa, Nova Furniture BVI, Nova Macao, Bright Swallow and Diamond Bar is the United States Dollar ( $  or  USD ). The functional currency of Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum and Ding Nuo is RMB. The functional currencies of the Company s foreign operations are translated into USD for balance sheet accounts using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, except for the equity account using the historical exchange rate, and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, captioned  Accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in  Other income (expenses)  in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. There have been no significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date.

The RMB to USD exchange rates in effect as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were RMB6.6778 = USD$1.00 and RMB6.4936 = USD$1.00, respectively. The weighted-average RMB to USD exchange rates in effect for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were RMB6.5771= USD$1.00 and RMB6.1738= USD$1.00, respectively. The exchange rates used in translation from RMB to USD were published by the People s Bank of the People s Republic of China.

Comprehensive Income

The Company follows FASB ASC 220  Reporting Comprehensive Income.  Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the consolidated statements of stockholders  equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. Comprehensive income for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Segment Reporting  

ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting,  requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.

Management determined that the Company s operations constitute a single reportable segment in accordance with ASC 280. The Company operates exclusively in one business and industry segment: the design, manufacture and sale of furniture. All of the Company s long-lived assets for production are located at its facilities in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China, and operate within the same environmental, safety and quality regulations governing furniture manufacturers. The Company established Nova Macao and Ding Nuo, and acquired Diamond Bar and Bright Swallow for the purpose of marketing and selling the Company s products. As a result, management views the business and operations of Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, Diamond Bar, Bright Swallow and Ding Nuo as a blended gross margin when determining future growth, return on investment and cash flows. Nova Museum, a non-profit organization engaged principally in the promotion and dissemination of the culture and history of furniture in China, has no operations or substantial assets other than its decorations and renovation, and its heritage and cultural assets are for the purpose of exhibition only.

Accordingly, management concluded that the Company had one reportable segment under ASC 280 because: (i) the Company s products sold through Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, and Ding Nuo are created with similar production processes, in the same facilities, under the same regulatory environment and sold to customers using similar distribution systems; (ii) Diamond Bar is a furniture distributor based in California focusing on customers in the US, and Bright Swallow is a furniture distributor based in Hong Kong focusing on customers in Canada, they both are operated under the same senior management of Nova Dongguan and Nova Macao, and management views the operations of Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, Diamond Bar, Bright Swallow and Ding Nuo as a whole for making business decisions; and (iii) although Nova Museum is principally engaged in the dissemination of the culture and history of furniture in China, it also serves a function of promoting and marketing the Company s image and products by providing a platform and channel for consumers to be exposed to the Company and its products, it is operated under the same management with the same resources and in the same location as Nova Dongguan, and it is an additive and supplemental unit to the Company s main operations, the manufacture and sale of furniture.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the reporting entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If the entity is in such a position, the standard provides for certain disclosures depending on whether or not the entity will be able to successfully mitigate its going concern status. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect that these ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17 Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control. This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 18 - Statutory Reserves

As a U.S. holding company, the Company s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its subsidiaries. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company s PRC subsidiary, Nova Macao, only out of the subsidiary s retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of Nova Macao. Pursuant to the corporate laws of the PRC and Macao, including the PRC Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment, Nova Macao is required to maintain a statutory reserve by appropriating from after-tax profit before declaration or payment of dividends. The statutory reserve represents restricted retained earnings. As a result of the PRC laws and regulations described below that require such annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax income to be set aside prior to payment of dividends as a general statutory reserve fund, Nova Macao is restricted in its ability to transfer a portion of its net assets to the Company as a dividend.

Surplus Reserve Fund

Prior to the Company s divestment of Nova BVI, Nova Dongguan and Ding Nuo were required to transfer 10% of net income, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a statutory surplus reserve fund until such reserve balance reaches 50% of the subsidiary s registered capital. The surplus reserve fund is non-distributable other than during liquidation and can be used to fund previous years  losses, if any, and may be utilized for business expansion or converted into share capital by issuing new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings or by increasing the par value of the shares currently held by them, provided that the remaining reserve balance after such issuance is not less than 25% of the registered capital.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Nova Macao had surplus reserves of $6,241, representing 50% of its registered capital. Nova Dongguan and Ding Nuo did not make any transfer to surplus reserves due to their accumulated deficit.

Common Welfare Fund

The common welfare fund is a voluntary fund to which Nova Macao can elect to transfer 5% to 10% of its net income. This fund can only be utilized on capital items for the collective benefit of the subsidiary s employees, such as construction of dormitories, cafeteria facilities, and other staff welfare facilities. This fund is non-distributable other than upon liquidation. Nova Macao does not participate in this voluntary fund.

We are a U.S. holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests of our wholly owned subsidiaries through which we market, design, manufacture and sell residential furniture worldwide: Nova Samoa, Nova Macao, Bright Swallow, and Diamond Bar. Nova Macao was organized under the laws of Macao on May 20, 2006. Nova Macao is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nova Lifestyle.  Diamond Bar is a California corporation organized on June 15, 2000, which we acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement on August 31, 2011.  On April 24, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bright Swallow; the purchase price was $6.5 million in cash and was fully paid at the closing of the acquisition.  

On October 24, 2013, Nova Dongguan incorporated Ding Nuo under the laws of the PRC and contributed capital of RMB 1 million ($162,994). Nova Dongguan made an additional capital contribution of RMB 0.1 million ($16,305) on November 27, 2013 through one of Nova Dongguan s officers, Mr. Gu XingChang, who acts as the nominee shareholder of Ding Nuo. All of the nominee shareholder s shares were put in escrow and trust with Nova Dongguan and all profits and losses of Ding Nuo will be distributed to Nova Dongguan. Accordingly, although 90.91% of the outstanding capital stock of Ding Nuo is held by Nova Dongguan and 9.09% is held by Mr. Gu XingChang, Nova Dongguan effectively controls 100% of Ding Nuo.  Ding Nuo was established mainly for engaging in business with IKEA.

IKEA has strict standards and processes to choose and qualify its vendors and suppliers.  In order to be qualified as an IKEA supplier, a company must go through a review, inspection and approval process according to IKEA standards which include the supplier s operating history, manufacturing facility and equipment, production capacity, raw materials, employee benefits and work safety, environmental protection and compliance with laws and regulations, among other things.  Nova began the discussions with IKEA to become a supplier in 2012.  In order to expedite the qualification process with IKEA, we decided to incorporate a new company and construct a new facility/workshop in full compliance with IKEA's special requirements. Therefore, we incorporated Ding Nuo, built a manufacturing facility/workshop and leased it to Ding Nuo specifically for engaging in business with IKEA.  In early September 2014, Ding Nuo completed production of an initial purchase order from IKEA.  The purchase was made under a Contract Review Trading Area   Supplier.   IKEA finished installing a Purchase Agreement (the  PUA ) system into Nova s computer system in early October 2014, so that IKEA is able to place future orders through the system for Nova to execute.   Ding Nuo successfully fulfilled IKEA s testing orders (in terms of timing, product quality, delivery and other requirements), and at IKEA s request, completed test manufacturing of certain new styles and furniture for which demand is well-established.  Additionally, Ding Nuo passed IKEA s quality inspection.  IKEA has provided us with a yearly order plan and adjusted the yearly order plan to increase the order volume in June and August of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, IKEA maintained the same order volume as in August of 2015.  During the first quarter of 2016, IKEA s research and development team introduced approximately ten SKUs (i.e., different product lines) to our research and development team.  Prior to the disposal of our subsidiary Nova Furniture BVI, we were  in the process of preparing samples and discussing different construction and material details based on IKEA s proposals.  During the third quarter of 2016, IKEA had confirmed and approved two SKUs.  

Our experience developing and marketing products for international markets has enabled us to develop the scale, logistics, marketing, manufacturing efficiencies and design expertise that serve as the foundation for us to expand aggressively into the highly attractive U.S., Canadian and Chinese markets. On November 10, 2016, Nova Samoa ( Assignor ) entered into a Trademark Assignment Agreement with Kuka Design BVI ( Assignee ).  Pursuant to the terms of the Trademark Assignment Agreement,   Assignor agreed to assign to the Assignee its full right to, and title in, the NOVA trademark in China for $6,000,000 (the  Assignment Fee ).  Assignee shall pay the Assignment Fee in two installments: $1,000,000 on or before November 30, 2016, and $5,000,000 on or before December 31, 2016. A copy of the Trademark Assignment Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(the  Company ), entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Kuka Design Limited, an unrelated company incorporated in British Virgin Islands ( Kuka Design BVI  or  Buyer ). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Seller sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nova Furniture Ltd. in BVI ( Nova Furniture BVI ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller to the Buyer for a total of $8,500,000 (the  Transaction ), which such value was primarily derived from Nova Furniture BVI s direct wholly-owned operating entity Nova Furniture (Dongguan) Co., Ltd. in China ( Nova Dongguan ), and Nova Dongguan s wholly owned subsidiary Nova Dongguan Chinese Style Furniture Museum ( Nova Museum ) and 90.91% owned subsidiary Dongguan Ding Nuo Household Products Co., Ltd. ( Ding Nuo ). In connection with the Transaction, the Company undertook certain restructuring actions prior to the execution of the Agreement, including the following: (i) the Company incorporated a new direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Nova Samoa; (ii) the Company transferred another direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Nova Furniture BVI, to Nova Samoa, whereby Nova Furniture BVI became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Nova Samoa and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and (iii) Nova Furniture BVI transferred its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nova Macao, to the Company, whereby Nova Macao became a direct wholly-owned the subsidiary of the Company. Nova Samoa, Nova Furniture BVI and Nova Macao were all direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company before the consummation of the Transaction.

Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance

Significant factors that we believe could affect our operating results are the (i) cost of raw materials; (ii) prices of our products to our international retailer and wholesaler customers and their markups to end consumers; (iii) consumer acceptance of our new brands and product collections; and (iv) general economic conditions in the U.S., Canadian, Chinese, European and other international markets. We have experienced and anticipate continued fluctuation in raw material costs as a result of world economic conditions, such as the price of stainless and carbon steel. Generally, we can pass raw material cost increases on to our customers, but there may be a time lag as we renegotiate pricing with our customers on existing products and introduce new product collections. We attempt to mitigate short-term risks of raw material price swings in between customer price negotiations by purchasing some raw materials in advance based on forecasted production needs. In addition, we are less susceptible to these short-term raw material pricing risks in the Chinese retail market because we reserve the right under our product franchise agreements to adjust our wholesale and retail product pricing based on raw material price fluctuations, providing franchisees with at least one month s notice prior to price adjustment. We believe most of our customers are willing to pay higher prices for our high quality and stylish products, timely delivery and strong production capacity, which we expect will allow us to maintain high gross profit margins for our products. We have diversified our products by introducing brands and product collections exclusively for China, acquiring the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S. market and developing higher-margin products for the U.S. and international markets, and acquiring Bright Swallow for the Canadian market. Consumer preference trends favoring high quality and stylish products and lifestyle-based furniture suites also should allow us to maintain our high gross profit margins. The markets in North America, and particularly in Europe, remain challenging because such markets are experiencing a slower than anticipated recovery from the recent international financial crisis. However, we believe that discretionary purchases of furniture by middle to upper middle-income consumers, our target global consumer market, will increase along with expected growth in the worldwide furniture trade and the recovery of housing markets. Furthermore, we believe that our expansion of direct sales in the U.S. will have a positive impact on our net sales and net income, while helping to diversify our customer base and end consumer markets.

While our significant accounting policies are described more fully in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this Management Discussion and Analysis.   

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for Nova LifeStyle and its subsidiaries, Diamond Bar, Bright Swallow, Nova Macao and Nova Samoa, and its former subsidiaries, Nova Furniture BVI, Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum and Ding Nuo.

Use of Estimates

In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by us, include, but are not limited to, the allowance for bad debt, valuation of inventories, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and fair value of warrant derivative liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable

Our policy is to maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. We review the composition of accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.  We maintained an allowance for bad debt of $418,887 and $484,936 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from continuing operations were $33,818 and $651,989, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from continuing operations were $0 and $614,291, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from discontinued operations were $552,611 and $0 respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, bad debts from discontinued operations were $552,611 and $0, respectively.

Revenue Recognition  

Our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  Sales revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of ours exist and collectability is reasonably assured. No revenue is recognized if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return of the goods. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.

Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added taxes, or VAT. All of our products sold in China are subject to VAT of 17% of the gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by us on raw materials and other materials purchased in China and included in the cost of producing the finished product. We record VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the consolidated financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables. Sales and purchases are recorded net of VAT collected and paid when we act as an agent for the PRC government.

Our sales policy allows for the return of product within the warranty period if the product is defective and the defects are our fault.  As alternatives for the product return option, the customers have options of asking a discount from us for the products with quality issues or receiving replacement parts from us at no cost. The amount for return of products, the discount provided to the customers and cost for the replacement parts were immaterial for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in USD. The functional currency of Nova LifeStyle, Nova Samoa, Nova Furniture BVI, Nova Macao, Bright Swallow, and Diamond Bar is the United States Dollar ( $  or  USD ). The functional currency of our PRC subsidiaries, Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum and Ding Nuo, is RMB. The functional currencies of our foreign operations are translated into USD for balance sheet accounts using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, except for equity account using the historical exchange rate, and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, captioned  Accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in  Other income (expenses)  in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. There have been no significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date.

Segment Reporting

ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting,  requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.

We determined that our operations constitute a single reportable segment in accordance with ASC 280. We operate exclusively in one business and industry segment: the design, manufacture and sale of furniture. All of our long-lived assets for production are located at our facilities in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China, and operate within the same environmental, safety and quality regulations governing furniture manufacturers. We established Nova Macao and Ding Nuo, and acquired Diamond Bar and Bright Swallow for the purpose of marketing and selling our products. As a result, we view the business and operations of Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, Diamond Bar, Bright Swallow and Ding Nuo as a blended gross margin when determining future growth, return on investment and cash flows. Nova Museum, a non-profit organization engaged principally in the promotion and dissemination of the culture and history of furniture in China, has no operations or substantial assets other than its decorations and renovation, and its heritage and cultural assets are for the purpose of exhibition only.

Accordingly, we concluded that we had one reportable segment under ASC 280 because: (i) our products sold through Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, and Ding Nuo are created with similar production processes, in the same facilities, under the same regulatory environment and sold to customers using similar distribution systems; (ii) Diamond Bar is a furniture distributor based in California focusing on customers in the US, and Bright Swallow is a furniture distributor based in Hong Kong focusing on customers in Canada, both of which are operated under the same senior management of Nova Dongguan and Nova Macao, and we   view the operations of Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao, Diamond Bar, Bright Swallow and Ding Nuo as a whole for making business decisions; and (iii) although Nova Museum is principally engaged in the dissemination of the culture and history of furniture in China, it also serves a function of promoting and marketing our image and products by providing a platform and channel for consumers to be exposed to us and our products, it is operated under the same management with the same resources and in the same location as Nova Dongguan, and it is an additive and supplemental unit to our main operations, the manufacture and sale of furniture.

New Accounting Pronouncements    

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the reporting entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If the entity is in such a position, the standard provides for certain disclosures depending on whether or not the entity will be able to successfully mitigate its going concern status. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. We are evaluating the effect that these ASUs will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17 Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control. This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

Net Sales 

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $30.54 million, an increase of 27% from $24.06 million in the same period of 2015; this increase in net sales resulted primarily from a 55% increase in average selling price, which was partially offset by a 19% decrease in sales volume. Our largest selling product categories in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were sofas, beds and dining tables, which accounted for approximately 57%, 15% and 6% of sales, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016; and 28%, 12% and 16% of sales, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Table of Contents 

The $6.47 million increase in net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, was attributable to increased sales in Asia, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. North American sales increased 4% to $22.53 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $21.58 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to aggressive changes to our product mix and our sales and marketing strategies aimed at diversifying sales. We sold high quality products while offering discounts during our promotion period, which lasted throughout the second quarter of 2016. Due to the increased sales volume of higher quality products relative to our other products, we generally sold our products at higher prices and in lower volumes. We continued to increase marketing efforts in the U.S. markets while maintaining our marketing efforts and existing customer base in Europe. Sales to Europe were $2.93 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 114.2% from $1.37 million in the same period of 2015, primarily as a result of the improving European economy, which led to an increase in the volume of sales orders we received. We anticipate increasing sales and marketing to the European market as the region s economic outlook improves. Hong Kong sales increased to $1.70 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.20 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales orders from one customer who was engaged in a project in the United Kingdom. Sales to Australia increased to $1.36 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.16 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to an increase in sales order volume from new customers in that region. Sales to Asia, excluding Hong Kong, increased 132% to $1.75 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.75 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to increases of sales orders of our products from one customer in the Middle East. 

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales consists primarily of finished goods purchased from other manufacturers, material costs, labor costs and related overhead directly attributable to the production of our products. Total cost of sales increased 26% to $25.94 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.56 million in the same period of 2015, due to an increase in purchases of products from third party manufacturers. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit increased 31% to $4.60 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.51 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in sales and decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Our gross profit margin increased slightly to 15.07% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 14.57% in the same period of 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, we sold a larger amount of high quality, and higher priced products.. As a result, our gross profit margin slightly increased as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Operating expenses were $3.54 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.96 million in the same period of 2015. Selling expenses increased 78% to $2.05 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.15 million in the same period of 2015, due primarily to increased marketing, shipping and handling costs. General and administrative expense decreased 18% to $1.49 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.81 million in the same period of 2015, primarily caused by a decrease in bad debts of $618,000, This was notwithstanding an increase in stock-based compensation by approximately $127,000.    

Other Expenses, Net 

Other expenses, net was $116,926 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with other expense, net, of $90,681 in the same period of 2015, representing an increase in other expense of $0.03 million. The increase in other expense was due primarily to increased interest expense of $26,959 to $96,535 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $69,576 as expense in the same period of 2015 and financial expense of $20,273 from $33,733 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $13,460 in the same period of 2015.

Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 

Income tax benefit was $100,656 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with tax expense of $48,233 in the same period of 2015.  The income tax benefit was mainly related to the reversal of our prior year ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) reserves due the statute of limitations expiration.

Loss from Discontinued Operations 

The subsidiaries that we sold on October 25, 2016, Nova Furniture BVI, Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum, and Ding Nuo, are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased approximately $0.37 million, or 99%, from a loss of approximately $0.37 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 to a loss of approximately $0.74 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The increase in loss was primarily attributable to a loss of approximately $0.10 million on disposal of fixed assets and bad debt expense of approximately $0.55 million incurred by Nova Dongguan in the three month period ended September 30, 2016..

Net Income   

Net income was $0.30 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 891% from $0.03 million of net income for the same period of 2015. This increase was mainly due to an increased net sales by 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily as a result of increased sales volume of higher quality, higher priced products.  Our net income margin from continuing operations was 3.42% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with 1.75% for the same period of 2015 after excluding the loss on change in fair value and extinguishment of warrant liability in the amount of $17,644.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

Net Sales 

Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $72.75 million, an increase of 9% from $66.73 million in the same period of 2015; this increase in net sales resulted primarily from a 42% increase in average selling price, which was partially offset by a 24% decrease in sales volume.   Our largest selling product categories in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were sofas, beds and dining tables, which accounted for approximately 59%, 9% and 8% of sales, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016; and 36%, 13% and 15% of sales, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The $6.02 million increase in net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, was mainly due to increased sales to Australia, Europe and Hong Kong.  North American sales decreased 8% to $52.54 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $56.99 million in the same period of 2015, as we aggressively changed our product mix and our sales and marketing strategies aimed at diversifying sales. We sold high quality products while offering discounts during our promotion period, which lasted throughout the second and third quarter of 2016. We continued to increase marketing efforts in the U.S. markets while maintaining our marketing efforts and existing customer base in Europe. Sales to Europe were $10.74 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 55% from $6.92 million in the same period of 2015, primarily as a result of the improving European economy.

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales consists primarily of finished goods purchased from other manufacturers. Total cost of sales increased 13% to $62.09 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $55.18 million in the same period of 2015, due primarily to increase in purchases of products from third party manufacturers. The increase of products purchased from third party manufacturers is primarily due to changes to our product mix. In 2016 to date, we have sold high quality products, which were purchased from outside manufacturers at relatively higher prices. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to 85% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 83% in the same period of 2015. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period during 2015 resulted primarily from increased cost of high quality products purchased from third party manufacturers. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit decreased 7.7% to $10.66 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.55 million in the same period of 2015.

Our gross profit margin decreased to 15% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 17% in the same period of 2015. The decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, which was due primarily to an increased cost of high quality products purchased from third parties.  In addition, in the ninth months ended September 30, 2016, we offered more competitive prices to our customers in order to attract more sales orders.

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Operating expenses were $9.11 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.52 million in the same period of 2015. Selling expenses increased 61% to $4.36 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.71 million in the same period of 2015, due primarily to increased sales and marketing expense. General and administrative expense slightly decreased 1% to $4.76 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $4.81 million in the same period of 2015. 

Other Expenses, Net 

Other expenses, net was $293,884 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with other expense, net, of $980,872 in the same period of 2015, representing a decrease in other expense of $0.69 million. The decrease in other expense was due primarily to a change in fair value and extinguishment of warrant liability which was decreased to $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $767,096 as expense in the same period of 2015, following the termination and surrender of the outstanding warrants in May 2015.

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $60,063 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $111,936 of income tax expense in the same period of 2015.   The income tax benefit was mainly due to accruing interest on prior year ASC 740-10 (FIN 48) reserves , offset by the reversal of our tax liability reserves due to a statute of limitations expiration.

Loss from discontinued operations  

The subsidiaries that were sold on October 25, 2016, Nova Furniture BVI Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum, and Ding Nuo, are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased approximately $0.05 million, or 3.61%, from a loss of approximately $1.43 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to a loss of approximately $1.48 million for the nine month period ended September 2016.

Net (Loss) Income 

As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $0.29 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $1.52 million of net income for the same period of 2015. This increase in net loss was mainly due to an increased cost of sales by 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. Our net profit margin from continuing operations was 1.63% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with 5.56% of net profit margin for the same period of 2015 after excluding the loss on change in fair value and extinguishment of warrant liability of $767,096.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal demands for liquidity are from our efforts to increase sales in the U.S. and China, to purchase inventory, and for expenditures related to sales distribution and general corporate purposes. We intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and production capacity, purchase of raw materials and the expansion of our business, primarily through cash flow provided by operations and collections of accounts receivable, and credit facilities from banks.

As we continue to execute our growth strategy focused on aggressively expanding sales, particularly in the U.S., we remain focused on improving net margins and bottom line growth.  As noted above, while a particular focus in this regard is on reducing reliance on lower margin third party manufacturing and expansion of our own higher margin production facilities, we have in recent periods found it necessary to increase reliance on third party providers in order to meet demand for particular products required by certain of our customers. We also believe there is elasticity in pricing our higher end products and an ongoing opportunity to improve our product mix which should help us to stay in step with cost increases.  

We rely primarily on internally generated cash flow and proceeds under our existing credit facilities to support growth.  We may seek additional financing in the form of bank loans or other credit facilities or funds raised through future offerings of our equity or debt, if and when we determine such offerings are required. On April 14, 2014, we raised approximately $8.12 million after deducting fees to the placement agent of $716,000 and other estimated offering expenses of $115,000 by entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers in a registered direct offering. On May 28, 2015, we raised approximately $3.65 million after deducting fees to the placement agent of $335,000 and other offering expenses paid of $20,000 by entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers in a registered direct offering.

We had net working capital of $56,547,911 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $7.92 million from net working capital of $48,627,874 at December 31, 2015. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.73-to-1 at September 30, 2016.

The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net cash used in operating activities was $1.47 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of cash outflow of $2.75 million from $4.22 million of cash used in operating activities in the same period of 2015. The decrease in cash outflow was attributable primarily to an increased cash inflow of $0.13 million for making less payments for accounts payable, compared with $0.54 million outflow in the same period of 2015, and an increased cash inflow for advance from customers was $0.58 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.06 million outflow in the same period of 2015. Our cash inflow for inventories was $0.24 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.12 million outflow in the same period of 2015. Also, we had a decreased cash outflow of $0.56 million from accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the $8.43 million cash outflow from accounts receivable, mainly due to the improved timely collection on accounts receivable.  That amount was offset by increased cash outflow from advance to suppliers of $3.61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with cash inflow of $1.90 million in the same period of 2015 due to prepayment for inventory purchase in order to receive discount from the vendors, and cash outflow from other current assets of $0.71 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with cash outflow of $0.56 million in the same period of 2015.  Net operating cash flows from discontinued operations decreased from an inflow of $0.26 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to an outflow of $0.17 million in the same period of 2016.

Net investing cash outflow from discontinued operations decreased from $1.33 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to an outflow of $0.22 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to lesser amount was spent on acquisition of land use rights, property and equipment and new factory construction in Dongguan in 2016.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Not required.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date as identified in our internal control over financial reporting below.

Notwithstanding this material weakness, our management has concluded that, based upon the interim remediation of internal control described below under  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting , our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this report are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based upon the updated framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in 1992 and updated in May 2013. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we currently lack sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.

42 

Table of Contents 

We have taken, and are taking, certain actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We plan to hire additional credentialed professional staff and consulting professionals with greater knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP and related regulatory requirements to oversee our financial reporting process in order to ensure our compliance with U.S. GAAP and other relevant securities laws. For example, we have interviewed several candidates for a Vice President of Finance position and we are still in the process of searching for an acceptable candidate. In addition, we provided additional training to our accounting personnel on U.S. GAAP, and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements in 2015. Until such time as we hire qualified accounting personnel with the requisite U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and train our current accounting personnel, we have engaged an outside CPA with U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to supplement our current internal accounting personnel and assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition to the above stated remediation plan we previously engaged an outside Sarbanes-Oxley Act consultant in March 2012 to assist us with improving the design and operations of our internal controls over financial reporting for our U.S. parent company and all subsidiaries.

We believe the measures described above will remediate the material weakness identified above. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures are necessary to address control any future deficiencies.

Other than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

We may occasionally become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
