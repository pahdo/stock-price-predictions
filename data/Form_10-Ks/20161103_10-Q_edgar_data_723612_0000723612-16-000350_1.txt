FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be considered  forward-looking statements  as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our future financial performance, business strategy, projected plans and objectives. These statements may be identified by the fact that they do not relate to historical or current facts and may use words such as  believes,   expects,   anticipates,   will,   should,   could,   may,   would,   intends,   projects,   estimates,   plans,  and similar words, expressions or phrases. The following important factors and assumptions could affect our future results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements: 

the high level of competition in the vehicle rental industry and the impact such competition may have on pricing and rental volume; 

a change in travel demand, including changes in airline passenger traffic; 

a change in our fleet costs as a result of a change in the cost of new vehicles, manufacturer recalls, disruption in the supply of new vehicles, and/or a change in the price at which we dispose of used vehicles either in the used vehicle market or under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs; 

the results of operations or financial condition of the manufacturers of our cars, which could impact their ability to perform their payment obligations under our agreements with them, including repurchase and/or guaranteed depreciation arrangements, and/or their willingness or ability to make cars available to us or the rental car industry as a whole on commercially reasonable terms or at all; 

any change in economic conditions generally, particularly during our peak season or in key market segments; 

our ability to continue to achieve and maintain cost savings and successfully implement our business strategies; 

our ability to obtain financing for our global operations, including the funding of our vehicle fleet through the issuance of asset-backed securities and use of the global lending markets; 

an occurrence or threat of terrorism, pandemic disease, natural disasters, military conflict or civil unrest in the locations in which we operate; 

our dependence on third-party distribution channels, third-party suppliers of other services and co-marketing arrangements with third parties; 

our ability to utilize derivative instruments, and the impact of derivative instruments we utilize, which can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, gasoline prices and exchange rates, changes in government regulations and other factors; 

our ability to accurately estimate our future results; 

any major disruptions in our communication networks or information systems; 

our exposure to uninsured or unpaid claims in excess of historical levels; 

risks associated with litigation, governmental or regulatory inquiries, or any failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations or contractual obligations or any changes in laws, regulations or contractual obligations, including with respect to personally identifiable information and taxes; 

any impact on us from the actions of our licensees, dealers and independent contractors; 
     
   1 

     Table of Contents  

any substantial changes in the cost or supply of fuel, vehicle parts, energy, labor or other resources on which we depend to operate our business; 

risks related to our indebtedness, including our substantial outstanding debt obligations and our ability to incur substantially more debt; 

our ability to meet the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness; 

risks related to tax obligations and the effect of future changes in accounting standards; 

risks related to completed or future acquisitions or investments that we may pursue, including any incurrence of incremental indebtedness to help fund such transactions and our ability to promptly and effectively integrate any acquired businesses; 

risks related to protecting the integrity of our information technology systems and the confidential information of our employees and customers against security breaches, including cyber-security breaches; and 

other business, economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, political or technological factors affecting our operations, pricing or services, including uncertainty and instability in Europe related to the potential withdrawal of countries from the European Union. 
       
  We operate in a continuously changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. New risk factors, factors beyond our control, or changes in the impact of identified risk factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. Other factors and assumptions not identified above, including those discussed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ,  Risk Factors  and other portions of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2016 (the  2015 Form 10-K ), could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  
    
  Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. Except to the extent of our obligations under the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
  (Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in tables are in millions, except per share amounts) 

1. 
    Basis of Presentation  
       
  Avis Budget Group, Inc. provides car and truck rentals, car sharing services and ancillary services to businesses and consumers worldwide. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements include the accounts and transactions of Avis Budget Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as entities in which Avis Budget Group, Inc. directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest (collectively, the  Company ), and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting. 
  The Company operates the following reportable business segments: 

Americas   provides and licenses the Company s brands to third parties for vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and operates the Company s car sharing business in certain of these markets. 

International   provides and licenses the Company s brands to third parties for vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and operates the Company s car sharing business in certain of these markets. 
       
  The operating results of acquired businesses are included in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements from the dates of acquisition. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company completed the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of its Avis and Budget licensees in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, its Avis and Budget licensee in Brazil and Maggiore Group. There were no material adjustments to the preliminary allocation. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Company s fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of its Avis licensee in Poland has not yet been finalized; however, there have been no significant changes to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In presenting the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management s opinion, the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results reported. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2015 Form  10-K. 
    
  Vehicle Programs.   The Company presents separately the financial data of its vehicle programs. These programs are distinct from the Company s other activities since the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of the Company s vehicle programs. The Company believes it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of its vehicle programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets. 
    
  Transaction-related costs, net.   Transaction-related costs, net are classified separately in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income. These costs are comprised of expenses related to acquisition-related activities such as due-diligence and other advisory costs, expenses related to the integration of the acquiree s operations with those of the Company, including the implementation of best practices and process improvements, non-cash gains and losses related to re-acquired rights, expenses related to pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

Currency Transactions.   The Company records the gain or loss on foreign-currency transactions on certain intercompany loans and the gain or loss on intercompany loan hedges within interest expense related to corporate debt, net. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded losses on such items of   $1 million   in each period, and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded losses of   $8 million   and   $10 million  , respectively. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
    
  On January 1, 2016, as a result of the issuance of a new accounting pronouncement, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination at the acquisition date. Instead, the cumulative impact of any adjustment will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, as a result of the issuance of a new accounting pronouncement, the Company adopted ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,  which provides guidance for determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software, rather than as a service contract. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, as a result of the issuance of a new accounting pronouncement, the Company adopted ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flow. ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, minimum statutory withholding requirements and classification in the statement of cash flow. ASU 2016-09 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this accounting pronouncement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires a lessee to recognize all long-term leases on its balance sheet as a liability for its lease obligation, measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and a corresponding asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this accounting pronouncement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which makes limited amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The new standard amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Table of Contents  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which outlines a single model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this accounting pronouncement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2.  
    Restructuring 
       
  In 2014, the Company committed to various strategic initiatives to identify best practices and drive efficiency throughout its organization, by reducing headcount, improving processes and consolidating functions (the  T15 restructuring ). In first quarter 2016, the Company expanded the T15 restructuring to take advantage of additional efficiency opportunities. The expanded T15 restructuring fits within the initiative s focus areas to identify best practices and drive efficiency throughout the organization, including the consolidation of rental locations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as part of this process, the Company formally communicated the termination of employment to approximately   565   employees, and as of September 30, 2016, the Company had terminated approximately   425   of these employees. The costs associated with this initiative primarily represent severance, outplacement services and other costs associated with employee terminations, the majority of which have been or are expected to be settled in cash. The Company expects further restructuring expense of approximately   $2 million   related to this initiative to be incurred in 2016. 
    
  In conjunction with previous acquisitions, the Company identified opportunities to integrate and streamline its operations, primarily in Europe (the  Acquisition integration ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as part of this process, the Company formally communicated the termination of employment to approximately   125   employees, and as of September 30, 2016, the Company had terminated approximately   110   of these employees. The Company expects further restructuring expense of approximately   $2 million   related to this initiative to be incurred in 2016. 
    
  The following tables summarize the activity related to our restructuring liabilities: 

_________ 
            (a)

    Earnings Per Share 
       
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) (shares in millions):  

__________ 
            (a)   
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   0.2 million   and   0.3 million   non-vested stock awards, respectively, have an anti-dilutive effect and therefore are excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   0.2 million   and   0.1 million  , respectively, non-vested stock awards have an anti-dilutive effect and therefore are excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

    Other Current Assets 
       
  Other current assets consisted of:

    Intangible Assets 
       
  Intangible assets consisted of: 

__________ 
            (a)   
    The increase in the carrying amount since December 31, 2015 primarily reflects currency translation. 
       
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was approximately   $15 million   and   $16 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was approximately   $48 million   and   $43 million  , respectively. Based on the Company s amortizable intangible assets at   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects amortization expense of approximately   $16 million   for

At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had payables related to vehicle purchases included in liabilities under vehicle programs - other of   $164 million   and   $183 million  , respectively, and receivables related to vehicle sales included in assets under vehicle programs - receivables from vehicle manufacturers and other of   $586 million   and   $635 million  , respectively. 

7.  
    Income Taxes 
       
  The Company s effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is a provision of   39.8%  . Such rate differed from the Federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to state and foreign income taxes. 
    
  The Company s effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was a provision of   15.9%  . Such rate differed from the Federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to a   $98 million   income tax benefit related to resolution of a prior-year tax matter.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Contingencies 
    
  In 2006, the Company completed the spin-offs of its Realogy and Wyndham subsidiaries. The Company does not believe that the impact of any resolution of pre-existing contingent liabilities in connection with the spin-offs should result in a material liability to the Company in relation to its consolidated financial position or liquidity, as Realogy and Wyndham each have agreed to assume responsibility for these liabilities. The Company is also named in litigation that is primarily related to the businesses of its former subsidiaries, including Realogy and Wyndham. The Company is entitled to indemnification from such entities for any liability resulting from such litigation.

In February 2015, the French Competition Authority issued a statement of objections alleging that several car rental companies, including the Company and two of its European subsidiaries, engaged with (i) twelve French airports, the majority of which are controlled by public administrative bodies or the French state, and violated competition law through the distribution by airports of company-specific statistics to car rental companies operating at those airports and (ii) two other international car rental companies in a concerted practice relating to train station surcharges. In May 2016, the French Competition authority issued a second statement of objections reiterating the allegations that it raised in its first statement of objections. The Company believes that it has valid defenses and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations, but it is currently unable to predict the outcome of the proceedings or range of reasonably possible losses, which may be material. 
    
  In March 2015, the Canadian Competition Bureau filed an application with the Competition Tribunal alleging that the Company and two of its Canadian subsidiaries engaged in deceptive marketing practices with regard to certain charges that consumers are invoiced related to renting a vehicle and associated products in Canada. The application sought penalties against the Company and its subsidiaries totaling approximately   $25 million   as well as reimbursements to current and former customers of amounts collected and retained by the Company related to the alleged deceptive marketing practices. In June 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries reached an agreement to settle this application for an immaterial amount and to adopt a competition law compliance program. 
    
  The Company is involved in claims, legal proceedings and governmental inquiries related, among other things, to its vehicle rental operations, including contract and licensee disputes, competition matters, employment matters, insurance claims, intellectual property claims, business practice disputes and other regulatory, environmental, commercial and tax matters. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and, although the Company believes that its accruals are adequate and/or that it has valid defenses in these matters, unfavorable resolutions could occur. Excluding the French competition matter discussed above, the Company estimates that the potential exposure resulting from adverse outcomes of legal proceedings in which it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred could, in the aggregate, be up to approximately   $30 million   in excess of amounts accrued as of   September 30, 2016  ; however, the Company does not believe that the impact should result in a material liability to the Company in relation to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Commitments to Purchase Vehicles 
    
  The Company maintains agreements with vehicle manufacturers under which the Company has agreed to purchase approximately   $7.3 billion   of vehicles from manufacturers over the next 12 months. The majority of these commitments are subject to the vehicle manufacturers  satisfying their obligations under their respective repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements. The purchase of such vehicles is financed primarily through the issuance of vehicle-backed debt and cash received upon the disposition of vehicles. 
    
  Concentrations 
    
  Concentrations of credit risk at   September 30, 2016   include (i) risks related to the Company s repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements with domestic and foreign car manufacturers, including   Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Toyota, Mercedes, Renault, Hyundai and BMW  , and primarily with respect to receivables for program cars that have been disposed but for which the Company has not yet received payment from the manufacturers and (ii) risks related to Realogy and Wyndham, including receivables of   $40 million   and   $25 million  , respectively, related to certain contingent, income tax and other corporate liabilities assumed by Realogy and Wyndham in connection with their disposition.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:  

__________ 
  All components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are net of tax, except currency translation adjustments, which exclude income taxes related to indefinite investments in foreign subsidiaries and include a   $58 million   gain, net of tax, as of   September 30, 2016   related to the Company s hedge of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations (see Note 13 - Financial Instruments). 
            (a)   
    For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into corporate interest expense were   $2 million   (  $1 million  , net of tax) and   $6 million   (  $3 million  , net of tax), respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into vehicle interest expense were   $1 million   (  $0 million  , net of tax) in each period. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into corporate interest expense were   $2 million   (  $1 million  , net of tax) and   $5 million   (  $3 million  , net of tax), respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into vehicle interest expense were immaterial and during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into vehicle interest expense were   $1 million   (  $1 million  , net of tax). 
               (b)   
    For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into operating expenses were $1 million ($1 million, net of tax) in each period. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into operating expenses were immaterial.  
               (c)   
    For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into selling, general and administrative expenses were   $1 million   (  $1 million  ), net of tax) and   $4 million   (  $3 million  ), net of tax), respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into selling, general and administrative expenses were   $3 million   (  $2 million  , net of tax) and   $5 million   (  $3 million  , net of tax), respectively.

    Financial Instruments 
       
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Currency Risk.   The Company uses currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to changes in currency exchange rates associated with its non-U.S.-dollar denominated receivables and forecasted royalties, forecasted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and forecasted non-U.S.-dollar denominated acquisitions. The Company primarily hedges a portion of its current-year currency exposure to the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars, the Euro and the British pound sterling. The majority of forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts do, however, largely offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk they economically hedge. Forward contracts used to hedge forecasted third-party receipts and disbursements up to 12 months are designated and do qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company has designated its Euro-denominated notes as a hedge of its investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations.  
  The amount of gains or losses reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings resulting from ineffectiveness or from excluding a component of the hedges  gain or loss from the effectiveness calculation for cash flow and net investment hedges during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was not material, nor is the amount of gains or losses the Company expects to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings over the next 12 months. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk.   The Company uses various hedging strategies including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to create an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities. The Company uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage the risk related to its floating rate corporate debt and its floating rate vehicle-backed debt. The Company records the effective portion of changes in the fair value of its cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. The Company records the gains or losses related to freestanding derivatives, which are not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes, in its consolidated results of operations. The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. The amount of gains or losses reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings resulting from ineffectiveness related to the Company s cash flow hedges was not material during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company estimates that   $6 million   of losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. 
    
  The Company enters into derivative commodity contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the price of unleaded gasoline. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded within operating expenses. 
    
  The Company held derivative instruments with absolute notional values as follows:  

__________ 
            (a)   
    Represents   $7.6 billion   of interest rate caps sold, partially offset by approximately   $2.6 billion   of interest rate caps purchased.

    Segment Information 
       
  The Company s chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources based upon the separate financial information from the Company s operating segments. In identifying its reportable segments, the Company considered the nature of services provided, the geographical areas in which the segments operated and other relevant factors. The Company aggregates certain of its operating segments into its reportable segments. 
    
  Management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon revenue and  Adjusted EBITDA,  which the Company defines as income from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization, any impairment charge, restructuring expense, early extinguishment of debt costs, non-vehicle related interest, transaction-related costs and income taxes. The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

               OVERVIEW 

Our Company  
    
  We operate three of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental and car sharing industry, Avis, Budget and Zipcar. We are a leading vehicle rental operator in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and certain other regions we serve, with an average rental fleet of more than 580,000 vehicles. We also license the use of our trademarks to licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly. We and our licensees operate our brands in approximately 180 countries throughout the world.  
    
  Our Segments 
    
  We categorize our operations into two reportable business segments:   Americas  , consisting primarily of our vehicle rental operations in North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and our car sharing operations in certain of these markets; and   International  , consisting primarily of our vehicle rental operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and our car sharing operations in certain of these markets. 
    
  Business and Trends 
    
  Our revenues are derived principally from vehicle rentals in our Company-owned operations and include: 
             
    time and mileage ( T M ) fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals; 
                
    payments from our customers with respect to certain operating expenses we incur, including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees, as well as concession fees, which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations;  
                
    sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals; and 
                
    royalty revenue from our licensees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions. 
       
  Our operating results are subject to variability due to seasonality, macroeconomic conditions and other factors. Car rental volumes tend to be associated with the travel industry, particularly airline passenger volumes, or enplanements, which in turn tend to reflect general economic conditions. Our vehicle rental operations are also seasonal, with the third quarter of the year historically having been our strongest due to the increased level of leisure travel during such quarter. We have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size, and therefore the cost, of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand. 
    
  We believe that the following factors, among others, may affect our financial condition and results of operations: 

general travel demand, including worldwide enplanements; 

fleet, pricing, marketing and strategic decisions made by us and by our competitors; 

changes in fleet costs and in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace, as well as manufacturer recalls;  

changes in borrowing costs and in market willingness to purchase corporate and vehicle-related debt;

     Table of Contents  

demand for truck rentals and car sharing services; 

changes in the price of gasoline; and 

changes in currency exchange rates. 
     Throughout 2016, we have operated in an uncertain and uneven economic environment marked by heightened geopolitical risks. Nonetheless, we continue to anticipate that worldwide demand for vehicle rental and car sharing services will increase in 2016, most likely against a backdrop of modest and uneven global economic growth. Our access to new fleet vehicles has been adequate to meet our needs for both replacement of existing vehicles in the normal course and for growth to meet incremental demand, and we expect that to continue to be the case. We will look to pursue opportunities for pricing increases in the remaining months of 2016 and in 2017 in order to enhance our returns on invested capital and profitability. 
    
  Our objective is to focus on strategically accelerating our growth, strengthening our global position as a leading provider of vehicle rental services, continuing to enhance our customers  rental experience, and controlling costs and driving efficiency throughout the organization. We operate in a highly competitive industry and we expect to continue to face challenges and risks. We seek to mitigate our exposure to risks in numerous ways, including delivering upon our core strategic initiatives and through continued optimization of fleet levels to match changes in demand for vehicle rentals, maintenance of liquidity to fund our fleet and our operations, appropriate investments in technology and adjustments in the size, nature and terms of our relationships with vehicle manufacturers. 
    
  During   2016  : 

Our net revenues totaled   $6.8 billion   in the first nine months of the year and grew 3% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net income was   $194 million  , representing a   $124 million   year-over-year decline in earnings, and our Adjusted EBITDA was   $717 million  , representing a $58 million year-over-year decline, due to lower pricing, higher per-unit fleet costs and a $28 million (4%) negative impact from currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased rental volume. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately   $290 million   of our common stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately   9.5 million   shares, or 10%. 

We issued  300 million of 4     % Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2024, the proceeds of which have been used in October primarily to redeem  275 million of our outstanding 6% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2021. 

We extended the maturity date for   $825 million   of our existing   $970 million   of corporate term loan borrowings by three years, to March 2022. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net income was   $209 million  , representing a   $25 million   year-over-year increase in earnings, and our Adjusted EBITDA was   $469 million  , representing a $38 million year-over-year increase and the highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA in our history as a stand-alone vehicle rental services company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  We measure performance principally using the following key operating statistics: (i) rental days, which represents the total number of days (or portion thereof) a vehicle was rented, and (ii) T M revenue per rental day, which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers, both of which exclude our U.S. truck rental and Zipcar car sharing operations. We also measure our ancillary revenues (rental-transaction revenue other than T M revenue), such as from the sale of collision and loss damage waivers, insurance products, fuel service options and portable GPS navigation unit rentals. Our vehicle rental operating statistics (rental days and T M revenue per rental day) are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a 24-hour period. We believe that this methodology provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business. Our calculation may not be comparable to other companies  calculation of similarly-titled statistics. In addition, per-unit fleet costs exclude our U.S. truck rental operations. We present currency exchange rate impacts to provide a method of assessing how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rate impacts are calculated by translating the current-year results at the prior-period average exchange rate plus any related gains and losses on currency hedges. 
    
  We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the separate financial information of our operating segments. In identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments, the geographical areas in which our segments operate and other relevant factors. Management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and  Adjusted EBITDA,  which we define as income from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization, any impairment charges, restructuring expense, early extinguishment of debt costs, non-vehicle related interest, transaction-related costs and income taxes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the aggregate performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows investors to assess our financial condition and results of operations on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  We present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs. These programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs. We believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets. 
    
  FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs increased primarily due to a temporary increase in cash from the issuance of 4     % Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2024 and a seasonal increase in value-added tax receivables, which are recoverable from government agencies. Total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs increased primarily due to a temporary increase in corporate debt and a seasonal increase in accounts payable (See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  regarding the changes in our corporate financings). 
    
  The increases in assets under vehicle programs and liabilities under vehicle programs are principally related to the seasonal increase in the size of our vehicle rental fleet. The increase in stockholders  equity is primarily due to our net income and currency translation adjustments, largely offset by repurchases of our common stock.

     Table of Contents  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities, as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities, each of which is discussed below. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   $350 million   of 6 % Senior Notes due 2024 at par. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to redeem   $300 million   principal amount of our 4 % Senior Notes due 2017 during second quarter 2016 and for general corporate purposes. We also issued  300 million of 4     % Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2024, the proceeds of which have been used in October 2016 primarily to redeem a portion of our outstanding 6% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2021. In addition, we repurchased approximately   9.5 million   shares of our outstanding common stock for approximately   $290 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  CASH FLOWS 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows: 

Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased 3% compared with the same period in   2015  . 
    
  The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in   2015   is primarily due to a net increase in proceeds received from the sale and purchase of vehicles and reduced business acquisition activity. 
    
  The decrease in cash provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in   2015   is primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings under vehicle programs, partially offset by a temporary increase in net corporate borrowings. 

DEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $14 billion   of indebtedness, including corporate indebtedness of approximately   $4 billion   and debt under vehicle programs of approximately   $10 billion  .

The Company has entered into a swap to hedge $600 million of its interest rate exposure related to the floating rate term loan at an aggregate rate of 4.21%.    
               (e)   
    Primarily includes capital leases which are secured by liens on the related assets.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the committed corporate credit facilities available to us and/or our subsidiaries included:  

__________ 
            (a)   
    The senior revolving credit facility bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points and is part of the Company s senior credit facility, which is secured by pledges of capital stock of certain subsidiaries of the Company, and liens on substantially all of the Company s intellectual property and certain other real and personal property. 
               (b)   
    These facilities encompass bank overdraft lines of credit, bearing interest of 1.50% to 3.00%.    
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had various uncommitted credit facilities available, under which we had drawn approximately   $4 million  , which bear interest at rates between   0.85%   and   4.00%  . 
  The following table presents available funding under our debt arrangements related to our vehicle programs at   September 30, 2016  : 

__________ 
            (a)   
    Capacity is subject to maintaining sufficient assets to collateralize debt. 
               (b)   
    The outstanding debt is collateralized by approximately $8.7 billion of underlying vehicles and related assets.       
               (c)   
    The outstanding debt is collateralized by approximately $1.1 billion of underlying vehicles and related assets. 
               (d)   
    The outstanding debt is collateralized by approximately $2.4 billion of underlying vehicles and related assets.       
               (e)   
    The outstanding debt is collateralized by approximately $0.2 billion of underlying vehicles and related assets.       

LIQUIDITY RISK 
    
  Our primary liquidity needs include the payment of operating expenses, servicing of corporate and vehicle related debt and procurement of rental vehicles to be used in our operations. The present intention of management is to reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely into our foreign operations. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate foreign earnings to the United States to service corporate debt or for other U.S. needs. Our primary sources of funding are operating revenue, cash received upon the sale of vehicles, borrowings under our vehicle-backed borrowing arrangements and our senior revolving credit facility, and other financing activities. 
    
  As discussed above, as of   September 30, 2016  , we have cash and cash equivalents of   $985 million  , available borrowing capacity under our committed credit facilities of approximately   $0.9 billion   and available capacity under our vehicle programs of approximately   $3.2 billion  . 
    
  Our liquidity position could be negatively affected by financial market disruptions or a downturn in the U.S. and worldwide economies, which may result in unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry, in the asset-backed financing market, and in the credit markets generally. We believe these factors have in the past affected and could in the future affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings. Additionally, a downturn in the worldwide economy or a disruption in the credit markets could impact our liquidity due to (i) decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used-vehicle market, (ii) increased costs associated with, and/or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under, our financings, (iii) the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers, including   Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Toyota, Mercedes, Renault, Hyundai and BMW  , being unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles and (iv) disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market. 
    
  Our liquidity position could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial and other covenants associated with our senior credit facility and other borrowings, including a maximum

     Table of Contents  

leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our indebtedness. For additional information regarding our liquidity risks, see Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of our   2015   Form 10-K. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  Our future contractual obligations have not changed significantly from the amounts reported within our   2015   Form 10-K. Changes to our obligations related to corporate indebtedness and debt under vehicle programs are presented above within the section titled  Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Financing Arrangements  and also within Notes 8 and 9 to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex. However, in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make pertain to matters that are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events. Presented within the section titled  Critical Accounting Policies  of our   2015   Form 10-K are the accounting policies (related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, vehicles, income taxes and public liability, property damage and other insurance liabilities) that we believe require subjective and/or complex judgments that could potentially affect   2016   reported results. There have been no significant changes to those accounting policies or our assessment of which accounting policies we would consider to be critical accounting policies. 
    
  New Accounting Standards 
    
  For detailed information regarding new accounting standards and their impact on our business, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
       
  We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and gasoline prices. We assess our market risks based on changes in interest and currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We used   September 30, 2016   market rates to perform a sensitivity analysis separately for each of these market risk exposures. We have determined, through such analyses, that the impact of a 10% change in interest or currency exchange rates on our results of operations, balance sheet and cash flows would not be material. Additionally, we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline. We anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future. We determined that a 10% change in the price of unleaded gasoline would not have a material impact on our earnings for the period ended   September 30, 2016  . For additional information regarding our long-term borrowings and financial instruments, see Notes 8, 9 and 13 to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
           (a) 
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
           (b) 
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   During the fiscal quarter to which this report relates, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THIS NOTE) TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS  
  
   63 

REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE IN CUSTODY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS HEREOF OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO THE COMMON DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE IN CUSTODY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS HEREOF OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, THE COMMON DEPOSITARY, HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN. 
  TRANSFERS OF THIS GLOBAL NOTE SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF THE COMMON DEPOSITARY OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR S NOMINEE AND TRANSFERS OF PORTIONS OF THIS GLOBAL NOTE SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 2.1 AND 2.6 OF THE INDENTURE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THIS NOTE).

If a beneficial interest in a Global Note is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Registrar will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Note being transferred or exchanged equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) record a like increase in the principal amount of the other Global Note.  Any beneficial interest in one Global Note that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note, or exchanged for an interest in another Global Note, will, upon transfer or exchange, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer and exchange restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such an interest. 
  
   64 

(2)        Members of, or participants in, Euroclear or Clearstream (   Agent Members   ) shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the Depositary or its custodian, or under such Global Note, and the Depositary may be treated by the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depositary governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Note. 
  (3)        In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interest in a Global Note pursuant to   Section 2.1(f)   to beneficial owners who are required to hold Definitive Notes, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of such Global Note in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Global Note to be transferred, and the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Definitive Notes of like tenor and amount.

  (5)        The registered Holder of a Global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Notes.

  (f)        Definitive Notes  .  Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes.  Definitive Notes shall be  
  
   65 

transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Note if (A) the Common Depositary notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as the common depositary for such Global Note or the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered in order to act as depositary, and in each case a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (A) or (B) of the preceding sentence, the Issuer shall promptly make available to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent a reasonable supply of Definitive Notes.  In addition, any Note transferred to an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or evidencing a Note that has been acquired by an affiliate in a transaction or series of transactions not involving any public offering must, until one year after the last date on which either the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer was an owner of the Note, be in the form of a Definitive Note and bear the legend regarding transfer restrictions in   Section 2.1(d)  .  If required to do so pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, beneficial owners may also obtain Definitive Notes in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Note upon written request in accordance with the Depositary s and the Registrar s procedures.

  (3)        If a Definitive Note is transferred or exchanged for another Definitive Note, (x) the Registrar will cancel the Definitive Note being transferred or exchanged, (y) the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more new Definitive Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the Holder of the canceled Definitive Note (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or Holder, as applicable, and (z) if such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Definitive Note, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder thereof, one or  
  
   66 

more Definitive Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Definitive Notes, registered in the name of the Holder thereof. 
  (4)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, in no event shall a Definitive Note be delivered upon exchange or transfer of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the end of the Restricted Period.

Such Issuer Order shall specify whether the Notes will be in the form of Definitive Notes or Global Notes, the amount of the Notes to be authenticated, the date on which the original issue of Notes is to be authenticated, the holder of the Notes and whether the Notes are to be Initial Notes or Additional Notes. 
  The Trustee may appoint an agent (the    Authenticating Agent   ) reasonably acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate the Notes.  Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument signed by a Responsible Officer, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Issuer.  Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, any such Authenticating Agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so.  Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by an Authenticating Agent.  An Authenticating Agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. 
  In case any of the Issuer or any Guarantor, pursuant to   Article IV   or   Section 10.2  , as applicable, shall be consolidated or merged with or into any other Person or shall convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, and the successor Person resulting from such consolidation, or surviving such merger, or into which any of the Issuer or any Guarantor shall have been merged, or the Person which shall

have received a conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition as aforesaid, shall have executed an indenture supplemental hereto with the Trustee pursuant to   Article IV  , any of the Notes authenticated or delivered prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition may (but shall not be required), from time to time, at the request of the successor Person, be exchanged for other Notes executed in the name of the successor Person with such changes in phraseology and form as may be appropriate to reflect such successor Person, but otherwise in substance of like tenor as the Notes surrendered for such exchange and of like principal amount; and the Trustee, upon the Issuer Order of the successor Person, shall authenticate and make available for delivery Notes as specified in such order for the purpose of such exchange.  If Notes shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in any new name of a successor Person pursuant to this   Section 2.2   in exchange or substitution for or upon registration of transfer of any Notes, such successor Person, at the option of the Holders but without expense to them, shall provide for the exchange of all Notes at the time outstanding for Notes authenticated and delivered in such new name. 
  SECTION 2.3        Registrar and Paying Agent  .  The Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the    Registrar   ) and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment.  The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange (the    Notes Register   ).  The Issuer may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents.  The term  Paying Agent  includes any additional paying agent and the term  Registrar  includes any co-registrar. 
  The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture.  The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent.  The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of each such agent. The Issuer or any Guarantor may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. 
  The Issuer initially appoint Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as Paying Agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes. The Issuer may change any agent without prior notice to the Holders, but upon written notice to such agent and to the Trustee;   provided  ,   however  , that no such removal shall become effective until (i) acceptance of any appointment by a successor as evidenced by an appropriate agreement entered into by the Issuer and such successor agent, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee and the passage of any waiting or notice periods required by the Depositary s procedures or (ii) written notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as agent until the appointment of a successor in accordance with clause (i) above.  The agent may resign at any time upon written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee. 
  
   68 

The rights, powers, duties and obligations and actions of each Agent under this Indenture are several and not (i) joint or (ii) joint and several. 
  SECTION 2.4        Paying Agent To Hold Money  .  By no later than 10:00 a.m. (London time) on the date on which any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is due and payable, the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient in immediately available funds to pay such principal, premium or interest when due or at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest and Additional Interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders;   provided   that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of the Common Depositary or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the clearing systems who will then transfer such payment to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. The Issuer shall require each Paying Agent that is not a party to this Indenture and that is not an Affiliate of the Trustee to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (whether such assets have been distributed to it by the Issuer or other obligors on the Notes), shall notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Issuer or any Guarantor in making any such payment and shall during the continuance of any default by the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment in respect of the Notes, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith deliver to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Notes together with a full accounting thereof.  If the Issuer or a Subsidiary of the Issuer acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.  The Issuer at any time may require a Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds or assets disbursed by such Paying Agent.  The Paying Agent shall not be bound to make any payments unless and until it is satisfied that it has received from the Issuer such funds as are necessary to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall be entitled to make payments net of any taxes or sums required to be withheld or deducted by applicable law. Upon complying with this   Section 2.4  , the Paying Agent (if other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary of the Issuer) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee or the Holders, it being understood that the obligation to make payment lies solely with the Issuer.  Upon any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Issuer, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Notes. 
  SECTION 2.5        Holder Lists  .  The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders.  If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuer, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the Guarantors, shall furnish or cause the Registrar to furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may  
  
   69 

request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders and the Issuer. 
  SECTION 2.6        Transfer and Exchange  .

The Transfer Agent will promptly register any transfer or exchange that meets the requirements of this   Section 2.6   by noting the same in the Notes Register maintained by the Registrar for the purpose, and no transfer or exchange will be effective until it is registered in such Notes Register.  The transfer or exchange of any Note (or a beneficial interest therein) may only be made in accordance with this   Section 2.6   and   Section 2.1(e)   and   2.1(f)  , as applicable, and, in the case of a Global Note (or a beneficial interest therein), the applicable rules and procedures of the Depositary.  The Registrar shall refuse to register any requested transfer or exchange that does not comply with this paragraph.

  Address:       
  Taxpayer ID Number:       
  The undersigned represents and warrants to you that: 
  1.    We are an institutional  accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the    Securities Act   )) purchasing for our  
  
   74 

own account or for the account of such an institutional  accredited investor,  and we are acquiring the Notes not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution in violation of the Securities Act.  We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of our investment in the Notes and we invest in or purchase securities similar to the Notes in the normal course of our business.  We and any accounts for which we are acting are each able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment. 
  2.    We understand that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and, unless so registered, may not be sold except as permitted in the following sentence.  We agree on our own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which we are purchasing Notes to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date only (a) to the Issuer or any Subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (c) in a transaction complying with the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person we reasonably believe is a  qualified institutional buyer  under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (a    QIB   ) that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of a QIB and to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, (e) to an institutional  accredited investor  within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of such an institutional  accredited investor,  in each case for investment purposes and not with a view to or for offer or sale in connection with any distribution in violation of the Securities Act or (f) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of our property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within our or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws.  The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.  If any resale or other transfer of the Notes is proposed to be made pursuant to clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date, the transferor shall deliver a letter from the transferee substantially in the form of this letter to the Issuer and the Trustee and Registrar, which shall provide, among other things, that the transferee is an institutional  accredited investor  (within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) and that it is acquiring such Notes for investment purposes and not for distribution in violation of the Securities Act.  Each purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer and the Trustee and Registrar reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Notes pursuant to clauses (d), (e) or (f) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to the Issuer.

  Re:    Avis Budget Finance plc (the    Issuer   ) 4.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (the    Notes   ) 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  In connection with our proposed sale of  [________] aggregate principal amount of the Notes, we confirm that such sale has been effected pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the    Securities Act   ), and, accordingly, we represent that: 
  (a)    the offer of the Notes was not made to a person in the United States; 
  (b)    either (i) at the time the buy order was originated, the transferee was outside the United States or we and any person acting on our behalf reasonably believed that the transferee was outside the United States or (ii) the transaction was executed in, on or through the facilities  
  
   76 

of a designated off-shore securities market and neither we nor any person acting on our behalf knows that the transaction has been pre-arranged with a buyer in the United States; 
  (c)    no directed selling efforts have been made in the United States in contravention of the requirements of Rule 903(a)(2) or Rule 904(a)(2) of Regulation S, as applicable; and 
  (d)    the transaction is not part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
  In addition, if the sale is made during a restricted period and the provisions of Rule 903(b)(2), Rule 903(b)(3) or Rule 904(b)(1) of Regulation S are applicable thereto, we confirm that such sale has been made in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 903(b)(2), Rule 903(b)(3) or Rule 904(b)(1), as the case may be. 
  We also hereby certify that we [are][are not] an Affiliate of the Issuer and, to our knowledge, the transferee of the Notes [is][is not] an Affiliate of the Issuer. 
  The Trustee, Registrar and the Issuer are entitled to conclusively rely upon this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceedings or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.  Terms used in this certificate have the meanings set forth in Regulation S.

SECTION 2.10        [Reserved]  . 

77 

SECTION 2.11        Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes  .  If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Note claims that the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met, such that the Holder (a) satisfies the Issuer or the Trustee that such Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken within a reasonable time after such Holder has notice of such loss, destruction or wrongful taking and the Registrar has not registered a transfer prior to receiving such notification, (b) makes such request to the Issuer and the Trustee and the Registrar prior to the Note being acquired by a protected purchaser as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code (a    protected purchaser   ), (c) satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Issuer, such Holder shall furnish a reasonable indemnity bond sufficient in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee to protect the Issuer, Trustee, a Paying Agent and the Registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. 
  In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note. 
  Upon the issuance of any new Note under this   Section 2.11  , the Issuer may require that such Holder pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and of the Trustee) in connection therewith. 
  Subject to the proviso in the initial paragraph of this   Section 2.11  , every new Note issued pursuant to this   Section 2.11  , in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, any Guarantor (if applicable) and any other obligor upon the Notes, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder. 
  The provisions of this   Section 2.11   are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes. 
  SECTION 2.12        Outstanding Notes  .  Notes outstanding at any time are all Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those paid pursuant to   Section 2.11   and those described in this   Section 2.12   as not outstanding.  A Note does not cease to be outstanding in the event the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer holds the Note;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) for purposes of determining which are  
  
   78 

outstanding for consent or voting purposes hereunder, the provisions of   Section 12.6   shall apply and (ii) in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in making a determination whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Notes are present at a meeting of Holders of Notes for quorum purposes or have consented to or voted in favor of any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, amendment or modification hereunder, or relying upon any such quorum, consent or vote, only Notes which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Registrar actually knows to be held by the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer shall not be considered outstanding. 
  If a Note is replaced pursuant to   Section 2.11   (other than a mutilated Note surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee or the Registrar and the Issuer receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.  A mutilated Note ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Note and replacement pursuant to   Section 2.11  . 
  If the Paying Agent holds (and in case of any Paying Agent that is not a party to this Indenture and that is not an Affiliate of the Trustee, holds in trust), in accordance with this Indenture, on a Redemption Date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest payable on that date with respect to the Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Notes (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. 
  SECTION 2.13        Temporary Notes  .  In the event that Definitive Notes are to be issued under the terms of this Indenture, until such Definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuer may prepare and the Trustee or Authenticating Agent shall authenticate temporary Notes.  Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form, and shall carry all rights, of Definitive Notes but may have variations that the Issuer considers appropriate for temporary Notes.  Without unreasonable delay, the Issuer shall prepare and the Trustee or Authenticating Agent shall authenticate Definitive Notes.  After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at any office or agency maintained by the Issuer for that purpose and such exchange shall be without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee or Authenticating Agent shall, upon receipt of an Issuer Order, authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor, one or more Definitive Notes representing an equal principal amount of Notes.  Until so exchanged, the Holder of temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as a Holder of Definitive Notes. 
  
   79 

SECTION 2.14        Cancellation  .  The Issuer at any time may deliver Notes to the Registrar for cancellation.  The Registrar shall automatically cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and dispose of such Notes in accordance with its internal policies and customary procedures (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act).  If the Issuer or any Guarantor acquires any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Registrar for cancellation pursuant to this   Section 2.14  .  The Issuer may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has paid or delivered to the Registrar for cancellation for any reason other than in connection with a transfer or exchange. 
  At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Note have either been exchanged for Definitive Notes, transferred, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be returned by the Common Depositary to the Registrar for cancellation or retained and canceled by the Registrar.  At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Definitive Notes, transferred in exchange for an interest in another Global Note, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Registrar   with respect to such Global Note, by the Registrar, to reflect such reduction. 
  SECTION 2.15        Payment of Interest; Defaulted Interest  .  Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such payment at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose pursuant to   Section 2.3  . 
  Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not paid when the same becomes due and payable and such nonpayment continues for a period of 30 days shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the regular record date, and such defaulted interest and (to the extent lawful) interest on such defaulted interest at the rate borne by the Notes (such defaulted interest and interest thereon herein collectively called    Defaulted Interest   ) shall be paid by the Issuer, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below: 
  (a)        The Issuer may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date (as defined below) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date (not less than 30 days after such notice) of the proposed payment (the    Special Interest Payment Date   ), and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent an amount of money  
  
   80 

equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this   Section 2.15(a)  ;   provided   that, the Paying Agent that is a party to this Indenture or that is an Affiliate of the Trustee shall treat such money received by it as any other banker and shall not be required to hold such money in trust for the benefit of any Person. Thereupon the Issuer shall fix a record date (the    Special Record Date   ) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which date shall be not more than 20 calendar days and not less than 15 calendar days prior to the Special Interest Payment Date and not less than 10 calendar days after the receipt by the Paying Agent of the notice of the proposed payment.  The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent in writing of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, the Trustee shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in   Section 12.2  , not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor having been so given, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid on the Special Interest Payment Date to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the provisions in   Section 2.15(b)  . 
  (b)        The Issuer may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent of the proposed payment pursuant to this   Section 2.15(b)  , such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Paying Agent. 
  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.15  , each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of, transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note. 
  SECTION 2.16        Common Code and ISIN Numbers  .  The Issuer in issuing the Notes may use  Common Code  and/or  ISIN  numbers and, if so, the Trustee shall use  Common Code  and/or  ISIN  numbers in notices of redemption or purchase as a convenience to Holders;   provided  ,   however  , that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption or purchase and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption or purchase shall not be affected by any defect in  
  
   81 

or omission of such Common Code and/or ISIN numbers.  The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee and Registrar in writing of any change in the Common Code and/or ISIN numbers.  
  ARTICLE III      COVENANTS 
  SECTION 3.1        Payment of Notes  .  The Issuer shall promptly pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose or, at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the Notes Register provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by the Common Depositary or its nominee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. 
  SECTION 3.2        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.3        Limitation on Restricted Payments  . 
  (a)        The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

  (2)        in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) with a purchase price in excess of $50.0 million, other than in a sale of the Budget Truck Division for fair market value, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise), together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and 
  (3)        an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied: 
  (A)        to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor, any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;   provided  ,   however  , that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i), the Company or Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase;   provided     further   that, to the extent the Company or Restricted Subsidiary redeems, repays or repurchases Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under   Section 5.7   through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in

  (B)        to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;   provided  ,   however  , that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment; 
  provided that  , pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (A) or clause (B) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by this Indenture. 
  (b)        The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute    Excess Proceeds    under this Indenture. On the 366th day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under this Indenture exceeds (i) $100.0 million, in the case of a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or (ii) $200.0 million aggregate amount in any fiscal year, the Issuer shall within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (   Asset Disposition Offer   ) to all Holders of Notes issued under this Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of  100,000 and in integral multiples of  1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer shall deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the Notes Register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depositary, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to  
  
   91 

repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by this Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. 
  (c)        To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer or the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by this Indenture. 
  (d)        To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this   Section 3.5  , (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a    Foreign Disposition   ) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this   Section 3.5  , and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions available under the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be promptly  
  
   92 

effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than three (3) Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this   Section 3.5   and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any repatriation whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a tax liability, including as a result of a dividend or deemed dividend, or a withholding tax, but taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit received in connection with such repatriation) with respect to such Net Available Cash, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary.  
  (f)        For the purposes of   Section 3.5(a)(2)  , the following will be deemed to be cash:

  (2)        securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; 
  (3)        Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; 
  (4)        consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and 
  (5)        any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this   Section 3.5   that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $300.0 million and 1.75% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of  
  
   93 

Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). 
  (g)        The Issuer shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this Indenture by virtue thereof. 
  The provisions of this Indenture relative to the Issuer s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

  (c)        The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Repurchase Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to   Section 5.3  , unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. 
  (d)        In the event that Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the Notes held by such Holders, the Company will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days  prior notice, given not more than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described in this   Section 3.9  , to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid  
  
   98 

interest on the notes that remain outstanding, to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date).  
  (e)        While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of the Depositary, subject to its rules and regulations. 
  (f)        On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:  
  (1)        accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;  
  (2)        deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and  
  (3)        deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer.  
  SECTION 3.10        Reports  . 
  (a)        Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise required to report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Issue Date, the Company will furnish to the Trustee, within 15 days after the time periods specified below:

   99 

(3)        promptly after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form (if the Company had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act);   provided  , that the foregoing shall not obligate the Company to (i) make available any information otherwise required to be included on a Form 8 K regarding the occurrence of any such events if the Company determines in its good faith judgment that such event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders of the Notes or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) make available copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K:

  (H)        the appointment or departure of directors or executive officers; 
  (I)        non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and 
  (J)        change of control transactions, 
  in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form, except as described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the Offering Memorandum;   provided  ,   however  , that the Company shall not be required to (i) comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any  non-GAAP  financial information contained therein, (ii) provide any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in the Offering Memorandum or (iii) provide the type of information contemplated by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X with respect to separate financial statements for Guarantors or the Issuer or any financial statements for unconsolidated subsidiaries or 50% or less owned persons  
  
   100 

contemplated by Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, or in each cash any successor provisions. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured;   provided   that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under   Section 6.1   if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company shall agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it shall furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. 
  (b)        Delivery of the information, documents and reports described in   Section 3.10(a)   to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee s receipt of the foregoing shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein, or determinable from information contained therein, including compliance by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries with any of our covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer s Certificate). 
  Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant to   Section 3.10(a)  , the Company shall also post copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, prospective investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to  qualified institutional buyers  within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), and securities analysts and market-making financial institutions that are reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 
  (c)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under this covenant, will for the 365 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate equal to 0.50% per annum (such interest,  
  
   101 

Additional Interest   ). This Additional Interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest payable under this Indenture. This Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above under this covenant first occurs to, but excluding, the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such Additional Interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under   Section 6.3  . 
  (d)        Notwithstanding anything in this   Section 3.10   to the contrary, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in this   Section 3.10   with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this   Section 3.10  ;   provided   that, if the financial information so furnished or filed relates to any Parent Entity, the same is accompanied by consolidating information, that explains in reasonable detail (including selected quantitative metrics) the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity or Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited;   provided   that the Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine whether such filing has occurred. 
  SECTION 3.11        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.12        Maintenance of Office or Agency  .  The Issuer will maintain an office or agency where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for payment and where, if applicable, the Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange. The corporate trust office of the Trustee, located at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, 60 Wall Street, 16th Floor, MS NYC 60-1630, New York, New York, 10005, shall be such office or agency of the Issuer, unless the Issuer shall designate and maintain some other office or agency for one or more of such purposes.  The Issuer will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change in the location of any such office or agency.  If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and surrenders may be made or served at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, and the Issuer hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations and surrenders. 
  The Issuer may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from  
  
   102 

time to time rescind any such designation.  The Issuer will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and any change in the location of any such other office or agency. 
  SECTION 3.13        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.14        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.15        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.16        Compliance Certificate  .  The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after January 1, 2016, an Officer s Certificate to the effect that to the best knowledge of the signer thereof the Issuer is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Issuer shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which such signer may have knowledge. The individual signing any certificate given by any Person pursuant to this   Section 3.16   shall be the principal executive, financial or accounting Officer or a Director of such Person. 
  SECTION 3.17        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.18        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 3.19        Statement by Officers as to Default  .  The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default under   Sections 6.1(4)   or   6.1(5)   and any event that with the giving of notice or a lapse of time would become an Event of Default under   Sections 6.1(3)   or   6.1(6)  , an Officer s Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or Default, its status and the actions which the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. 
  SECTION 3.20        Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries  .  The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described in   Section 3.3   or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted  
  
   103 

Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default or the Subsidiary will be a Special Purpose Subsidiary. 
  Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by   Section 3.3  . If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date. 
  The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company;   provided   that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation or if the Subsidiary will be a Special Purpose Subsidiary. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions. 
  SECTION 3.21        Suspension of Certain Covenants  . 
  (a)        If, on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture, then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be subject to   Section 3.7   (the    Suspended Covenant   ). 
  (b)        If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status and while the Notes do not have Investment Grade Status the Company issues new capital markets debt securities with Subsidiary Guarantees, then the Suspended Covenant will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenant had never been suspended (the    Reversion Date   ) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of this Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of this Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenant shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status);   provided  ,   however  , that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenant based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during  
  
   104 

the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the Suspended Covenant remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenant and the Reversion Date is referred to as the    Suspension Period  .  
  On the Reversion Date, all Liens Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to the definition of  Permitted Liens  (to the extent such Liens would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Liens Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Liens would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the definition of  Permitted Liens,  such Liens will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of  Permitted Liens.  During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. 
  The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of the commencement of any Suspension Period promptly, and in any event not later than five Business Days after the commencement thereof. In the absence of such notice, the Company shall give the Trustee written notice of the termination of any Suspension Period not later than five Business Days after the occurrence thereof. After any such notice of the termination of any Suspension Period, the Trustee shall assume the Suspended Covenants apply and are in full force and effect.  
  (c)        The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date. 
  SECTION 3.22        Termination of Certain Covenants  . 
  (a)        If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture, then, beginning on that day, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will permanently no longer be subject to   Sections 3.3  ,   3.5   and clause (3) of   Section 4.1(a)   (collectively, the    Terminated Covenants   ).  
  Following the achievement of Investment Grade Status, notwithstanding that the Notes may cease to have such Investment Grade Status or a Default or Event of Default may occur, the Terminated Covenants will be inapplicable to the parties to this Indenture and have no further force and effect. 
  
   105 

(b)        The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status, and shall assume the Terminated Covenants are in effect until it is notified in writing that the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status.

  (3)        immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) in the case of the Company, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the applicable Successor Company is at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the Successor Company thereto) would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; 
  (4)        each applicable Subsidiary Guarantor (other than (a) any Subsidiary Guarantor that will be released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee in connection with such transaction and (b) any party to any such consolidation or merger) shall have delivered a supplemental indenture or other document  
  
   106

  (c)        The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company or the Issuer, as applicable, under the Notes or the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Notes or the Indenture.

  (1)        the redemption date; 
  (2)        the redemption price;

If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.

  (r)        The permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties. 
  SECTION 7.3        Individual Rights of Trustee  .  The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer, the Guarantors or their Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.  Any Agent or its Affiliates may do the same with like rights.  However, the Trustee must comply with   Section 7.10  .  In addition, the Trustee shall be permitted to engage in transactions with the Company. 
  SECTION 7.4        Trustee s Disclaimer  .  The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, shall not be accountable for the Issuer s use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes, shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee or any money paid to the Issuer pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and shall not be responsible for any statement of the Issuer in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Trustee s certificate of authentication. 
  SECTION 7.5        Notice of Defaults  .  If a Default occurs and is continuing and if a Responsible Officer is informed of such occurrence by the Company or the Issuer, the Trustee shall give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company or the Issuer.  Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long it in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders. 
  SECTION 7.6        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 7.7        Compensation and Indemnity  .  The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time compensation for its services hereunder and under the Notes as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing.  The Trustee s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.  The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including, but not limited to, costs of collection, costs of preparing reports, certificates and other documents, costs of preparation and mailing of notices to Holders.  Such  
  
   123 

expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the agents, counsel, accountants and experts of the Trustee.  The Company shall indemnify the Trustee and its respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from and against any and all loss, liability, damages, claims or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon the income of the Trustee) (including reasonable attorneys  and agents  fees and expenses) incurred by it without willful misconduct or gross negligence, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, on its part in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder and under the Notes, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture (including this   Section 7.7  ) and the Notes and of defending itself against any claims (whether asserted by any Holder, the Company or otherwise).  The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity of which it has received written notice.  Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall provide reasonable cooperation at the Company s expense in the defense.  The Trustee may have one separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. 
  To secure the Company s payment obligations in this   Section 7.7  , the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.  Such lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, of the appointment of any successor Trustee.  The Trustee s right to receive payment of any amounts due under this   Section 7.7   shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company. 
  The Company s payment and other obligations pursuant to this   Section 7.7   shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and any resignation or removal of the Trustee under   Section 7.8  .  Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs fees, expenses or renders services after the occurrence of a Default specified in clause (7) or clause (8) of   Section 6.1  , the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law. 
  SECTION 7.8        Replacement of Trustee  .  The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Issuer in writing not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of such resignation.  The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the removed Trustee in writing not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of such removal and may appoint a successor Trustee with the Issuer s written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  The Issuer shall remove the Trustee if: 
  (1)        the Trustee fails to comply with   Section 7.10   hereof; 
  (2)        the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; 
  
   124 

(3)        a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or 
  (4)        the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. 
  If the Trustee resigns or is removed by the Issuer or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee as described in the preceding paragraph, or if a vacancy exists in the office of the Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. 
  A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuer.  Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.  The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders.  The retiring Trustee shall, at the expense of the Issuer, promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in   Section 7.7  , and the recognition thereof by the successor Trustee. 
  If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Notes may petition, at the Issuer s expense, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. 
  If the Trustee fails to comply with   Section 7.10  , any Holder, who has been a bona fide holder of a Note for at least six months, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. 
  Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this   Section 7.8  , the Company s obligations under   Section 7.7   shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.  The predecessor Trustee shall have no liability for any action or inaction of any successor Trustee. 
  SECTION 7.9        Successor Trustee by Merger  .  If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. 
  In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of  
  
   125 

authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee;   provided     that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or authenticate Notes in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall only apply to its successor or successors by merger, consolidation or conversion. 
  SECTION 7.10        Eligibility; Disqualification  .  The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.   
  SECTION 7.11        [Reserved]  . 
  SECTION 7.12        Trustee s Application for Instruction from the Issuer  .  Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Issuer may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than three Business Days after the date any Officer of the Issuer actually receives such application, unless any such Officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted. 
  SECTION 7.13        Paying Agent  . 
  (a)        Certain Duties and Responsibilities of the Paying Agent: 
  (1)        the Paying Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Paying Agent.

  Without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder: 
  
   134 

(1)        reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment; 
  (2)        reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than provisions relating to   Section 3.5   and   Section 3.9  ); 
  (3)        reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note; 
  (4)        reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as set forth in   Section 5.7  ; 
  (5)        make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note; 
  (6)        impair the right entitling any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder s Notes on or after the due dates therefor; 
  (7)        waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or 
  (8)        make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders  consent described in this   Section 9.2  . 
  It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.  A consent to any amendment or waiver under this Indenture by any Holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. 
  After an amendment or supplement under this   Section 9.2   becomes effective, the Issuer shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement.  The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment or supplement. 
  SECTION 9.3        [Reserved]  . 
  
   135 

SECTION 9.4        Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers  .  Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on any Note.  However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder s Note or portion of its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.  An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. 
  The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture.  If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.  No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date. 
  SECTION 9.5        Notation on or Exchange of Notes  .  The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated.  The Issuer in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Issuer Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. 
  Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. 
  SECTION 9.6        Trustee and Paying Agent Sign Amendments  .  The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Paying Agent. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will be entitled to receive and (subject to   Sections 7.1   and   7.2   hereof) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, in addition to the documents required by   Section 12.4   hereof, an Officer s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and is valid, binding and enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms.

ARTICLE X      GUARANTEE 
  SECTION 10.1        Guarantee  .  Subject to the provisions of this   Article X  , each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes, and the Trustee the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Issuer under this Indenture (including without limitation interest accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, relating to the Issuer or any Guarantor whether or not a claim for post-filing or Post-Petition Interest is allowed in such proceeding and the obligations under   Section 7.7  ) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the    Guaranteed Obligations   ).  Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other Indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guaranteed Obligations, in which case the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to such other Indebtedness. 
  To evidence its Guarantee set forth in this   Section 10.1  , each Guarantor hereby agrees that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by an Officer of such Guarantor. 
  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in this   Section 10.1   shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the absence of the endorsement of any notation of such Guarantee on the Notes. 
  If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless. 
  Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this   Article X   notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation. 
  Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the issuer of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment.  Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. 
  
   137 

Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a Guarantee of payment when due (and not a Guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
  Except as set forth in   Section 10.2  , the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Issuer or any other person under this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder for the Guaranteed Obligations; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Issuer; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity. 
  Each Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Guarantee in compliance with   Section 10.2  ,   Article VIII   or   Article XI  .  Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Interest, if any, on any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer or otherwise. 
  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Issuer to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) on such Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) (including interest accruing after the filing of any petition in  
  
   138 

bankruptcy or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding relating to the Issuer or any Guarantor whether or not a claim for post-filing or Post-Petition Interest is allowed in such proceeding). 
  Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee. 
  Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys  fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section. 
  SECTION 10.2        Limitation on Liability; Termination, Release and Discharge  . 
  (a)        Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Indenture, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal, foreign or state law and not otherwise being void or voidable under any similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 
  (b)        Any Guarantee of a Guarantor shall terminate upon: 
  (1)        a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise permitted by this Indenture; 
  (2)        the designation in accordance with this Indenture of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; 
  
   139 

(3)        defeasance or discharge of the Notes pursuant to   Article VIII   or   Article XI  ; 
  (4)        to the extent that such Subsidiary Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of  Immaterial Subsidiary,  upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such clause; or 
  (5)        such Guarantor, other than the Indirect Parent or the Company, being released of its Guarantee, (x) has been released from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an    Other Guarantee   ) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor pursuant to   Section 3.7  , the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such Indebtedness of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated); 
  (6)        in the case of the Subsidiary Guarantees, the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes pursuant to   Section 3.22  ;   provided   that such Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date pursuant to   Section 3.21  . 
  SECTION 10.3        Right of Contribution  .  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that any Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made on the obligations under the Guarantees, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against the Issuer or any other Guarantor who has not paid its proportionate share of such payment.  The provisions of this   Section 10.3   shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor to the Trustee and the Holders and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Trustee and the Holders for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder. 
  SECTION 10.4        No Subrogation  .  Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by each Guarantor hereunder, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Trustee or any Holder against the Issuer or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Trustee or any Holder for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Issuer or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Trustee and the Holders by the Issuer on account of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full.  If any amount shall be paid to any  
  
   140 

Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Trustee and the Holders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Trustee in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Trustee, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations. 
  ARTICLE XI      SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE 
  SECTION 11.1        Satisfaction and Discharge  .  This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, when: 
  (a)        either: 
  (1)        all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or 
  (2)        all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable or (ii) will become due and payable within one year at their Stated Maturity or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee, in the name, and at the expense of the Issuer; 
  (b)        the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee money in Euros, U.S. dollars, or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; 
  (c)        the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer under this Indenture; and 
  (d)        the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied;   provided   that any such counsel may rely on an Officer s Certificate as to matters of fact (including compliance with clauses (a), (b) and (c) in this   Section 11.1  ). 
  
   141 

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money has been deposited with the Registrar pursuant to clause (b) of this   Section 11.1  , the provisions of   Sections 11.2   and   8.6   hereof will survive. 
  SECTION 11.2        Application of Trust Money  .  Subject to the provisions of   Section 8.6   hereof, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to   Section 11.1   hereof shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium) and interest and Additional Interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 
  If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with   Section 11.1   hereof by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or Governmental Authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuer s and any Guarantor s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to   Section 11.1   hereof;   provided     that if the Issuer has made any payment of principal of, or premium or interest on, any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee.

  All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given by the Issuer to any Agent under this Indenture shall be in the English language or, if not in English and if so required by the Agent, be accompanied by a certified English translation. 
  All notices to Holders of Notes shall be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses in the Notes Register and shall be sufficiently given if so sent within the time prescribed. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or any Note, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes and where this Indenture or any Note provides for notice of any event (including any notice of redemption or purchase) to Holders of Notes (whether by mail or otherwise), such notice shall be sufficiently given if given to the Depositary (or its designee), pursuant to the standing instructions from the Depositary or its designee, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

  SECTION 12.3        [Reserved]  .

  (2)        an Opinion of Counsel in form satisfactory to the Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in   Section 12.5   hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been satisfied and all covenants have been complied with. 
  SECTION 12.5        Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion  .  Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a covenant or condition provided for in this Indenture shall include: 
  (1)        a statement that the individual making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition;

  SECTION 12.6        When Notes Disregarded  .  In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Affiliate of them shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.  Also, subject to the foregoing, only Notes outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination. 
  SECTION 12.7        Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar  .  The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by, or at meetings of, Holders.  The Registrar and the Paying Agent may make reasonable rules for their functions. 
  SECTION 12.8        Legal Holidays  . A    Legal Holiday    is a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law to be closed in New York, New York or the jurisdiction of the place of payment.  If a payment date or Redemption Date is a Legal Holiday, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period (unless otherwise required).  If a regular record date is a Legal Holiday, the record date shall not be affected. 
  SECTION 12.9        Governing Law  .  THIS INDENTURE, THE NOTES AND THE GUARANTEES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
  SECTION 12.10        Jurisdiction  .  The Issuer and the Guarantors agree that any suit, action or proceeding against the Issuer or any Guarantor brought by any Holder, the Trustee arising out of or based upon this Indenture, the Guarantee or the Notes may be instituted in any state or Federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of them irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding.  The Issuer and the Guarantors irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to any suit, action, or proceeding that may be brought in connection with this Indenture, the Guarantee or the Notes, including such actions, suits or proceedings relating to securities laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, in such courts whether on the grounds of venue, residence or domicile or on the ground that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  The Issuer  
  
   146 

and the Guarantors agree that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, and may be enforced in any court to the jurisdiction of which the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, are subject by a suit upon such judgment. 
  SECTION 12.11        Waivers of Jury Trial  .    THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS, THE TRUSTEE AND THE PAYING AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE NOTES OR THE GUARANTEES AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN  . 
  SECTION 12.12        USA PATRIOT Act Section 326 Customer Identification Program  .  In order to comply with the laws, rules, regulations and executive orders in effect from time to time applicable to banking institutions, including, without limitation, those relating to the funding of terrorist activities and money laundering, including Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act of the United States, the Trustee is required to obtain, verify, record and update certain information relating to individuals and entities which maintain a business relationship with the Trustee. Accordingly, each of the parties to this Indenture agrees to provide to the Trustee, upon its request from time to time, such identifying information and documentation as may be available for such party in order to enable the Trustee to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act. 
  SECTION 12.13        No Recourse Against Others  .  No director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or such (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors), shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.  Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. 
  SECTION 12.14        Successors  .  All agreements of the Issuer and each Guarantor in this Indenture and the Notes shall bind their respective successors.  All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors. 
  SECTION 12.15        Multiple Originals  .  The parties may sign any number of copies of this Indenture.  Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement.  The exchange of copies of this Indenture and of signature pages by facsimile or PDF

Signatures of the parties hereto transmitted by facsimile or PDF shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.

The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture.  The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of such terms.  Additional Notes may be issued under the Indenture which will vote as a class with the Notes and otherwise be treated as Notes for purposes of the Indenture. 
    
  All terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. 
    
  This Note may hereafter be entitled to certain Guarantees made for the benefit of the Holders.  Reference is made to Article X of the Indenture for terms relating to such Guarantees, including the release, termination and discharge thereof.  Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to make any notation on this Note to reflect any Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. 
    
  The Notes will be redeemable, at the Issuer s option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after November 15, 2019, and prior to maturity at the applicable redemption price set forth below.  Such redemption may be made upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days  prior notice by electronic delivery or first-class mail, postage prepaid, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder s registered address in accordance with the Indenture.  The Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.  Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control.  The Notes will be so redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest thereon, if any, to the relevant Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant regular record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 1 of each of the years set forth below: 

In addition, at any time and from time to time on or prior to November 15, 2019, the Issuer at its option may redeem Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes), with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of 104.125% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company or the Issuer of one or more Equity Offerings of the Company or the  Issuer;   provided  ,   however  , that an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption.  The Issuer may make such redemption upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days  prior notice mailed by electronic delivery or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder s registered address in accordance with the Indenture (but in no event more than 180 days after the completion of the related Equity Offering).

The Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the Redemption Price and performance of the Issuer s obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person.   
    
  Notice of any redemption of the Notes in connection with a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness or a Change of Control) may, at the Issuer s discretion, be given prior to the completion thereof and any redemption or notice of redemption may, at the Issuer s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related transaction.  If such redemption or  

purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.  In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. 
    
  The Indenture provides that, upon the occurrence after the Issue Date of a Change of Control, each Holder will have the right to require that the Issuer repurchase all or any part of such Holder s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of such repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date);   provided  ,   however  , that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase the Notes in the event it has previously or concurrently exercised its right to redeem all the outstanding Notes as described above.

  The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 
    
  As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to pursue such remedy in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee, the Holders offered the Trustee in writing security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense, the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes at the time outstanding a written direction, that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. 
    
  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 
    
  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Notes Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in a place of payment, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder s attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. 
    
  The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of  100,000 and any integral multiple of  l,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in  

the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 
    
  No service charge shall be made for any such registration, transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
    
  Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration or transfer, the Issuer, any other obligor in respect of this Note, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, such other obligor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, any other obligor upon this Note, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 
    
  No director, officer, employee, incorporator, equity holder, member or stockholder, as such, of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any thereof shall have any liability for any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, any such obligation or its creation.  Each Holder, by accepting this Note, hereby waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

THE TRUSTEE, THE ISSUER, ANY OTHER OBLIGOR IN RESPECT OF THE NOTES AND (BY THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOTES) THE HOLDERS, AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE INDENTURE, THE NOTES OR THE GUARANTEES.

Reference is made to Article X of the Indenture for terms relating to such Guarantees, including the release, termination and discharge thereof.  Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to make any notation on this Note to reflect any Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge.

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control.  The Notes will be so redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest thereon, if any, to the relevant Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant regular  

record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 1 of each of the years set forth below: 

In addition, at any time and from time to time on or prior to November 15, 2019, the Issuer at its option may redeem Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes), with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of 104.125% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company or the Issuer of one or more Equity Offerings of the Company or the  Issuer;   provided  ,   however  , that an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption.

If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.  In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes to be effected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Paying Agent with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 
  As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to pursue such remedy in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee, the Holders offered the Trustee in writing security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense, the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes at the time outstanding a written direction, that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. 
  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 
  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Notes Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in a place of payment, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder s attorney duly authorized in  

writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. 
  The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of  100,000 and any integral multiple of  l,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 
  No service charge shall be made for any such registration, transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
  Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration or transfer, the Issuer, any other obligor in respect of this Note, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, such other obligor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, any other obligor upon this Note, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 
  No director, officer, employee, incorporator, equity holder, member or stockholder, as such, of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any thereof shall have any liability for any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, any such obligation or its creation.  Each Holder, by accepting this Note, hereby waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
