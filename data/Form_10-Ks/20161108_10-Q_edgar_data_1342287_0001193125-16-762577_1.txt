    Non-cash investing and financing activities:  
  On August 12, 2015 and August 10, 2016, the Board of Directors of Royal Wolf declared a dividend of AUS$0.05 and AUS$0.025 per RWH share
payable on October 2, 2015 and October 4, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 17, 2015 and September 16, 2016, respectively. The condensed consolidated financial statements accrued the amount of the dividend pertaining to the

  The Company included non-cash holdback and other adjustment amounts totaling $752 and $222 as part of the consideration for business
acquisitions during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively (see Note 4).    The accompanying notes are an integral part

   GENERAL FINANCE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)      Note 1. Organization and
Business Operations      General Finance Corporation ( GFN ) was incorporated in Delaware in October 2005. References
to the  Company  in these Notes are to GFN and its consolidated subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include GFN U.S. Australasia Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( GFN U.S.  GFN Insurance Corporation, an Arizona corporation
( GFNI  GFN North America Leasing Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( GFNNA Leasing  GFN North America Corp., a Delaware corporation ( GFNNA  GFN Realty Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
( GFNRC  GFN Manufacturing Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( GFNMC ), and its 90%-owned subsidiary, Southern Frac, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (collectively  Southern Frac  over 50%-owned Royal Wolf
Holdings Limited, an Australian corporation publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange ( RWH ), and its Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries (collectively,  Royal Wolf  Pac-Van, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and
its Canadian subsidiary, PV Acquisition Corp., an Alberta corporation (collectively  Pac-Van  and Lone Star Tank Rental Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Lone Star ).  
  The Company does business in three distinct, but related industries, mobile storage, modular space and liquid containment (which are
collectively referred to as the  portable services industry ), in two geographic areas; the Asia-Pacific (or Pan-Pacific) area, consisting of Royal Wolf (which leases and sells storage containers, portable container buildings and freight
containers in Australia and New Zealand) and North America, consisting of Pac-Van (which leases and sells storage, office and portable liquid storage tank containers, modular buildings and mobile offices) and Lone Star (which leases portable liquid
storage tank containers and containment products, as well as provides certain fluid management services, to the oil and gas industry in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas), which are combined to form our North American leasing operations,
and Southern Frac (which manufactures portable liquid storage tank containers).     Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
  Basis of Presentation      The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information and the instructions
to  Form 10-Q  and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements, although the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016 was derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheet at that date. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include all significant normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The accompanying results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the entire fiscal
year ending June 30, 2017. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of the Company, which are included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  
  Unless otherwise indicated, references to  FY 2016  and  FY 2017  are to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and
2016, respectively.     Principles of Consolidation   
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.     Use of Estimates   
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes include assumptions used in assigning value to identifiable
intangible assets at the acquisition date, the assessment for impairment of goodwill, the assessment for impairment of other intangible assets, the allowance for doubtful accounts, share-based compensation expense, residual value of the lease fleet
and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Assumptions and factors used in the estimates are evaluated on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the previous assumptions and factors have changed. The results
of the analysis could result in adjustments to estimates.

   Inventories   
  Inventories are comprised of the following (in thousands):      
    Property, Plant and Equipment   
  Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):  
   
    Lease Fleet   
  The Company has a fleet of storage, portable building, office and portable liquid storage tank containers, mobile offices, modular
buildings and steps that it primarily leases to customers under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Units in the lease fleet are also available for sale. The cost of sales of a unit in the lease fleet is recognized at the
carrying amount at the date of sale. At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the gross costs of the lease fleet were $503,817,000 and $514,320,000, respectively.  
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   
  The purchase consideration of acquired businesses have been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair
values on the respective acquisition dates (see Note 4). Based on these values, the excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 350,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other.    FASB ASC Topic 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires these assets be reviewed for impairment. The Company operates two
reportable geographic areas and the vast majority of goodwill recorded was in the acquisitions of Royal Wolf, Pac-Van, Southern Frac and Lone Star.   The
Company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or if a determination is made based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50%) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. At March 31, 2016, the Company determined that qualitative factors in its North American leasing and manufacturing operations, pertaining primarily to conditions in the oil and gas market, required an update of the step one
impairment analysis for Lone Star and Southern Frac. This updated analysis calculated that even though the excess of the estimated fair value of Lone Star over the carrying value of its invested capital declined, its implied value of goodwill was
still greater than its carrying value. However, the Company determined that the implied value of Southern Frac s goodwill was less than the carrying value of its goodwill, resulting in an impairment charge of $2,681,000 at March 31, 2016. At
June 30, 2016, the annual step one impairment analysis performed on the North American reporting units, Pac-Van and Lone Star, calculated that the value of goodwill was still greater than its carrying value and that the amount by which the excess of
the estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying value of invested capital at that date was approximately 21% and 12%, respectively, of their book value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and involves the
use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions.

   Other intangible assets include those with indefinite (trademark and trade name) and
finite (primarily customer base and lists, non-compete agreements and deferred financing costs), as follows (in thousands):      
    Net Income per Common Share   
  Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. The potential dilutive securities (common stock equivalents) the Company had outstanding were stock options. The following is a reconciliation of weighted
average shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per common share:      
    Potential common stock equivalents totaling 2,110,191 and 1,605,587 for FY 2016and FY 2017,
respectively, have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect is anti-dilutive.     Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).  The amendments
in this update require that debt issuance (or deferred financing) costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation
of debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15 which added SEC guidance that stated in the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would
not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding
borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted these updates in FY 2017 and, as a result, unamortized debt issuance costs totaling $2,239,000 and $2,102,000 as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, have been
deducted from the carrying amounts of the Credit Suisse Term Loan and Senior Notes (see Note 5) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Asia-Pacific and North American senior credit
facilities are included in the caption  Other intangible assets, net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.     In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( Topic 606) . ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and IASB to improve financial reporting by
creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The ASU 2014-09 revenue recognition model virtually replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and applies to all
companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. ASU 2014-09 (as updated by ASU 2015-14 in August 2015, ASU No. 2016-08 in March 2016, ASU No. 10 in April 2016 and ASU No. 12 in May 2016) is effective for public
entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Public and nonpublic entities have the choice to apply ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect
of applying ASU 2014-09 at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. The Company is evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of this ASU in the presentation of its consolidated
financial statements.

  (Unaudited)       
   In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . This new guidance was initiated as a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to simplify lease accounting and improve the quality of and comparability of financial information for users. This new
guidance would eliminate the concept of off-balance sheet treatment for  operating leases  for lessees for the vast majority of lease contracts. Under ASU No. 2016-02, at inception, a lessee must classify all leases with a term of over one
year as either finance or operating, with both classifications resulting in the recognition of a defined  right-of-use  asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. However, recognition in the income statement will differ depending on
the lease classification, with finance leases recognizing the amortization of the right-of-use asset separate from the interest on the lease liability and operating leases recognizing a single total lease expense. Lessor accounting under ASU No.
2016-02 would be substantially unchanged from the previous lease requirements under U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2016-02 will take effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted and for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition
approach. The Company believes the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have a material effect in the presentation of its consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued No. ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments , to clarify whether eight specific cash flow issues should be categorized as operating, investing or financing in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 will be effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe the requirements of this ASU will have a material effect in the presentation of its consolidated financial statements.  
  Note 3.  Equity Transactions      Preferred
Stock      Upon issuance of shares of preferred stock, the Company records the liquidation value as the preferred equity in the
consolidated balance sheet, with any underwriting discount and issuance or offering costs recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. 
   Series B Preferred Stock   
  The Company has outstanding privately-placed 8.00% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share and liquidation
value of $1,000 per share ( Series B Preferred Stock ). The Series B Preferred Stock is offered primarily in connection with business combinations. At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding 100 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference totaling $102,000. The Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible into GFN common stock, has no voting rights, except as required by Delaware law, and is redeemable after February 1, 2014; at
which time it may be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part, at the Company s option. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when declared by the Company s Board of Directors, annual dividends payable quarterly
in arrears on the 31 st  day of January, July and October and on the 30 th  day of April of each year. In the event of any liquidation or winding
up of the Company, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will have preference to holders of common stock.      Series C
Preferred Stock     The Company has outstanding publicly-traded 9.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock,
liquidation preference $100.00 per share (the  Series C Preferred Stock ). At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference totaling
$40,620,000. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and will be payable on the 31 st  day of each January, July and October and on the 30 th  day of April when, as and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors. Commencing on May 17, 2018, the Company may redeem, at its option, the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part,
at a cash redemption price of $100.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date. Among other things, the Series C Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or other
mandatory redemption, and is not convertible into or exchangeable for any of the Company s other securities. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock generally will have no voting rights, except for limited voting rights if dividends payable on
the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive quarters, and under certain other circumstances. If the Company fails to maintain the listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on the NASDAQ
Stock Market ( NASDAQ ) for 30 days or more, the per annum dividend rate will increase by an additional 2.00% per $100.00 stated liquidation value ($2.00 per annum per share) so long as the listing failure continues. In addition, in the
event of any liquidation or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will have preference to holders of common stock and are pair passu with the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is listed on NASDAQ
under the symbol  GFNCP.

    Dividends   
  As of September 30, 2016, since issuance, dividends paid or payable totaled $79,000 for the Series B Preferred Stock and dividends paid
totaled $11,710,000 for the Series C Preferred Stock. The characterization of dividends to the recipients for Federal income tax purposes is made based upon the earnings and profits of the Company, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. 
  Royal Wolf Dividends      On August
12, 2015, the Board of Directors of Royal Wolf declared a dividend of AUS$0.05 per RWH share payable on October 2, 2015 to shareholders of record on September 17, 2015. On August 10, 2016, the Board of Directors of Royal Wolf declared a
dividend of AUS$0.025 per RWH share payable on October 4, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 16, 2016.    The consolidated
financial statements reflect the amount of the dividends pertaining to the noncontrolling interest.     Note 4. Acquisitions   
  The Company can enhance its business and market share by entering into new markets in various ways, including starting up a new location
or acquiring a business consisting of container, modular unit or mobile office assets of another entity. An acquisition generally provides the Company with operations that enables it to at least cover existing overhead costs and is preferable
to a start-up or greenfield location. The businesses discussed below were acquired primarily to expand the Company s container lease fleet. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired
businesses from the dates of acquisition.     On July 22, 2016, the Company, through Pac-Van, purchased the container business of The
Great Container Company, Ltd. ( GCC ), for $662,000 (C$869,000), which included holdback and other adjustment amounts totaling $102,000 (C$133,000). GCC is located in Vancouver, British Columbia.  
  On July 27, 2016, the Company, through Pac-Van, purchased the business of Container Systems Storage, Inc. ( CSS ), for
$1,667,000, which included holdback and other adjustment amounts totaling approximately $120,000. CSS, which is located in Yakima, Washington, leases and sells storage containers in the state of Washington and in northern Oregon.  
  The preliminary allocation for the acquisition in FY 2017 to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair market values was as follows (in thousands):      
   The FY 2017 operating results of all acquisitions prior to and since their respective dates of acquisition
were not considered significant.

   Goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected corporate synergies, the
assembled workforce and other factors. The goodwill recognized in both the GCC and CSS acquisitions are not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  
  The Company incurred approximately $44,000 during FY 2016 and $17,000 during FY 2017 of incremental transaction costs associated with
acquisition-related activity that were expensed as incurred and are included in selling and general expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  Note 5. Senior and Other Debt      Asia-Pacific Leasing
Senior Credit Facility      Royal Wolf has a $133,627,000 (AUS$175,000,000) secured senior credit facility, as amended, under a
common terms deed arrangement with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ( ANZ ) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA ) (the  ANZ/CBA Credit Facility ). Under the common deed arrangement of the ANZ/CBA
Credit Facility, ANZ s proportionate share of the borrowing capacity is $80,176,000 (AUS$105,000,000) and CBA s proportionate share is $53,451,000 (AUS$70,000,000). The ANZ/CBA Credit Facility has $95,448,000 (AUS$125,000,000) maturing on
July 31, 2017 (Facility A), and $38,179,000 (AUS$50,000,000) maturing on July 31, 2019 (Facility B).    Borrowings under the ANZ/CBA
Credit Facility bear interest at the bank bill swap interest rate in Australia ( BBSY ) or New Zealand ( BKBM ), plus a margin of 1.10% - 2.10% per annum on Facility A and 1.35% - 2.40% on Facility B, depending on the net debt
leverage ratio ( NDLR ), as defined. The CBA proportionate share has a minimum margin that is 0.10% higher than the ANZ proportionate share. At September 30, 2016, the 30-day and 90-day BBSY and BKBM were 1.665% and 1.79% and 2.215% and
2.25%, respectively. The ANZ/CBA Credit Facility also includes a $2,291,000 (AUS$3,000,000) sub-facility to, among other things, facilitate direct and global payments using electronic banking services. The ANZ/CBA Credit Facility, as amended, is
subject to certain financial and other customary covenants, including, among other things, compliance with specified interest coverage and net debt ratios based on earnings before interest, income taxes, impairment, depreciation and amortization and
other non-operating costs and income ( EBITDA ) on a semi-annual basis and that borrowings may not exceed a multiple of 3.5 times EBITDA, as defined, through June 30, 2016, and 3.25 times EBITDA thereafter.  
  At September 30, 2016, total borrowings and availability under the ANZ/CBA Credit Facility totaled $82,487,000 (AUS$108,027,000) and
$15,711,000 (AUS$20,576,000), respectively. Of the total borrowings, $80,452,000 (AUS$105,362,000) is drawn under Facility A and $2,035,000 (AUS$2,665,000) is drawn under Facility B. 
  The above amounts were translated based upon the exchange rate of one Australian dollar to $0.76358 U.S. dollar at September 30,
2016.    North America Senior Credit Facility   
  The North America leasing (Pac-Van and Lone Star) and manufacturing operations (Southern Frac) have a combined $232,000,000 senior
secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with a syndicate led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ) that also includes HSBC Bank USA, NA, the Private Bank and Trust Company, Capital One Business Credit Corp. and
OneWest Bank N.A. (the  Wells Fargo Credit Facility ). The Wells Fargo Credit Facility, which matures on September 7, 2017, effectively not only finances the Company s North American operations, but also the funding requirements for
the Series C Preferred Stock (see Note 3), the term loan with Credit Suisse and the publicly-traded unsecured senior notes (see below). 
  The Wells Fargo Credit Facility includes a $20,000,000 real estate sub-facility to allow the borrowers (including GFNRC) to acquire real
estate as collateral. In addition, subject to certain conditions, the amount that may be borrowed under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility may increase by $20,000,000 to a maximum of $252,000,000. The maximum amount of intercompany dividends that
Pac-Van and Lone Star are allowed to pay in each fiscal year to GFN for the funding requirements of GFN s senior and other debt and the Series C Preferred Stock are (a) the lesser of $5,000,000 for the Series C Preferred Stock or the amount
equal to the dividend rate of the Series C Preferred Stock and its aggregate liquidation preference and the actual amount of dividends required to be paid to the Series C Preferred Stock; (b) the lesser of $3,125,000 for the term loan with Credit
Suisse or the actual annual interest to be paid; and (c) $6,120,000 for the public offering of unsecured senior notes or the actual amount of annual interest required to be paid; provided that (i) the payment of such dividends does not cause a
default or event of default; (ii) each of Pac-Van and Lone Star is solvent; (iii) excess availability, as defined, is $5,000,000 or more under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility; (iv) the fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, will be greater
than 1.25 to 1.00; and (v) the dividends are paid no earlier than ten business days prior to the date they are due.

   Borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility accrue interest, at the Company s
option, either at the base rate, plus 0.5% and a range of 1.00% to 1.50%, or the LIBOR rate, plus 1.0% and a range of 2.50% to 3.00%. Borrowings under the $20,000,000 real estate sub-facility accrue interest, at the Company s option, either at
the base rate, plus a range of 1.50% to 2.00%, or the LIBOR rate, plus a range of 3.0% to 3.50%. The Wells Fargo Credit Facility contains, among other things, certain financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratios, and other covenants,
representations, warranties, indemnification provisions, and events of default that are customary for senior secured credit facilities; including a covenant that would require repayment upon a change in control, as defined. At September 30, 2016,
borrowings and availability under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility totaled $193,104,000 and $23,255,000, respectively.     Credit Suisse Term Loan   
  On March 31, 2014, the Company entered into a $25,000,000 facility agreement, as amended, with Credit Suisse ( Credit Suisse Term
Loan ) as part of the financing for the acquisition of Lone Star and, on April 3, 2014, the Company borrowed the $25,000,000 available to it. The Credit Suisse Term Loan provides that the amount borrowed will bear interest at LIBOR plus 7.50%
per year, will be payable quarterly and that all principal and interest will mature on July 1, 2017. In addition, the Credit Suisse Term Loan is secured by a first ranking pledge over substantially all shares of RWH owned by GFN U.S., requires a
certain coverage maintenance ratio in U.S. dollars based on the value of the RWH shares and, among other things, that an amount equal to six-months interest be deposited in an interest reserve account pledged to secure repayment of all amounts
borrowed. The Company has repaid, prior to maturity, $15,000,000 of the outstanding borrowings of the Credit Suisse Term Loan and, as of September 30, 2016, $9,898,000 remained outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $102,000. 
  Senior Notes      The Company has
outstanding publicly-traded senior notes (the  Senior Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of $72,000,000 ($70,000,000, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2,000,000 at September 30, 2016). The Senior Notes were issued in
minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof and pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture (the  First Supplemental Indenture ) dated as of June 18, 2014 by and between the Company and Wells Fargo, as
trustee (the  Trustee ). The First Supplemental Indenture supplements the Indenture entered into by and between the Company and the Trustee dated as of June 18, 2014 (the  Base Indenture  and, together with the First Supplemental
Indenture, the  Indenture ). The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.125% per annum, mature on July 31, 2021 and are not subject to any sinking fund. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 31, April
30, July 31 and October 31, commencing on July 31, 2014.     The Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the
Company s existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of its existing and future subordinated debt. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Company s existing and future secured debt,
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries and are not guaranteed by any of the Company s subsidiaries.
The Company may, at its option, prior to July 31, 2017, redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part upon the payment of 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes being redeemed plus any additional amount required by the Indenture. In
addition, the Company may from time to time redeem up to 35% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes before July 31, 2017 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 108.125% of
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Company sells certain of its assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, as defined, it must offer to redeem the Senior Notes. The Company may, at its option, at any time
and from time to time, on or after July 31, 2017, redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part. The Senior Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price initially equal to 106.094% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes (and which declines each
year on July 31) plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On and after any redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redeemed Senior Notes.  
  The Indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit the Company s ability to make certain payments, to pay dividends
and to incur additional indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness would cause the company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Indenture, to be below 2.0 to 1.0. The Senior Notes are listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol  GFNSL.      Other   
  At September 30, 2016, other debt totaled $10,240,000.

   The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under all its credit
facilities as of September 30, 2016.    The weighted-average interest rate in the Asia-Pacific area was 5.5% and 5.0% in FY 2016 and FY
2017, respectively; which does not include the effect of translation, interest rate swap contracts and options and the amortization of deferred financing costs. The weighted-average interest rate in North America was 4.9% in both FY 2016 and FY
2017, respectively, which does not include the effect of the amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest.     Note 6. Financial
Instruments       Fair Value Measurements   
  FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:  
  Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
  Level 2 - Observable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  
  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.     The Company s derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange; therefore, the fair values are
determined using valuation models that include assumptions about yield curve at the reporting dates as well as counter-party credit risk. The assumptions are generally derived from market-observable data. The Company has consistently applied these
calculation techniques to all periods presented, which are considered Level 2. Derivative instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the consolidated balances sheets and statements of operations are as follows (in
thousands):

Interest Rate Swap Contracts   
  The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its senior and other debt obligations. The
Company s policy is to manage its interest expense by using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.     To manage its exposure to
variable interest rates in a cost-efficient manner, the Company enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate options, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These swaps and options are designated to hedge changes in the interest rate of a portion of the outstanding borrowings in the Asia-Pacific area. In August 2012, the Company
entered into an interest swap contract that was designated as a cash flow hedge. This cash flow hedge was determined to be highly effective and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the effective portion were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. The Company expects this derivative to remain effective during the term of the swap; however, any changes in the portion of the hedge considered ineffective would be recorded in interest expense in the consolidated
statement of operations. There was no ineffective portion recorded in FY 2016 and FY 2017.

   The Company s interest rate derivative instruments are not traded on a market
exchange; therefore, the fair values are determined using valuation models which include assumptions about the interest rate yield curve at the reporting dates (Level 2 fair value measurement). As of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, there
was one open interest rate swap contract that was designated as a cash flow hedge and matures in June 2017, as follows (dollars in thousands):      
    Foreign Currency Risk   
  The Company has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the functional
currency. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily U.S. dollars. Royal Wolf has a bank account denominated in U.S. dollars into which a small number of customers pay their debts. This is a natural hedge against fluctuations in the
exchange rate. The funds are then used to pay suppliers, avoiding the need to convert to Australian dollars. Royal Wolf uses forward currency and participating forward contracts to eliminate the currency exposures on the majority of its
transactions denominated in foreign currencies, either by transaction if the amount is significant, or on a general cash flow hedge basis. The forward currency and participating forward contracts are always in the same currency as the hedged item.
The Company believes that financial instruments designated as foreign currency hedges are highly effective. However documentation of such as required by ASC Topic 815 does not exist. Therefore, all movements in the fair values of these hedges are
reported in the statement of operations in the period in which fair values change. As of June 30, 2016, there were 49 open forward exchange contracts that mature between July 2016 and November 2016; and as of September 30, 2016, there were 28
open forward exchange contracts that mature between October 2016 and December 2016, as follows (dollars in thousands):      
    In FY 2016 and FY 2017, net unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains (losses) totaled $(654,000)
and $5,000 and $(153,000) and $(17,000), respectively.    Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments   
  The fair value of the Company s borrowings under the Senior Notes was determined based on a Level 1 input and for borrowings under
its senior credit facilities and Credit Suisse Term Loan determined based on Level 3 inputs; including a comparison to a group of comparable industry debt issuances ( Industry Comparable Debt Issuances ) and a study of credit ( Credit
Spread Analysis ). Under the Industry Comparable Debt Issuance method, the Company compared the debt facilities to several industry comparable debt issuances. This method consisted of an analysis of the offering yields compared to the
current yields on publicly traded debt securities. Under the Credit Spread Analysis, the Company first examined the implied credit spreads of the United States Federal Reserve. Based on this analysis the Company was able to assess the credit market.
The fair value of the Company s senior credit facilities as of June 30, 2016 was determined to be approximately $336,901,000. The Company also determined that the fair value of its other debt of $8,818,000 at June 30, 2016, approximated or
would not vary significantly from their carrying values. The Company believes that market conditions at September 30, 2016 have not changed significantly from June 30, 2016. Therefore, the proportion of the fair value to the carrying value
of the Company s senior credit facilities and other debt at September 30, 2016 would not vary significantly from the proportion determined at June 30, 2016.

  Note 7. Related-Party Transactions   
  Effective January 31, 2008, the Company entered into a lease with an affiliate of the Company s chief executive officer for its
corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. The rent is $7,393 per month, effective March 1, 2009, plus allocated charges for common area maintenance, real property taxes and insurance, for approximately 3,000 square feet of office space. The
term of the lease is five years, with two five-year renewal options, and the rent is adjusted yearly based on the consumer price index. On October 11, 2012, the Company exercised its option to renew the lease for an additional five-year term
commencing February 1, 2013. Rental payments were $28,000 in both FY 2016 and FY 2017.    The premises of Pac-Van s Las Vegas
branch is owned by and leased from the acting branch manager through December 31, 2014, with the right for an additional two-year extension through December 31, 2016. On December 29, 2014, the Company extended the lease for the additional two
years. Rental payments on this lease totaled $30,000 during both FY 2016 and FY 2017.     Note 8. Equity Plans   
  On September 11, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ), which
was approved by the stockholders at the Company s annual meeting on December 4, 2014 and amended and restated by the stockholders at the annual meeting on December 3, 2015. The 2014 Plan is an  omnibus  incentive plan permitting a
variety of equity programs designed to provide flexibility in implementing equity and cash awards, including incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock grants ( non-vested equity shares ), restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, performance stock, performance units and other stock-based awards. Participants in the 2014 Plan may be granted any one of the equity awards or any combination of them, as determined by the Board of Directors or the
Compensation Committee. Upon the approval of the 2014 Plan by the stockholders, the Company suspended further grants under its previous equity plans, the General Finance Corporation 2006 Stock Option Plan (the  2006 Plan ) and the 2009
Stock Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ) (collectively the  Predecessor Plans ), which had a total of 2,500,000 shares reserved for grant. Any stock options which are forfeited under the Predecessor Plans will become available for
grant under the 2014 Plan, but the total number of shares available under the 2014 Plan will not exceed the 1,500,000 shares reserved for grant under the 2014 Plan, plus any options which were forfeited or are available for grant under the
Predecessor Plans. If not sooner terminated by the Board of Directors, the 2014 Plan will expire on December 4, 2024, which is the tenth anniversary of the date it was approved by the Company s stockholders. The 2006 Plan expired on June 30,
2016 and the 2009 Plan will expire on December 10, 2019. The Predecessor Plans and the 2014 Plan are referred to collectively as the  Stock Incentive Plan.  
 There have been no grants or awards of restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock or performance units under the
Stock Incentive Plan. All grants to-date consist of incentive and non-qualified stock options that vest over a period of up to five years ( time-based ), non-qualified stock options that vest over varying periods that are dependent on the
attainment of certain defined EBITDA and other targets ( performance-based ) and non-vested equity shares. At September 30, 2016, 1,047,610 shares remained available for grant.  
 Since inception, the range of the fair value of the stock options granted (other than to non-employee consultants) and the assumptions used
are as follows:

  At September 30, 2016, there were no significant outstanding stock options held by
non-employee consultants that were not fully vested. A summary of the Company s stock option activity and related information for FY 2017 follows:      
    At September 30, 2016, outstanding time-based options and performance-based options totaled 1,184,847
and 768,710, respectively. Also at that date, the Company s market price for its common stock was $4.50 per share, which was below the exercise prices of approximately 54% of the outstanding stock options. The intrinsic value of the outstanding
stock options at that date was $1,566,000. Share-based compensation of $6,773,000 related to stock options has been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding benefit to equity, from inception through September 30,
2016. At that date, there remains $969,000 of unrecognized compensation expense to be recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.9 years. 
  A deduction is not allowed for U.S. income tax purposes with respect to non-qualified options granted in the United States until the
stock options are exercised or, with respect to incentive stock options issued in the United States, unless the optionee makes a disqualifying disposition of the underlying shares. The amount of any deduction will be the difference between the fair
value of the Company s common stock and the exercise price at the date of exercise. Accordingly, there is a deferred tax asset recorded for the U.S. tax effect of the financial statement expense recorded related to stock option grants in the
United States. The tax effect of the U.S. income tax deduction in excess of the financial statement expense, if any, will be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.  
  A summary of the Company s non-vested equity share activity follows:  
   
   Share-based compensation of $1,648,000 related to non-vested equity shares has been recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding benefit to equity, from inception through September 30, 2016. At that date, there remains $822,000 of unrecognized compensation expense to be recorded on a straight-line basis over the
remaining vesting period of over approximately 0.24 years   2.75 years for the non-vested equity shares.

   Royal Wolf Long Term Incentive Plan   
  Royal Wolf established the Royal Wolf Long Term Incentive Plan (the  LTI Plan ) in conjunction with its initial public
offering in May 2011. Under the LTI Plan, the RWH Board of Directors may grant, at its discretion, options, performance rights and/or restricted shares of RWH capital stock to Royal Wolf employees and executive directors. Vesting terms and
conditions may be up to four years and, generally, will be subject to performance criteria based primarily on enhancing shareholder returns using a number of key financial benchmarks, including EBITDA. In addition, unless the RWH Board determines
otherwise, if an option, performance right or restricted share has not lapsed or been forfeited earlier, it will terminate at the seventh anniversary from the date of grant.  
  It is intended that up to one percent of RWH s outstanding capital stock will be reserved for grant under the LTI Plan and a trust
will be established to hold RWH shares for this purpose. However, so long as the Company holds more than 50% of the outstanding shares of RWH capital stock, RWH shares reserved for grant under the LTI Plan are required to be purchased in the open
market unless the Company agrees otherwise. The LTI Plan, among other provisions, does not permit the transfer, sale, mortgage or encumbering of options, performance rights and restricted shares without the prior approval of the RWH Board. In the
event of a change of control, the RWH Board, at its discretion, will determine whether, and how many, unvested options, performance rights and restricted shares will vest. In addition, if, in the RWH Board s opinion, a participant acts
fraudulently or dishonestly or is in breach of his obligations to Royal Wolf, the RWH Board may deem any options, performance rights and restricted shares held by or reserved for the participant to have lapsed or been forfeited.  
  As of September 30, 2016, Royal Wolf has granted, net of forfeitures, 1,288,841 performance rights to key management personnel under the
LTI Plan. Also, as of September 30, 2016, 642,582 of the performance rights have been converted into RWH capital stock through purchases in the open market. In FY 2016 and FY 2017, share-based compensation of $131,000 and $(716,000), respectively,
related to the LTI Plan has been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding offset to equity.     Note 9. Commitments
and Contingencies      The Company is not involved in any material lawsuits or claims arising out of the normal course of business.
The nature of its business is such that disputes can occasionally arise with employees, vendors (including suppliers and subcontractors) and customers over warranties, contract specifications and contract interpretations among other things. The
Company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise. Reserves are established, as required, based on its assessment of its exposure. The Company has insurance policies to cover general liability and workers compensation-related
claims. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance under pending litigation and claims, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.

and it would be impractical to collect and maintain financial data in such a manner. In managing the Company s business, senior management focuses on primarily growing its leasing revenues and operating cash flow (EBITDA), and investing in its
lease fleet through capital purchases and acquisitions.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)       

    Intersegment net revenues from Southern Frac to the North American leasing operations totaled $28,000
and $557,000 during FY 2016 and FY 2017, respectively.    Note 12. Subsequent Events   
  On October 14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $2.30 per share on the Series C
Preferred Stock (see Note 3). The dividend is for the period commencing on July 31, 2016 through October 30, 2016, and is payable on October 31, 2016 to holders of record as of October 30, 2016.  
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, an appraisal performed under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility reduced the estimated orderly liquidation
value of the lease fleet, particularly mobile offices and modular buildings, used as collateral for the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, and the availability to borrow under this facility was reduced to approximately $2,200,000 at October 28,
2016. Senior management believes that future steps to be taken by the Company to manage its business and working with Wells Fargo will increase the amount of borrowing availability.

  Overview      Founded in October 2005,
we are a leading specialty rental services company offering portable (or mobile) storage, modular space and liquid containment solutions in these three distinct, but related industries, which we collectively refer to as the  portable services
industry.      We have two geographic areas that include four operating segments; the Asia-Pacific (or Pan-Pacific) area,
consisting of Royal Wolf (which leases and sells storage containers, portable container buildings and freight containers in Australia and New Zealand) and North America, consisting of Pac-Van (which leases and sells storage, office and portable
liquid storage tank containers, modular buildings and mobile offices), and Lone Star (see above), which are combined to form our  North American Leasing  operations, and Southern Frac (which manufactures portable liquid storage tank
containers). As of September 30, 2016, our two geographic leasing operations lease and sell their products through twenty-two customer service centers ( CSCs ) in Australia, ten CSCs in New Zealand, fifty branch locations in the
United States and three branch locations in Canada. At that date, we had 254 and 517 employees and 41,486 and 38,165 lease fleet units in the Asia-Pacific area and North America, respectively. 
  Our lease fleet is comprised of three distinct specialty rental equipment categories that possess attractive asset characteristics and
serve our customers  on-site temporary needs and applications. These categories match the sectors comprising the portable services industry.  
  Our portable storage category is segmented into two products: (1) storage containers, which primarily consist of new and used steel
shipping containers under International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) standards, that provide a flexible, low cost alternative to warehousing, while offering greater security, convenience and immediate accessibility; and
(2) freight containers, which are either designed for transport of products by road and rail and are only offered in our Asia-Pacific territory. 
  Our modular space category is segmented into three products: (1) office containers, which are referred to as portable container
buildings in the Asia-Pacific, are either modified or specifically manufactured containers that provide self-contained office space with maximum design flexibility. Office containers in the United States are oftentimes referred to as ground level
offices ( GLOs  (2) modular buildings, which provide customers with flexible space solutions and are often modified to customer specifications and (3) mobile offices, which are re-locatable units with aluminum or wood exteriors
and wood (or steel) frames on a steel carriage fitted with axles, and which allow for an assortment of  add-ons  to provide convenient temporary space solutions.  
  Our liquid containment category includes portable liquid storage tanks that are manufactured 500-barrel capacity steel containers with
fixed axles for transport. These units are regularly utilized for a variety of applications across a

  Results of Operations      Quarter Ended September 30,
2016 ( FY 2017 ) Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2015 ( FY 2016 )      The following
compares our FY 2017 results of operations with our FY 2016 results of operations.  
   Revenues.     Revenues decreased $1.0 million, or 2%, to $62.8 million in FY 2017 from
$63.8 million in FY 2016. This consisted of a $0.5 million increase, or 1%, in revenues in our North American leasing operations, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 2%, in revenues in the Asia-Pacific area and a decrease of
$1.0 million in manufacturing revenues from Southern Frac. The effect of the average currency exchange rate of the stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in FY 2017 versus FY 2016 enhanced the translation of revenues from
the Asia-Pacific area. The average currency exchange rate of one Australian dollar during FY 2017 was $0.75828 U.S. dollar compared to $0.7270 U.S. dollar during FY 2016. In Australian dollars, total revenues in the Asia-Pacific area
decreased by 4% in FY 2017 from FY 2016.     Excluding Lone Star (doing business solely in the oil and gas sector),
total revenues of our North American leasing operations increased by $3.7 million in FY 2017 from FY 2016, primarily in the commercial, industrial, construction and government sectors, which increased by an aggregate $7.2 million; and was
partially offset by reductions in the retail, energy (oil and gas and mining) and services sectors totaling $3.5 million. At Lone Star, revenues declined by $3.2 million, or 46%, from $7.0 million in FY 2016 to $3.8 million in FY
2016. The revenue decrease in the Asia-Pacific area occurred primarily in the energy and retail sectors, which decreased between the periods by $0.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million in the consumer sector.
Revenues were impacted by an approximate 4% favorable foreign exchange translation effect between periods.     Sales
and leasing revenues represented 33% and 67% of total non-manufacturing revenues, respectively, in both FY 2017 and FY 2016. 
  Sales during FY 2017 amounted to $21.5 million, compared to $22.5 million during FY 2016; representing a
decrease of $1.0 million, or 4%. This consisted of a $1.2 million decrease, or approximately 11%, in sales in the Asia-Pacific area, an increase of $1.2 million, or 13%, in our North American leasing operations and a decrease in
manufacturing sales of $1.0 million, or 48%, at Southern Frac. Overall, non-manufacturing sales were comparable in FY 2017 with FY 2016. The decrease in the Asia-Pacific area was comprised of a decrease of $0.9 million
($0.2 million decrease due to lower unit sales, $0.9 million decrease due to lower average prices and a $0.2 million increase due to foreign exchange movements) in the CSC operations and a decrease of $0.3 million due to lower
unit sales in the national accounts group, and occurred primarily in the building and construction, government, retail and transportation sectors, which decreased between the periods by $1.6 million; partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million
in the consumer sector. In our North American leasing operations, the sales increase in FY 2017 from FY 2016 was primarily in the commercial, industrial, government and construction sectors, which totaled $3.5 million; offset somewhat by
decreases in the services, retail and energy sectors totaling $2.3 million. The decrease at Southern Frac was due to the continued low demand for our portable liquid containment tanks caused by soft oil and gas drilling activity, primarily
in Texas.     Leasing revenues totaled $41.3 million in both FY 2017 and FY 2016. This consisted of a
decrease of $0.6 million, or 2%, in North America, and an increase of $0.6 million, or approximately 5%, in the Asia-Pacific area. In Australian dollars, leasing revenues increased by 2% in the Asia-Pacific area in FY 2017 from FY
2016.     In the Asia-Pacific area, average utilization in the retail and the national accounts group operations was
82% and 60%, respectively, during FY 2017, as compared to 84% and 59% in FY 2016. The overall average utilization decreased slightly to 77% in FY 2017 from 78% in FY 2016; and the average monthly lease rate of containers was AUS$159 in FY 2017
versus AUS$164 in FY 2016. Leasing revenues in FY 2017 decreased in Australian dollars from FY 2016 due to the combination of a lower composite monthly lease rate, caused primarily by a lower average lease rate in portable container
buildings between the periods, and the average monthly number of units on lease being approximately 200 lower in FY 2017 as compared to FY 2016.  
  In our North American leasing operations, average utilization rates were 71%, 79%, 39%, 77% and 81% and average monthly
lease rates were $121, $307, $473, $284 and $785 for storage containers, office containers, frac tank containers, mobile offices and modular units, respectively, during FY 2017; as compared to 73%, 81%, 48%, 76% and 80% and average monthly lease
rates were $115, $321, $821, $274 and $783 for storage containers, office containers, frac tank containers, mobile offices and modular units in FY 2016, respectively. The average composite utilization rate decreased to 70% in FY 2017 from 73%
in FY 2016; however, the composite average monthly number of units on lease  
      24  

Table of Contents  

was over 3,500 higher in FY 2017 as compared to FY 2016. The increased average monthly number of units on lease and higher monthly lease rates, other than office and frac tank containers,
between the years resulted from improved demand in most sectors, but was more than offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in the energy sectors, primarily at Lone Star, while all other sectors increased by $3.3 million.  
   Cost of Sales.   Cost of sales from our lease inventories and fleet (which is the cost related to our sales revenues
only and exclusive of the line items discussed below) decreased by $0.7 million from $14.5 million during FY 2016 to $13.8 million during FY 2017, and our gross profit percentage from these non-manufacturing sales improved to 32% in
FY 2017 from approximately 29% in FY 2016. Cost of sales from our manufactured products totaled $1.4 million in FY 2017, as compared to $2.8 million in FY 2016, resulting in reducing our gross margin loss from $0.7 million in FY 2016
to $0.3 million in FY 2017. The loss incurred during both periods was due primarily to the lack of volume of tank sales and, though improved between the periods, production inefficiencies from our other steel-based products, primarily
chassis. We remain focused on making our chassis and other steel-based products commercially viable in order to diversify outside of our core portable liquid containment business.  
   Direct Costs of Leasing Operations and Selling and General Expenses.     Direct costs of leasing operations and
selling and general expenses increased by $1.1 million from $33.3 million during FY 2016 to $34.4 million during FY 2017. As a percentage of revenues, these costs increased to 55% during FY 2017 from 52% in FY 2016 due to
operating expenses in our North American operations not proportionately decreasing with lower revenues, primarily as a result of the adverse effect of lower lease and utilization rates between the periods from the continuing soft oil and gas market,
primarily in our North American leasing operations.      Depreciation and
Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.4 million to $9.5 million in FY 2017 from $9.1 million in FY 2016. This consisted of an increase of $0.3 million in the Asia-Pacific area and
a $0.1 million increase in North America, primarily as a result of our increased investment in the lease fleet and business acquisitions.  
   Interest Expense .  Interest expense of $4.8 million in FY 2017 was $0.2 million lower than
the $5.0 million in FY 2016, consisting of a decrease of $0.3 million in the Asia-Pacific area and a $0.1 million increase in North America. In the Asia-Pacific area, reduced interest expense was due to the weighted-average
interest rate of 5.0% (which does not include the effect of translation, interest rate swap contracts and options and the amortization of deferred financing costs) in FY 2017 being lower than the 5.5% in FY 2016, as well as average borrowings
being comparatively lower between the periods. However, this was partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar between the periods. In North America, the higher interest expense was due to the higher average borrowings in FY 2017, as
compared to FY 2016, since the weighted-average interest rate of 4.9% (which does not include the effect of the accretion of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs) was the same for both periods.  
   Foreign Currency Exchange and Other .  The currency exchange rate of one Australian dollar to one U.S. dollar was
$0.7658 at June 30, 2015, $0.6978 at September 30, 2015, $0.74425 at June 30, 2016 and $0.76358 at September 30, 2016. In FY 2016 and FY 2017, net unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains (losses) totaled $(654,000) and $5,000 and
$(153,000) and $(17,000), respectively. In addition, in FY 2016 and FY 2017, unrealized exchange gains on forward exchange contracts totaled $762,000 and $81,000, respectively.  
   Income Taxes.     Our effective income tax rate was 40.0% in FY 2017 and FY 2016. The
effective rate is greater than the U.S. federal rate of 35% primarily because of state income taxes from the filing of tax returns in multiple U.S. states and the effect of doing business and filing income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions.  
   Preferred Stock Dividends.     In both FY 2017 and FY 2016, we paid $0.9 million primarily on
our 9.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the  Series C Preferred Stock ).  
   Noncontrolling Interests.     Noncontrolling interests in the Royal Wolf and Southern Frac results
of operations were approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million in FY 2017 and FY 2016, respectively, a slight decrease of $0.1 million.  
   Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders.     Net loss attributable to common stockholders was
$2.1 million in FY 2017 and $2.0 million in FY 2016, a slight increase of $0.1 million.

   Measures not in Accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( U.S.
GAAP )      Earnings before interest, income taxes, impairment, depreciation and amortization and other non-operating costs and
income ( EBITDA ) and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and
should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of
liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. We calculate adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. You are encouraged to evaluate each
adjustment and whether you consider each to be appropriate. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the expenses excluded from our presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Our
presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our
performance and because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, many of which present EBITDA and a form of adjusted EBITDA when reporting their
results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only
supplementally. The following table shows our adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from net income (in thousands):      
    Our business is capital intensive, so from an operating level we focus primarily on EBITDA and adjusted
EBITDA to measure our results. These measures provide us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and fleet growth objectives. In managing our business, we regularly compare our adjusted EBITDA
margins on a monthly basis. As capital is invested in our established branch (or CSC) locations, we achieve higher adjusted EBITDA margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch, because our fixed costs are
already in place in connection with the established branches. The fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment, as well as advertising, sales, marketing and office expenses. With a new market or branch, we must first fund and
absorb the start-up costs for setting up the new branch facility, hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs. A new branch will have low adjusted EBITDA margins in its early years until
the number of units on rent increases. Because of our higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue, which we realize on a branch-by-branch basis, when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs,
leasing revenues in excess of the break-even amount produce large increases in profitability and adjusted EBITDA margins. Conversely, absent significant growth in leasing revenues, the adjusted EBITDA margin at a branch will remain relatively flat
on a period by period comparative basis.     Liquidity and Financial Condition   
  Though we have raised capital at the corporate level to primarily assist in the funding of acquisitions and lease fleet expenditures, as
well as for general purposes, our operating units substantially fund their operations through secured bank credit facilities that require compliance with various covenants. These covenants require our operating units to, among other things; maintain
certain levels of interest or fixed charge coverage, EBITDA (as defined), utilization rate and overall leverage.     Asia-Pacific Leasing Senior Credit
Facility      Royal Wolf has a $133,627,000 (AUS$175,000,000) secured senior credit facility, as amended, under a common terms deed
arrangement with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ( ANZ ) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA ) (the  ANZ/CBA Credit Facility ). Under the common deed arrangement of the ANZ/CBA
 
      26  

Table of Contents  

Credit Facility, ANZ s proportionate share of the borrowing capacity is 80,176,000 (AUS$105,000,000) and CBA s proportionate share is $53,451,000 (AUS$70,000,000). The ANZ/CBA
Credit Facility has $95,448,000 (AUS$125,000,000) maturing on July 31, 2017 (Facility A), and $38,179,000 (AUS$50,000,000) maturing on July 31, 2019 (Facility B). 
  North America Senior Credit Facility   
  Our North America leasing (Pac-Van and Lone Star) and manufacturing operations (Southern Frac) have a combined $232,000,000 senior
secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with a syndicate led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ) that also includes HSBC Bank USA, NA, the Private Bank and Trust Company, Capital One Business Credit Corp. and
OneWest Bank N.A. (the  Wells Fargo Credit Facility ). The Wells Fargo Credit Facility, which matures on September 7, 2017, effectively not only finances the Company s North American operations, but also the funding requirements
for the Series C Preferred Stock, the term loan with Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch ( Credit Suisse ) and the publicly-traded unsecured senior notes (see below). 
  The Wells Fargo Credit Facility includes a $20,000,000 real estate sub-facility to allow the borrowers (including GFNRC) to acquire real
estate as collateral. In addition, subject to certain conditions, the amount that may be borrowed under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility may increase by $20,000,000 to a maximum of $252,000,000. The maximum amount of intercompany dividends
that Pac-Van and Lone Star are allowed to pay in each fiscal year to GFN for the funding requirements of GFN s senior and other debt and the Series C Preferred Stock are (a) the lesser of $5,000,000 for the Series C Preferred Stock or the
amount equal to the dividend rate of the Series C Preferred Stock and its aggregate liquidation preference and the actual amount of dividends required to be paid to the Series C Preferred Stock; (b) the lesser of $3,125,000 for the term loan with
Credit Suisse or the actual annual interest to be paid; and (c) $6,120,000 for the public offering of unsecured senior notes or the actual amount of annual interest required to be paid; provided that (i) the payment of such dividends does not
cause a default or event of default; (ii) each of Pac-Van and Lone Star is solvent; (iii) excess availability, as defined, is $5,000,000 or more under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility; (iv) the fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, will be
greater than 1.25 to 1.00; and (v) the dividends are paid no earlier than ten business days prior to the date they are due.     Corporate Senior and Other
Debt       Credit Suisse Term Loan   
  On March 31, 2014, we entered into a $25,000,000 facility agreement, as amended, with Credit Suisse ( Credit Suisse Term
Loan ) as part of the financing for the acquisition of Lone Star and, on April 3, 2014, we borrowed the $25,000,000 available to it. Since that time we have prepaid $15,000,000 of the initial borrowings, and $9,898,000 remained outstanding
at September 30, 2016, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $102,000. The Credit Suisse Term Loan provides that the amount borrowed will bear interest at LIBOR plus 7.50% per year, will be payable quarterly and that it will mature on July
1, 2017. In addition, the Credit Suisse Term Loan is secured by a first ranking pledge over substantially all shares of RWH owned by GFN U.S., requires a certain coverage maintenance ratio in U.S. dollars based on the value of the RWH shares
and, among other things, that an amount equal to six-months interest be deposited in an interest reserve account pledged to secure repayment of all amounts borrowed. 
   Senior Notes   
  We have outstanding publicly-traded senior notes (the  Senior Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of $72,000,000
($70,000,000, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2,000,000 at September 30, 2016). The Senior Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof and pursuant to the First Supplemental
Indenture (the  First Supplemental Indenture ) dated as of June 18, 2014 by and between us and Wells Fargo, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The First Supplemental Indenture supplements the Indenture entered into by and between us and
the Trustee dated as of June 18, 2014 (the  Base Indenture  and, together with the First Supplemental Indenture, the  Indenture ). The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.125% per annum, mature on July 31, 2021 and
are not subject to any sinking fund. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31, commencing on July 31, 2014.  
  The Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of
payment to all of its existing and future subordinated debt. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The Senior Notes are structurally
subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries.

   As of September 30, 2016, our required principal and other obligations payments for the
twelve months ending September 30, 2017 and the subsequent three twelve-month periods are as follows (in thousands):      
    We have commenced the process of refinancing or extending our North America Senior Credit Facility and
Facility A of our Asia-Pacific Leasing Senior Credit Facility due September 2017 and July 2017, respectively. While we believe that we have strong relationships with our senior lenders and that such refinancing or extension will be consummated
prior to the respective due dates, there is no assurance that such consummation will be made under comparable or favorable terms. Reference is made to Notes 5 and 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of our senior and other debt.     We currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock and do not intend on doing so in the
foreseeable future.     Capital Deployment and Cash Management   
  Our business is capital intensive, and we acquire leasing assets before they generate revenues, cash flow and earnings. These leasing
assets have long useful lives and require relatively minimal maintenance expenditures. Most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically, to increase the number of units
available for lease at our branch and CSC locations and to add to the breadth of our product mix. Our operations have generally generated annual cash flow which would include, even in profitable periods, the deferral of income taxes caused by
accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting.    As we discussed above, our principal source of capital for operations
consists of funds available from the senior secured credit facilities at our operating units. We also finance a smaller portion of capital requirements through finance leases and lease-purchase contracts. We intend to continue utilizing our
operating cash flow and net borrowing capacity primarily to expanding our container sale inventory and lease fleet through both capital expenditures and accretive acquisitions; as well as paying dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and 8.00%
Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Series B Preferred Stock ), if and when declared by our Board of Directors. While we own a majority interest of Royal Wolf and its results and accounts are included in our consolidated financial
statements, access to its operating cash flows, cash on hand and other financial assets and the borrowing capacity under its senior credit facility are limited to us in North America contractually by its senior lenders and, to a certain extent, as a
result of Royal Wolf being a public reporting entity on the Australian Stock Exchange.    Reference is made to Note 12 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent developments.     Supplemental information pertaining to our
consolidated sources and uses of cash is presented in the table below (in thousands):      
    Cash Flow for FY 2017 Compared to FY 2016   
   Operating activities.  Our operations used cash of $0.4 million during FY 2017 versus providing cash of $14.1 million
during FY 2016, a decrease of $14.5 million. While the net loss of 0.7 million in FY 2017 was not significantly different from the $0.5 million in FY 2016, our management of operating assets and liabilities in FY 2017, when compared
to FY 2016, reduced operating cash flows by $15.7 million. The primary reason for this was the timing on the satisfaction of trade payables, accrued liabilities and unearned revenues during FY 2017 that, when compared to FY 2016, reduced
operating cash flows by $18.6 million between the periods. In FY 2017 these operating liabilities  
      28  

Table of Contents  

reduced cash flow by $3.3 million, whereas in FY 2016 they increased cash flow by $15.3 million. Historically, we have experienced significant variations in operating assets and liabilities
between periods when conducting our business in due course. For the quarters ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, trade payables, accrued liabilities and unearned revenues enhanced (decreased) operating cash flows by $(1.8 million), $16.2
million and $(6.4 million), respectively. Non-cash adjustments relating to depreciation, amortization (including amortization of deferred financing costs) and accretion of interest of $10.1 million in FY 2017 and $9.8 million in FY 2016 increased
operating cash flows between the periods by $0.3 million. However, operating cash flows were reduced between the periods by $0.7 million from non-cash adjustments for deferred income taxes. In FY 2017 and FY 2016, deferred income taxes reduced
operating cash flows by $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively. In FY 2017, operating cash flows were increased by a loss of $0.5 million on the sales of lease fleet, whereas in FY 2016 it was reduced by a gain of $2.1 million. Additionally,
operating cash flows were reduced by non-cash share-based compensation of $0.4 million in FY 2017 and enhanced by $0.6 million in FY 2016. Typically, share-based compensation is an add-back to operating cash flows, but in FY 2017 a benefit of $0.7
million was recorded at Royal Wolf, primarily for the reversal of expenses recognized for unvested performance grants to key employees under its Long Term Incentive Plan (see Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  
   Investing Activities.  Net cash used in investing activities was $9.5 million during FY 2017, as compared to $9.3 million used
during FY 2016, a slight increase of $0.2 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment (or rolling stock) were $0.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.1 million in FY 2016, a decrease of $0.3 million. In both periods, proceeds from sales of property,
plant and equipment were not significant. Net capital expenditures of lease fleet (purchases, net of proceeds from sales of lease fleet) were $6.7 million in FY 2017 as compared to $7.6 million in FY 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million. In FY 2017, net
capital expenditures of lease fleet were approximately $4.4 million in North America, as compared to $5.9 million in FY 2016, a decrease of $1.5 million, and net capital expenditures of lease fleet in the Pan Pacific totaled $2.3 million in FY 2017,
versus $1.7 million in FY 2016, an increase of $0.6 million. The amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion and we have no significant long-term contracts or other
arrangements pursuant to which we may be required to purchase at a certain price or a minimum amount of goods or services. In FY 2017, we made two business acquisitions in North America for cash of $2.1 million; as compared to one business
acquisition in North America during FY 2016 for cash totaling $0.7 million (see Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  
  Financing Activities.  Net cash used in financing activities was $10.2 million during FY 2017, as compared to net cash provided of $1.3
million during FY 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million. In FY 2017 and FY 2016, cash provided from financing activities included net borrowings of $11.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, on existing credit facilities to primarily fund our
investment in the container lease fleet and business acquisitions and, in FY 2017, for the management of operating assets and liabilities. Cash was also used during both periods to pay dividends on primarily our Series C Preferred Stock of $0.9
million and, in FY 2016, $0.2 million was used to make a distribution to the noncontrolling interest of Southern Frac.     Asset Management   
 Receivables and inventories were $40.5 million and $38.9 million at September 30, 2016 and $38.1 million and $34.6 million at June 30,
2016, respectively. At September 30, 2016, days sales outstanding ( DSO ) in trade receivables were 39 days and 54 days in the Asia-Pacific area and in our North American leasing operations, as compared to 36 days and 49 days at June 30,
2016, respectively. The higher DSO in our North American leasing operations was primarily due to the longer payment lag by our oil and gas customers. Effective asset management is always a significant focus as we strive to apply appropriate credit
and collection controls and maintain proper inventory levels to enhance cash flow and profitability.    The net book value of our total
lease fleet was $424.2 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $419.3 million at June 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had 79,651 units (22,122 units in retail operations in Australia, 9,476 units in national account group operations
in Australia, 9,888 units in New Zealand, which are considered retail; and 38,165 units in North America) in our lease fleet, as compared to 78,605 units (22,194 units in retail operations in Australia, 9,688 units in national account group
operations in Australia, 9,745 units in New Zealand, which are considered retail; and 36,978 units in North America) at June 30, 2016. At those dates, 59,809 units (18,086 units in retail operations in Australia, 5,935 units in national account
group operations in Australia, 8,639 units in New Zealand, which are considered retail; and 27,149 units in North America); and 57,265 units (17,829 units in retail operations in Australia, 5,816 units in national account group operations in
Australia, 8,218 units in New Zealand, which are considered retail; and 25,402 units in North America) were on lease, respectively.    In
the Asia-Pacific area, the lease fleet was comprised of 34,787 storage and freight containers and 6,699 portable building containers at September 30, 2016; and 35,060 storage and freight containers and 6,567 portable building containers at
June 30, 2016. At those dates, units on lease were comprised of 27,711 storage and freight containers and 4,949 portable building containers; and 27,259 storage and freight containers and 4,604 portable building containers, respectively.  
      29  

Table of Contents  

  In North America, the lease fleet was comprised of 25,080 storage containers ,  3,304 office
containers (GLOs), 4,056 portable liquid storage tank containers, 4,578 mobile offices and 1,147 modular units at September 30, 2016; and 24,084 storage containers ,    3,106 office containers (GLOs), 4,056 portable liquid storage tank
containers, 4,590 mobile offices and 1,142 modular units at June 30, 2016. At those dates, units on lease were comprised of 18,304 storage containers, 2,676 office containers, 1,667 portable liquid storage tank containers, 3,562 mobile offices
and 940 modular units; 17,081 storage containers, 2,394 office containers, 1,501 portable liquid storage tank containers, 3,518 mobile offices and 908 modular units, respectively.  
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments   
 Our material contractual obligations and commitments consist of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities discussed
above and operating leases for facilities and office equipment. We believe that our contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those included in our Annual Report.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We do
not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.     Seasonality   
 Although demand from certain customer segments can be seasonal, our operations as a whole are not seasonal to any significant extent. We
experience a reduction in sales volumes at Royal Wolf during Australia s summer holiday break from mid-December to the end of January, followed by February being a short working day month. However, this reduction in sales typically is
counterbalanced by the increased lease revenues derived from the removals or moving and storage industry, which experiences its seasonal peak of personnel relocations during this same summer holiday break. Demand from some of Pac-Van s
customers can be seasonal, such as in the construction industry, which tends to increase leasing activity in the first and fourth quarters; while customers in the retail industry tend to lease more units in the second quarter. Our business at Lone
Star and Southern Frac, which is significantly derived from the oil and gas industry, may decline in our second quarter months of November and December and our third quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower activity in
parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, customer projects. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of frac tank containers on lease until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves.
    Environmental and Safety     Our
operations, and the operations of many of our customers, are subject to numerous federal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and transportation. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, storm water and the
management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position or results of operations. However, the failure by us to comply with applicable environmental and other requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, remediation actions, and could negatively impact
our reputation with customers. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented a number of measures to promote workplace safety.     Impact of
Inflation     We believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business. However, during periods of rising prices and, in
particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner, which could
harm our future results of operations.     Critical Accounting Estimates   
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we
re-evaluate all of our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
 
      30  

Table of Contents  

the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods.     A comprehensive discussion
of our critical and significant accounting policies and management estimates are included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our Annual Report. Reference is also made to Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our significant accounting policies. We believe there have
been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during FY 2017.     Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements      Reference is made to Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently
issued accounting pronouncements that could potentially impact us.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk     Market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates, foreign exchanges and other market-driven rates or
prices. Exposure to interest rates and currency risks arises in the normal course of our business and we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We believe we have no
material market risks to our operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of derivative activities, including forward-exchange contracts. 
 Reference is made to Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our senior and other debt and
financial instruments.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file
and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in accordance with SEC guidelines and that such information is
communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives and that our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in reaching that level of reasonable assurance.  
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
