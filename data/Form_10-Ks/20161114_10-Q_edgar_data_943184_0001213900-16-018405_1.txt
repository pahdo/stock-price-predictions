NOTE
1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Ever-Glory
International Group, Inc. (the  Company ), together with its subsidiaries, is an apparel manufacturer, supplier and
retailer in The People's Republic of China ( China or  PRC ), with a wholesale segment and a retail segment. The
Company s wholesale business consists of recognized brands for department and specialty stores located in China, Europe,
Japan and the United States. The Company s retail business consists of flagship stores and store-in-stores for the Company s
own-brand products.  

The
Company s wholesale operations are provided primarily through the Company s wholly-owned PRC subsidiaries, Goldenway
Nanjing Garments Co. Ltd. ( Goldenway ), Nanjing Catch-Luck Garments Co. Ltd. ( Catch-Luck ), Nanjing
New-Tailun Garments Co. Ltd ( New-Tailun ), Ever-Glory International Group Apparel Inc.( Ever-Glory Apparel ),
ChuzhouHuirui Garments Co. Ltd. ( Huirui ) and Nanjing Tai Xin Garments Trading Company Limited ( Tai Xin ),
and the Company s wholly-owned Samoa subsidiary, Ever-Glory International Group (HK) Ltd. ( Ever-Glory HK ).  The
Company s retail operations are provided through its wholly- owned subsidiaries, Shanghai LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited
( Shanghai LA GO GO ), Jiangsu LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited ( Jiangsu LA GO GO ), Tianjin LA GO GO
Fashion Company Limited ( Tianjin LA GO GO ), Shanghai YaLan Fashion Company Limited ( YaLan ), Shanghai
Yiduo Fashion Company Limited ( Shanghai Yiduo ) and Xizang He Meida Trading Company Limited ( He Meida ).  

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
(loss), and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they have been condensed and do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  

Wholesale
revenues are generally higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, while retail revenues are generally higher in the first
and fourth fiscal quarters. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

NOTE
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Financial
Instruments   

Management
has estimated that the carrying amounts of non-related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their
short-term maturities. The fair value of amounts due from (to) related parties is not practicable to estimate due to the related
party nature of the underlying transactions.  

Accounts
Receivable   

The
Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing
credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and recorded
based on management s assessment of the credit history of its customers and current relationships with them. The Company
writes off accounts receivable when amounts are deemed uncollectible.  

Fair
Value Accounting   

Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under
ASC 820 are described below:  

Level 1   
      Unadjusted
    quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;   

Level 2   
      Quoted
    prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability;   

Level 3   
      Prices
    or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
    by little or no market activity).   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s financial assets (all Level 1) consist of cash placed with financial institutions that
management considers to be of a high quality.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has a derivative liability subject to recurring fair value measurement (Level 3) with the change
in fair value recognized in earnings (Note 5).  

Foreign
Currency Translation and Other Comprehensive Income   

The
reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of Ever-Glory, Perfect Dream and Ever-Glory HK is
the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of Goldenway, New Tailun, Catch-luck, Ever-Glory Apparel, Shanghai LA GO GO, Jiangsu
LA GO GO, Tianjin LA GO GO, Shanghai Yiduo, YaLan, He Meida, Huirui and Taixin is the Chinese RMB.  

For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the RMB, all assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate at the balance
sheet date; equity was translated at historical rates and items in the statement of income and comprehensive income (loss) were
translated at the average rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income. The resulting translation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. Items in the
cash flow statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.   

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the revenue recognition in  Revenue Recognition
 (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of potential goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. This new standard is now effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption now permitted to the original effective date of December
15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this new standard and the potential impact this standard may have upon adoption.   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations .
The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus
agent considerations. The effective date for this ASU is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers . The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 simplifies
the measurement of certain inventories. Under the new guidance, inventories are required to be measured at the lower of cost and
net realizable value, the latter representing the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, reduced by costs
of completion, disposal, and transportation. Under current guidance, inventories are required to be measured at the lower of cost
or market, but depending upon specific circumstances, market could refer to replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable
value reduced by a normal profit margin. The guidance is to be applied prospectively, is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on
its consolidated financial statements.  

In
September 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16  Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during
the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be
applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application
permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company assessed that there is no significant impact to the
consolidated financial statements on this update.    

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a
lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date. The
ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13   Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   which modifies the
measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated
financial statements. 

The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will
have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE
6 INCOME TAX   

The
Company s operating subsidiaries are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises
and Foreign Enterprises and various local income tax laws ( the Income Tax Laws ).  

All
PRC subsidiaries, except for He Meida, are subject to income tax at the 25% statutory rate.  

He
Meida incorporated in Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region is subject to income tax at 15% statutory rate. The local government has
implemented an income tax reduction from 15% to 9% valid through December 31, 2017.  

Perfect
Dream was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), and under the current laws of the BVI dividends and capital gains
arising from the Company s investments in the BVI are not subject to income taxes.  

Ever-Glory
HK was incorporated in Samoa, and under the current laws of Samoa has no liabilities for income taxes.  

Although
the Company s parent entity is a U.S. entity, the Company s primary operations are through subsidiaries located in
China, certain apparel manufacturing is performed outside of China in Southeast Asia, and sales are made globally. Therefore,
the Company uses significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
In the ordinary course of the Company s business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax
outcome cannot be certain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with the Company s
subsidiaries, potential challenges to nexus, value added estimates, and similar matters. In September 2009, the Company formed
its subsidiary, Ever-Glory HK, domiciled in Samoa, in order to engage in certain limited import and export of apparel, fabric
and accessories, as well as to efficiently address currency exchange matters with international transactions. Over the past few
years, the operational matters handled by this subsidiary have expanded with respect to sub-contracting of certain manufacturing
work outside of China, as well as to other operational matters with non-PRC customers and vendors. Additionally, over this time
period, tax guidance, rules and positions taken by the PRC with respect to transfer pricing issues have evolved, and in certain
cases, become more standardized. As part of the Company s on-going process of evaluating its tax positions, the Company
considered various factors as they relate to its Samoan subsidiary and as related to intercompany transactions. This evaluation
resulted in a change in the Company s estimate of exposure to potential unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties,
and the Company recorded a tax liability of approximately $3.2 million as of December 31, 2013 based on the probability for such
outcomes.  

The
Company and the PRC Tax Bureau have agreed that payments on the tax liability of $3.2 million should be made by the Company
prospectively over the next two to three years period. Approximately $2.3 million had been paid as of September 30, 2016.
Beginning January 1, 2014, all net income generated from Ever-Glory HK has been reported as a taxable income at 25% tax rate
in PRC.    

The
PRC s Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise
in PRC to its immediate holding company outside China; such distributions were exempted under the previous income tax law and
regulations. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the
jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. The foreign invested enterprise became subject to the withholding tax starting from
January 1, 2008. Given that the undistributed profits of the Company's subsidiaries in China are intended to be retained in China
for business development and expansion purposes, no withholding tax accrual has been made.     

After
the tax liability adjustment resulted from the reevaluation of the Company s tax position (resulting in the company allocating substantially
all of the earnings of the Samoan subsidiary to the PRC and reporting such earnings as taxable in the PRC), pre-tax income for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was taxable in the following jurisdictions:  

The
following table reconciles the PRC statutory rates to the Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Income
tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

The
Company has not recorded U.S. deferred income taxes on approximately $81.8 million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries  undistributed
earnings because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. If these earnings were repatriated
to the United States, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes,
as adjusted for foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these earnings
is not practicable.

credit and is to pay annual interest at the rate of 6.0% of amounts provided. As of September 30, 2016 and

and $52.2 million (RMB339 million) (2015) of lines of credit obtained by the Company. Jiangsu Ever-Glory,
ChuzhouHuarui and Nanjing Knitting have also provided their assets as collateral for certain of these lines of credit.
The value of the collateral, as per appraisals obtained by the banks in connection with these lines of credit is

NOTE
10 CONCENTRATIONS AND RISKS   

The
Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the normal course of business and generally does not require collateral.
As a result, management performs ongoing credit evaluations, and the Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses
based upon its loss history and its aging analysis. Based on management s assessment of the amount of probable credit losses,
if any, in existing accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
was $3.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting
period based on a detailed analysis of accounts receivable. In the analysis, management primarily considers the age of the customer s
receivable and also considers the credit worthiness of the customer, the economic conditions in the customer s industry,
and general economic conditions and trends, among other factors. If any of these factors change, the Company may also change its
original estimates, which could impact the level of the Company s future allowance for doubtful accounts.  If
judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivables are incorrect, adjustments to the allowance may be required, which
would reduce profitability.

on Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties,

Overview   

Our
Business   

We
are a retailer of branded fashion apparel and leading global apparel supply chain solution provider based in China. We are listed
on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol of  EVK .  

We
classify our businesses into two segments: Wholesale and Retail. Our wholesale business consists of wholesale-channel sales made
principally to domestically and international recognized brands and department stores located throughout Europe, the U.S., Japan
and the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). We focus on well-known, middle-to-high end casual wear, sportswear,
and outerwear brands. Our retail business consists of retail-channel sales directly to consumers through retail stores located
throughout the PRC as well as sales via online stores at Tmall, Dangdang mall, JD.com, VIP.com and etc.  

Although
we have our own manufacturing facilities, we currently outsource most of the manufacturing to our long-term contractors as part
of our overall business strategy. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our production capacity and maintain flexibility
while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping skilled workers on production lines during low seasons. We oversee
our long-term contractors with our advanced management solutions and inspect products manufactured by them to ensure that they
meet our high quality control standards and timely delivery.  

Wholesale
Business   

We
conduct our original design manufacturing ( ODM ) operations through seven wholly owned subsidiaries which are located
in the Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone and Shang Fang Town in the Jiangning District in Nanjing,
Jiangsu province, China, Chuzhou, Anhui province, China and Samoa: Ever-Glory International Group Apparel Inc. ( Ever-Glory
Apparel ), Goldenway Nanjing Garments Company Limited ( Goldenway ), Nanjing New-Tailun Garments Company Limited
( New Tailun ), Nanjing Catch-Luck Garments Co., Ltd. ( Catch-Luck ), ChuzhouHuirui Garments Co., Ltd.
( Huirui), Nanjing Tai Xin Garments Trading Company Limited ( Tai Xin ) and Ever-Glory International Group (HK)
Ltd. ( Ever-Glory HK ).

Business   

We
conduct our retail operations through Shanghai LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited ( LA GO GO ), Jiangsu LA GO GO Fashion
Company Limited ( Jiangsu LA GO GO ), Tianjin LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited ( Tianjin LA GO GO ), Shanghai
YaLan Fashion Company Limited ( YaLan ), 78% owned subsidiary Shanghai Yiduo Fashion Company Limited ( Shanghai
Yiduo ) and Xizang He Meida Trading Company Limited ( He Meida ).  

Business
Objectives    

Wholesale
Business   

We
believe the enduring strength of our wholesale business is mainly due to our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive
product designs that stand for exceptional styling and quality. We maintain long-term, satisfactory relationships with a portfolio
of well-known and mid-class global brands.  

The
primary business objective for our wholesale segment is to expand our portfolio into higher-class brands, expand our customer
base and improve our profit. We believe that our growth opportunities and continued investment initiatives include:  

Expanding
    our global sourcing network;   

Expanding
    our overseas low-cost manufacturing base (outside of mainland China);   

Focusing
    on high value-added products and continuing our strategy to produce mid-to-high end apparel;   

Continuing
    to emphasize product design and technology utilization;   

Seeking
    strategic acquisitions of international distributors that could enhance global sales and our distribution network; and   

Maintaining
    stable revenue increase in the markets while shifting focus to higher margin wholesale markets such as mainland China.   

Retail
Business   

The
business objectives for our retail segment are to establish leading brands of women s apparel and to build a
nationwide retail network in China. As of September 30, 2016, we had 1,345 stores (including store-in-stores), including 273
stores were opened and 87 stores were closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
believe that our growth opportunities and continued investment initiatives include:  

Building
    our retail brand to be recognized as a major player in the mid-to-high end women s apparel market in China;   

Expanding
    our retail network throughout China;   

Improving
    our retail stores  efficiency and increasing same-store sales;   

Continuing
    to launch retail flagship stores in Tier-1 cities and increasing our penetration and coverage in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities;
    and   

Becoming
    a multi-brand operator.   

Seasonality
of Business    

Our
business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our third and fourth quarters and higher retail
sales in our first and fourth quarters. These trends primarily result from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and holiday
periods in the retail segment.  

Collection
Policy    

Wholesale
business   

For
our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by letters of credit. For our long-term and established customers
with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following the delivery of finished
goods.  

Retail
business   

For
store-in-store shops, we generally receive payments from the stores between 60 to 90 days following the date of the register receipt.
For our own flagship stores, we receive payments on the same day of the register receipt. For sales from e-commerce platforms
such as Tmall, Dangdang mall, JD.com, VIP.com and etc., we generally receive payments between 5 to 15 days following the date
of the register receipt.  

Global
Economic Uncertainty    

Our
business is dependent on consumer demand for our products. We believe that the significant uncertainty in the global economy
and the slowdown of economies in China, the United States and Europe have increased our clients  sensitivity to the
cost of our products. We have experienced continued pricing pressure. If the global economic environment continues to be
weak, these worsening economic conditions could have a negative impact on our sales growth and operating margins in our
wholesale segment in 2016.  

In
addition, economic conditions in China and other foreign markets in which we operate could substantially affect our
sales profitability, cash position and collection of accounts receivable. Global credit and capital markets have experienced
unprecedented volatility and disruption. Business credit and liquidity have tightened in much of the world. Some of our suppliers
and customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems and other financial hardships. These factors currently
have not had an impact on the timeliness of receivable collections from our customers. We cannot predict at this time how
this situation will develop and whether accounts receivable may need to be allowed for or written off in the coming quarters.  

Despite
the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economy, we believe our core strengths will continue to
allow us to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.  

Summary
of Critical Accounting Policies   

We
have identified critical accounting policies that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the
underlying accounting standards and operation involved could result in material changes to our financial position or results of
operations under different conditions or using different assumptions.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize wholesale revenue from product sales, net of value-added taxes, upon delivery for local sales and upon shipment of the
products for export sales, at such time title passes to the customer provided however that (i) there are no uncertainties regarding
customer acceptance (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv)
collectability is deemed probable. We recognize wholesale revenue from manufacturing fees charged to buyers for the assembly of
garments from materials provided by the buyers upon completion of the manufacturing process and shipment of the products for export
sales, provided that (i) there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
(iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectability is deemed probable. Retail sales are recorded net of
promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances. Retail store sales are recognized at the time of the register receipt.
Retail online sales are recognized when products are shipped and customers receive the products because we retain a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit.  

Estimates
and Assumptions   

In
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are
inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to
differ from estimated amounts. Significant estimates in 2016 and 2015 include the assumptions used to value warrants and the estimates
of the allowance for deferred tax assets.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the revenue recognition in  Revenue Recognition
 (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of potential goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. This new standard is now effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption now permitted to the original effective date of December
15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this new standard and the potential impact this standard may have upon adoption.   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations .
The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus
agent considerations. The effective date for this ASU is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers . The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 simplifies
the measurement of certain inventories. Under the new guidance, inventories are required to be measured at the lower of cost and
net realizable value, the latter representing the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, reduced by costs
of completion, disposal, and transportation. Under current guidance, inventories are required to be measured at the lower of cost
or market, but depending upon specific circumstances, market could refer to replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable
value reduced by a normal profit margin. The guidance is to be applied prospectively, is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on
its consolidated financial statements.  

In
September 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16  Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during
the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be
applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application
permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company assessed that there is no significant impact to the
consolidated financial statements on this update.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a
lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date. The
ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13   Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   which modifies the
measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated
financial statements. 

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The table and the
discussion below should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing
elsewhere in this report.  

Revenue   

The
following table sets forth a breakdown of our total sales, by region, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $109.9 million, a 7.3% decrease compared with the three months ended September
30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 3.4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business and a 13.2% decrease
in our retail business.  

Sales
generated from our wholesale business contributed 62.7% or $68.9 million of our total sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016, a 3.4% decrease compared with $71.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in sales in Mainland China, the United Kingdom and Japan, partially offset by anincrease in sales in
Hong Kong, China, Germany, Europe-Other and the United States.   

Sales
generated from our retail business contributed 37.3% or $41.1 million of our total sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016, a 13.2% decrease compared with 39.9% or $47.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in same store sales.  

Costs
and Expenses   

Cost
of Sales and Gross Margin   

Cost
of goods sold includes the direct raw material cost, direct labor cost, and manufacturing overhead including depreciation of production
equipment and rent, consistent with the revenue earned. Cost of goods sold excludes warehousing costs, which historically have
not been significant.  

The
following table sets forth the components of our cost of sales and gross profit both in amounts and as a percentage of total sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Raw
material costs for our wholesale business were 45.7% of our total wholesale business sales in the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared with 46.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower raw material
prices.  

Labor
costs for our wholesale business were 1.9% of our total wholesale business sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared with 2.2% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The marginal decrease was mainly due to a higher number of outsourced
orders in 2016.  

Outsourced
production costs for our wholesale business for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 2.1% to $25.9 million from
$26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Outsourced production costs accounted for 37.6% of our total wholesale
business sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 0.5% increase from the three months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily attributable to higher average employee salaries at our outsourced manufacturing factories.  

Overhead
and other expenses for our wholesale business accounted for 0.2% of our total wholesale business sales for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared with 0.2% of total wholesale business sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Wholesale
business gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.1 million compared with $9.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit accounted for 14.6% of our total wholesale sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared with 13.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly due to a decrease in raw
material costs.  

Production
costs for our retail business were $11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $12.6 million
during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Retail production costs accounted for 27.1% of our total retail sales in
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 26.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was due to higher  discounts on our out-of-season products in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the
same period of the prior year.  

Rent
costs for our retail business for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $10.4 million compared with $12.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Rent costs for our retail business accounted for 25.2% of our total retail sales for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 25.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was
primarily attributable to lower variable rent charged at certain locations.  

Gross
profit in our retail business for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $19.6 million and gross margin was 47.6%. Gross
profit in our retail business for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $22.4 million and gross margin was 47.5%.

30, 2016 was 26.9% compared with 27.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses    

Our
selling expenses consist primarily of local transportation, unloading charges, product inspection charges, salaries for retail
staff and decoration and marketing expenses associated with our retail business.  

Our
general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries, office expense, certain depreciation and amortization charges,
repairs and maintenance, legal and professional fees, warehousing costs and other expenses that are not directly attributable
to our revenues.  

Costs
of our distribution network that are excluded from cost of sales consist of local transportation and unloading charges and product
inspection charges. Accordingly our gross profit amounts may not be comparable to those of other companies who include these amounts
in cost of sales.  

Selling
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 3.5% to $18.5 million from $19.2 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower retail sales and  decreased  store management
expense.   

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 5.7% to $9.8 million from $9.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase of $1.9 million
for bad-debt expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30,
2015.   

Income
from Operations

from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 67.7% to $1.2 million from $3.8 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 accounted for 1.1% of our
total sales, a 2.1% decrease compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of decreased gross profit.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.6 million, a 1.4% increase compared with the same period in 2015.  

Income
Tax Expenses   

Income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.7 million, a decrease of 32% compared to the same period of 2015.
The decrease was primarily due to decreased profits of our business.  

Our
PRC subsidiaries are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises
and various local income tax laws. Each of our consolidated entities files its own separate income tax return.  

All
PRC subsidiaries, except for He Meida, are subject to the 25% income tax rate.  

He
Meida incorporated in Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region is subject to income tax at the 15% statutory rate. The local government
has implemented an income tax reduction from 15% to 9% valid through December 31, 2017.  

Perfect
Dream Limited was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), and under the current laws of BVI dividends and capital gains
arising from the Company s investments in the BVI are not subject to income taxes.  

Ever-Glory
International Group (HK) Ltd was incorporated in Samoa on September 15, 2009, and has no liabilities for income tax.  

Although
the Company s parent entity is a US entity, the Company s primary operations are through subsidiaries located in China,
certain apparel manufacturing is performed outside of China in Southeast Asia, sales are made globally, and the Company has other
subsidiary operations in Hong Kong and Samoa.  Therefore, the Company uses significant judgment to calculate and provide
for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. In the ordinary course of the Company s business,
there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain. Some of these uncertainties arise
as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with the Company s subsidiaries, potential challenges to nexus, value
added estimates, and similar matters.  In September 2009, the Company formed its subsidiary, Ever-Glory Hong Kong, domiciled
in Samoa, in order to engage in certain limited import and export of apparel, fabric and accessories, as well as to efficiently
address currency exchange matters with international transactions. Over the past few years, the operational matters handled
by this subsidiary have expanded with respect to sub-contracting of certain manufacturing work outside of China, as well as to
other operational matters with non-PRC customers and vendors.  Additionally, over this time period, tax guidance, rules
and positions taken by the PRC with respect to transfer pricing issues have evolved, and in certain cases, become more standardized.  As
part of the Company s on-going process of evaluating our tax positions, the Company considered various factors as they relate to
its Samoan subsidiary and as related to intercompany transactions. This evaluation resulted in a change in the Company s
estimate of exposure to potential unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties, and the Company recorded a tax liability
of approximately $3.2 million as of December 31, 2013 based on the probability for such outcomes.  

The
Company and the PRC Tax Bureau have agreed that payments on the tax liability of $3.2 million should be made by the Company prospectively
over the next two to three years period. Approximately $2.3 million has been paid as of September 30, 2016. Beginning January
1, 2014, all net income generated from Ever-Glory HK has been reported as a taxable income at 25% tax rate in PRC.    

Ever-Glory
International Group Inc. was incorporated in the United States and has incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes through
September 30, 2016. The net operating loss carry forwards for the United States income taxes may be available to reduce future
years  taxable income. These carry forwards will expire, if not utilized, through 2035. Management believes that the realization
of the benefits from these losses is uncertain due to our limited operating history and continuing losses for the United States
income tax purposes. Accordingly, we provided a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to zero.  

Net
Income   

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.4 million, an 84.9% decrease compared with the same period in
2015. Our basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.04 and $0.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

Results
of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The table and the
discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere
in this report.  

Revenue   

The
following table sets forth a breakdown of our total sales, by region, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $282.3 million, a decrease of 3.4% from the nine months ended September 30,
2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 9.4% decrease in sales in our retail business partially offset bya 3.6% sales
increase in our wholesale business.  

Sales
generated from our wholesale business contributed 49.3% or $139.2 million of our total sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, an increase of 3.6% compared with $134.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily
attributable to increased sales in Hong Kong, China, Europe-Other and the United States partially offset by decreased sales in
Mainland China, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.   

Sales
generated from our retail business contributed 50.7% or $143.1 million of our total sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, a decrease of 9.4% compared with $157.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to a decrease in same store sales.  

Total
retail store square footage and sales per square foot for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

Same-store
sales and newly opened store sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

*Primarily
sales from stores that were closed in the current reporting period.  

We
remodeled or relocated 216 stores in 2015, and 168 stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.We plan to relocate
or remodel an aggregate of 150-200 stores in 2016. Remodels and relocations typically drive incremental same-store sales growth.
A relocation typically results in an improved, more visible and accessible location, and usually includes increased square footage.
We believe we will continue to have opportunities for additional remodels and relocations beyond 2016.  Same-store sales
are calculated based upon stores that were open at least 12 full fiscal months in each reporting period and remain open at the
end of each reporting period.

Our diluted earnings per share were $0.23 and $0.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Summary
of Cash Flows   

Summary
cash flows information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $12.7
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to decrease in inventory as we
control and maintain inventory at the lowest possible level.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $10.8 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was mainly due to the purchase of land use right for our retail logistics
center in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and no such activities in the same period of 2016.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $7.9 million
net cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid $69.1
million of bank loans and received bank loan proceeds of $75.3 million. Also, under the counter-guarantee agreement, we received
$1.8 million from and paid $1.2 million to the related party during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $38.3 million, other current assets of $142.1 million and current liabilities
of $128.7 million. We presently finance our operations primarily from cash flows from operations and bank loans and we anticipate
that these will continue to be our primary sources of funds to finance our short-term cash needs.

All
bank loans are used to fund our daily operations.  

DERIVATIVE
LIABILITY   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had one outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts (sell EUR dollars for RMB) with
a total notional amount of EUR0.65 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had four outstanding forward foreign
exchange contracts (sell US dollars for RMB), with a total notional amount of $11.1 million. The fair value of these
contracts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as realized gains and losses on these foreign currency
derivative activities during 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were not significant.  

Capital
Commitments   

We
have a continuing program for the purpose of improving our manufacturing facilities and extending our retail stores. We anticipate
that cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks will be used to pay for these capital commitments.  

Uses
of Liquidity   

Our
cash requirements for the next twelve months will be primarily to fund daily operations and the growth of our business, some of
this being used to fund new stores.  

Sources
of Liquidity   

Our
primary sources of liquidity for our short-term cash needs are expected to be from cash flows generated from operations, and cash
equivalents currently on hand. We believe that we will be able to borrow additional funds if necessary.  

We
believe our cash flows from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand will be sufficient to meet
our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments for the next twelve months. No assurance can be made
that additional financing will be available to us if required, and adequate funds may not be available on terms acceptable to
us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we will develop or enhance our products or services and expand our business
through our own cash flows from operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had access to approximately $82.3 million in lines of credit, of which approximately $32.8 million was
unused and available. These credit facilities do not include any covenants. We have agreed to provide Jiangsu Ever-Glory a counter-guarantee
of not more than 70% of the maximum aggregate lines of credit and borrowings guaranteed by Jiangsu Ever-Glory and collateralized
by the assets of Jiangsu Ever-Glory under agreements executed between the Company, Jiangsu Ever-Glory and the banks. The maximum
aggregate lines of credit and available borrowings was approximately $54.6 million (RMB364 million) and approximately $17.7 (RMB118
million) was provided to Jiangsu Ever-Glory as the counter guarantee as of September 30, 2016.  

Foreign
Currency Translation Risk   

Our
operations are, for the most part, located in the PRC, which may give rise to significant foreign currency risks from fluctuations
and the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates between the United States dollar and the Chinese RMB. Most of our sales
are in dollars. During 2003 and 2004, the exchange rate of RMB to the dollar remained constant at RMB 8.26 to the dollar. On July
21, 2005, the Chinese government adjusted the exchange rate from RMB 8.26 to 8.09 to the dollar. From that time, the RMB continued
to appreciate against the U.S. dollar. As of September 30, 2016, the market foreign exchange rate had increased to RMB 6.67 to
one U.S. dollar. We are continuously negotiating price adjustments with most of our customers based on the daily market foreign
exchange rates, which we believe will reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the future, and will pass some of the
increased cost to our customers.  

In
addition, the financial statements of Goldenway, New-Tailun, Catch-Luck, Ever-Glory Apparel, Taixin, He Meida, Huirui, Shanghai
LA GO GO, Yalan, Shanghai Yiduo, Tianjin LA GO GO and Jiangsu LA GO GO (whose functional currency is RMB) are translated
into US dollars using the closing rate method. The balance sheet items are translated into US dollars using the exchange rates
at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing
at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. All
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of equity. The foreign currency
translation gain (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was ($0.5) million, ($2.9) million, ($3.3)
million and ($2.9) million, respectively.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to our investors.   

ITEM
    3.   
       QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Our
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, bank loans and long-term
obligations. We consider investments in highly-liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less
from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  

Interest
Rates: Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investments and short-term
obligations; thus, fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities. On September
30, 2016, we had $38.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in either the short term or
long term interest rates would not have any material impact on our earnings or loss, or the fair market value or cash flows of
these instruments.  

Foreign
Exchange Rates: We pay our suppliers and employees in Chinese RMB, however, most of our wholesale customers are located in the
U.S., Japan and Europe and we generate sales from them in U.S. Dollars, Euros and British Pounds. Accordingly, our business
has substantial exposure to changes in exchange rates between and among the Chinese RMB, the U.S. Dollar, the Euro and the British
Pound. In the last decade, the RMB was initially pegged at RMB 8.26 to one U.S. Dollar. On July 21, 2005 it was revalued
to 8.09 per U.S. Dollar. Following the removal of the peg to the U.S. Dollar and pressure from the United States, the People s
Bank of China also announced that the RMB would be pegged to a basket of foreign currencies, rather than being strictly tied to
the U.S. Dollar, and would be allowed to float trade within a narrow 0.3% daily band against this basket of currencies. The PRC
government has stated that the basket is dominated by the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and South Korean Won, with a smaller
proportion made up of the British Pound, Thai Baht, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Singapore Dollar. There
can be no assurance that the relationship between the RMB and these currencies will remain stable over time, especially in light
of the significant political pressure on the Chinese government to permit the free flotation of the RMB, which could result in
greater and more frequent fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB, the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. On September 30, 2016,
the exchange rate between the RMB and U.S. Dollar was RMB6.67 to one U.S. Dollar. For additional discussion regarding our foreign
currency risk, see the section titled Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Fluctuation in the value of Chinese RMB relative to other currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business and/or
an investment in our shares.  

ITEM
    4.   
       CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( the  Exchange Act )  is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2016, the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not operating
effectively as of September 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of certain
 material weaknesses  described in the  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  section in Item 9 of our annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. As of September
30, 2016, we had not completed the remediation of these material weaknesses.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls.  Readers are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error.  An
internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management has worked, and will continue to work to improve our internal controls over financial reporting. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II.  OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.   
       LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS    

We
know of no pending legal proceedings to which we are a party which is material or potentially material, either individually or
in the aggregate. We are from time to time, during the normal course of our business operations, subject to various litigation
claims and legal disputes. We do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

ITEM 1A.   
       RISK
    FACTORS    

There
has been no material change in the information provided in Item 1A of Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015
