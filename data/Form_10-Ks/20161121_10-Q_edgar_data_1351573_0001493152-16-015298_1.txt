NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    

The
Pocket Shot Company, formerly Pocket Shot, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, was initially formed on April 18, 2004.
Under a 351 Exchange Agreement, the members chose to contribute all of their membership interests in the LLC to The Pocket Shot
Company, a Colorado corporation in exchange for shares of common stock of the corporation in accordance with the terms and provisions
of the agreement. The effective date for the exchange was January 1, 2006. The Company has developed a plastic pouch for the packaging
of alcohol under the trademarks Pocketshot and Pocket Shot. They collect royalty income from licensing the right to use the patent
and the trademarks in connection with manufacturing, filling and packaging the pouches with alcohol and the distribution, sale
and advertising of the products under the brand name.  

The
Company s accounting year end is December 31.  

Basis
of Presentation    

These
financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles.  

Management s
Representation of Interim Financial Statements    

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that
the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements include all of the adjustments,
which in the opinion of management are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such
adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements at December 31, 2015 as presented in
the Company s Registration statement on Form S-1filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of Estimates   

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Significant estimates include estimated useful lives and potential impairment of property and equipment, estimate
of fair value of share based payments and derivative instruments and recorded debt discount, valuation of deferred tax assets
and valuation of in-kind contribution of services and interest.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company cash equivalents totaled $47,405 and $156,412 respectively.  

Accounts
Receivable   

We
record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts
to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and is charged to other income (expense) in the combined statements
of operations. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual
terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our customers. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, an allowance for estimated, uncollectible accounts was determined to be unnecessary.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance,
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations
for the respective period. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line
method for financial statement purposes. The Company uses other depreciation methods (generally accelerated) for tax purposes
where appropriate. The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows:  

Computer
    equipment  
      3
    years   
 
      Furniture
    and Equipment  
      5
    years   

Net
Loss per Share    

Net
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as
defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings per common share ( EPS )
calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue when the four revenue recognition criteria are met, as follows:  

Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists    our customary practice is to obtain written evidence, typically in the form
    of a sales contract or purchase order;   

Delivery
       when custody is transferred to our customers either upon shipment to or receipt at our customers  locations,
    with no right of return or further obligations, such as installation;   

The
    price is fixed or determinable    prices are typically fixed at the time the order is placed and no price protections
    or variables are offered; and   

Collectability
    is reasonably assured    we typically work with businesses with which we have a long standing relationship, as well
    as monitoring and evaluating customers  ability to pay.   

Refunds
and returns, which are minimal, are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Payments received by customers prior to our satisfying
the above criteria are recorded as unearned income in the combined balance sheets.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company applies the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 820-10,  Fair
Value Measurements , as well as certain related FASB staff positions. This guidance defines fair value as the price that
would be received from m selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions
that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and
risk of nonperformance.  

The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:  

Level
    1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets
    for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
    or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.   

Level
3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.     

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial instruments approximates their fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915):
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic
810, Consolidation . The update removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage
entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition, the update adds an
example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal
operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to the company s current activities. Furthermore,
the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an
entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements
for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods therein. Early application with the first annual reporting period
or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made
available for issuance (other entities). The Company adopted this pronouncement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In
June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12,  Compensation   Stock Compensation
( Topic 718 ); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved
after the Requisite Service Period . The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees
share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved
after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved
after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in
Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities,
the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December
15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards
granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding
as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of the beginning of the earliest annual
period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at
that date. Additionally, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the
compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  ASU  2014-15 on  Presentation of Financial Statements
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .
Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments
in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by
incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments
(1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods,
(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and
other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to
determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

Company has developed a plastic pouch for the packaging of alcohol under the marks Pocketshot and Pocket Shot. The Company (the
Licensor) entered into an initial agreement dated August 10, 2005 with Frank-Lin Distillers, Ltd (the Licensee) to fill and package
the Company s product. The initial term of the agreement was for five years. The agreement automatically renews for succeeding
terms of two years each unless either party has given a written notice of its election to terminate the agreement at least one
hundred, eighty calendar days prior to the end of any initial or extended term.  

NOTE
6   ROYALTY INCOME

no such events that are material to the financial statements to be disclosed.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Forward-Looking
Statements and Associated Risks.    

This
form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. For this purpose any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed
to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as  may ,  will ,  expect ,
 believe ,  anticipate ,  estimate, or  continue  or comparable terminology are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual
results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include
but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our
chosen industry, including competition from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop
business relationships.   

Based
on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit totaling
$(336,587). This raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Plan
of Operation    

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on December 7, 2005. Our company holds a patent and several trademarks
related to the  Pocket Shot,  an innovative concept that provides the consumer with  grab   go  convenience.
Alcoholic beverages have been packaged in attractive, user-friendly 50ml single serving bottle-shaped plastic stand-up pouch,
and non-alcoholic energy drinks will be produced in the near future. They are easy to stow and use by pouring from a bottleneck
spout, similar to a bottle, and are ideal for active lifestyles.  

Our
primary method of selling is through distributors using an agreement that provides a monthly royalty for us.  

We
had no operations prior to 2005. Though we had income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses were
more than our net income during those periods. We have minimal cash, several intangible assets which consist of our patent, trademarks,
business plan, relationships, and contacts, and some tangible assets of inventory, equipment, and machinery. We are lacking liquidity
and need cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital, or loans from any sources, none of which have been
arranged nor assured.  

Results
of Operations    

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized total revenues of $20,412 compared to $32,395 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease of $11,983 was a result of an decrease in sales of Pocket Shots.  During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a gross margin of $19,807 compared to $17,392 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of $2,415 was due to a large decrease in the cost of sales.   During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we recognized a net loss of $10,214 compared to a net loss of $22,042 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. The net loss decreasing by $11,828 was mainly a result of decreased cost of sales, but also due to decreased operating
expenses, including decreases in advertising and promotion, and travel and entertainment expenses for the quarter ended September
30, 2016.  

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had $72,485 in revenues compared to $49,555 for the same period one year earlier.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses were $99,932 as compared to $83,063 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Some of the categories with larger differences in expenses are discussed here. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 we incurred expenses of $67,800 for general and administrative expenses compared to $47,586 for the same period
in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred depreciation expenses of $17,670 compared to $12,030 for the
corresponding period in 2015. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower expenses in the following categories. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we provided sales incentives in the amount of $831 compared to $6,557 for the corresponding
period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $7,826 for travel expenses compared to $14,790 for the
same period in 2015. The net effect of these changes, was an increase in operating expenses of $16,869.  

Our
auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to whether we will be able to continue to operate as a  going concern 
due to the fact that the Company has an accumulated deficit of $(336,587) as of September 30, 2016, compared to an accumulated
deficit of $(288,809) at December 31, 2015, and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its
operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to
obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.  

Financing
Activities    

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the Company received $0 from subscription agreements or private placement offerings. The
Company also received shareholder contributions in the amount of $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

We
intend to seek additional funding through public or private financings to fund our operations through fiscal 2017 and beyond.
However, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, or achieve cash flow positive operations,
we may have to significantly delay product development and scale back operations both of which may affect our ability to continue
as a going concern.  

Investing
Activities    

The
Company had no investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   

At
September 30, 2016, we have total current assets of $141,876 consisting of $47,405 in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables
of $7,514 and inventory of $86,957. Current liabilities at September 30, 2016 were $2,965 and consisted entirely of royalty payable
to Mr. Bachmann. At September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $ 138,911.  During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we used $25,838 in cash for our operating activities. A net loss of $47,778 for the period was due to increased operating
expenses of $99,932, but was partially offset by higher gross margin of $52,154, compared to $25,263 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we invested in a new filling machine for $83,169, decreasing
our available cash to $47,405.  There were no financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

We
do not currently have any consulting agreements.  

We
do not currently have any outstanding debts, including promissory notes or other bank debt.  

As
at September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $47,405 as compared to $145,557 at September 30, 2015. Our plan for satisfying our
cash requirements for the next twelve months is through the sale of shares of our common stock, third party financing, and/or
traditional bank financing. We do not anticipate generating sufficient amounts of revenues to meet our working capital requirements.
Consequently, we intend to make appropriate plans to ensure sources of additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion
through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities.  

For
the Year Ended December 31, 2015   

At
December 31, 2015, we have total current assets of $255,010 consisting of $156,412 in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables
of $19,444 and inventory of $79,154. Current liabilities at December 31, 2015 were $2,821 and consisted of $1,958 in accounts
payable and $863 in royalty payable to Mr. Bachmann. At December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $252,189.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a positive sum of $39,811 in cash provided from our operating activities. A net loss
of $54,213 for the period was reconciled by such non-cash items as $16,041 in depreciation, $72,722 in accounts receivable, $13,666,
in inventory, and $26 in royalty payable to Mr. Bachmann. $15,000 was due to related parties at December 31, 2015.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, we used $68,951 in our operating activities. A net loss of $68,778 was reconciled for such non-cash
items as $16,040 in depreciation and $19,421 in inventory.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $0 in investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we used $0 in investing
activities.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, $79,000 was received from financing activities through a private placement compared to $0 during
the year ended December 31, 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2015, we issued 790,000 shares of our restricted common
stock, compared to 0 shares during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued $0 in
convertible promissory notes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued $0 in convertible promissory notes to investors.  

Amounts
owed to related parties included in accounts payable totaled $1,958 and $1,958, royalty payable totaled $863 and $837, and amount
due to related parties of $0 and $15,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

The
board of directors has approved and granted Jarrold R. Bachmann an officer and shareholder, a $1.20 per case royalty on sales
of Pocket Shot effective January 1, 2006. Royalty expense for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $2,957 and $5,651
respectively.  

Going
Concern   

We
have only a very limited amount of cash and have incurred operating losses and limited cash flows from operations since inception.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had retained deficit of $336,587 and $288,809 respectively and we will require
additional working capital to fund operations through 2017 and beyond. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements included in this Form S-1 do not include any
adjustments related to recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. The audited financial statements included in the registration
statement have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result
if we cease to continue as a going concern.  

Based
on our financial history since inception, in their report on the financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015,
our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
There is no assurance that any revenue will be realized in the future.  

There
can be no assurance that we will have adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any additional funds will
be available to us when needed or at all, or, if available, will be available on favorable terms or in amounts required by us.
If we are unable to obtain adequate capital resources to fund operations, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate
some or all of our operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to
operate as a going concern.  

Short
Term   

On
a short-term basis, we have not generated revenues sufficient to cover our growth oriented operations plan. Based on prior history,
we may continue to incur losses until such a time that our revenues are sufficient to cover our operating expenses and growth
oriented operations plan. As a result we may need additional capital in the form of equity or loans, none of which is committed
as of this filing.  

Capital
Resources   

We
have only common stock as our capital resource, and our assets, cash and receivables.  

We
have no material commitments for capital expenditures within the next year, however, as operations are expanded substantial capital
will be needed to pay for expansion and working capital.  

Need
for Additional Financing   

We
do not have capital sufficient to meet our growth plans. We have made equity and debt offerings in order to support our growth
plans, to date, and may do so in the future.  

No
commitments to provide additional funds have been made by our management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that any additional funds will be available to us to allow coverage of our expenses as they may be incurred.
