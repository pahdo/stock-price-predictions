(unaudited)

(1)   The condensed statements included herein have been prepared by the registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these condensed statements consist only of normal recurring adjustments.  Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the registrant believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the registrant's latest annual report on Form 10 K.

(2)  Organization  

AEI Income   Growth Fund XXII Limited Partnership ("Partnership") was formed to acquire and lease commercial properties to operating tenants.  The Partnership's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing General Partner.  Robert P. Johnson, the President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Individual General Partner.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the majority shareholder.  AEI Fund Management, Inc. ("AEI"), an affiliate of AFM, performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.

The terms of the Partnership offering called for a subscription price of $1,000 per Limited Partnership Unit, payable on acceptance of the offer.  The Partnership commenced operations on May 1, 1997 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 Limited Partnership Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  The offering terminated January 9, 1999 when the extended offering period expired.  The Partnership received subscriptions for 16,917.222 Limited Partnership Units.  Under the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Limited Partners and General Partners contributed funds of $16,917,222 and $1,000, respectively.

During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which the General Partners determine to distribute will be distributed 97% to the Limited Partners and 3% to the General Partners.  Distributions to Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.

Any Net Proceeds of Sale, as defined, from the sale or financing of properties which the General Partners determine to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves, be paid in the following manner: (i) first, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the Limited Partners receive an amount equal to: (a) their Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 9% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed from Net Cash Flow; (ii) any remaining balance will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Distributions to the Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.

(2)  Organization   (Continued)

For tax purposes, profits from operations, other than profits attributable to the sale, exchange, financing, refinancing or other disposition of property, will be allocated first in the same ratio in which, and to the extent, Net Cash Flow is distributed to the Partners for such year.  Any additional profits will be allocated in the same ratio as the last dollar of Net Cash Flow is distributed.  Net losses from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.

For tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing, or other disposition of property will be allocated in accordance with the Partnership Agreement as follows: (i) first, to those partners with deficit balances in their capital accounts in an amount equal to the sum of such deficit balances; (ii) second, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the aggregate balance in the Limited Partners' capital accounts equals the sum of the Limited Partners' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus an amount equal to 9% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously allocated; (iii) third, the balance of any remaining gain will then be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Losses will be allocated 98% to the Limited Partners and 2% to the General Partners.

The General Partners are not required to currently fund a deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Partnership or withdrawal by a General Partner, the General Partners will contribute to the Partnership an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1% of total Limited Partners' and General Partners' capital contributions.

In May 2015, the Managing General Partner mailed a Consent Statement (Proxy) seeking the consent of the Limited Partners to continue the Partnership for an additional 60 months or to initiate the final disposition, liquidation and distribution of all of the Partnership's properties and assets.  Approval of either proposal required the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding units.  On June 17, 2015, the votes were counted and neither proposal received the required majority vote.  As a result, the Partnership will not liquidate and will continue in operation until the Limited Partners vote to authorize the sale of all of the Partnership's properties or December 31, 2046, as stated in the Limited Partnership Agreement. However, in approximately five years, the Managing General Partner expects to again submit the question to liquidate to a vote by the Limited Partners.

(3)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc.  

AEI Fund Management, Inc. performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.  The payable to AEI Fund Management represents the balance due for those services.  This balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be paid in the normal course of business.

(4)  Discontinued Operations  

After experiencing financial difficulties, the tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Longmont, Colorado filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March 27, 2014.  Shortly thereafter, the tenant closed the restaurant, filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease and returned possession of the property to the Partnership.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, the tenant owed $31,212 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  The Partnership submitted a Proof of Claim for damages to the bankruptcy court.  The tenant's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court effective February 2, 2015.  In August 2015, the Partnership received a payment of $43,813 on its claim from the plan.  In February 2016, the Partnership received a final claim payment of $8,555.

In September 2013, the Partnership decided to sell its 50% interest in the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Longmont, Colorado and classified it as Real Estate Held for Sale.  Since November 2013, the Partnership reached agreements to sell the property to three unrelated third parties.  In each case, the potential buyer subsequently withdrew the offer and cancelled the agreement.  In April 2015, the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell the property to a new buyer.  On June 19, 2015, the sale closed with the Partnership receiving net sale proceeds of $571,525, which resulted in a net gain of $21,525.  At the time of sale, the carrying value of the property was $550,000.  While the property was vacant, the Partnership was responsible for its 50% share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property.

The financial results for this property are reflected as Discontinued Operations in the accompanying financial statements.  The following are the results of discontinued operations:

(5)  Partners' Capital  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $440,415 and $409,686, respectively.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $427,203 and $398,001 and the General Partners received distributions of $13,212 and $11,685 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $29.90 and $26.88 per Limited Partnership Unit outstanding using 14,289 and 14,804 weighted average Units in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distributions represented $9.22 and $11.73 per Unit of Net Income and $20.68 and $15.15 per Unit of return of capital for the periods, respectively.

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds of $30,303 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $30,000 and the General Partners received distributions of $303 for the period.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $2.05 per Unit for the period.

On April 1, 2016, the Partnership repurchased a total of 98.51 Units for $75,011 from 7 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  The Partnership acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  On April 1, 2015, the Partnership repurchased a total of 495.35 Units for $339,265 from 22 Limited Partners.  The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,320 and $3,427 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(6)  Fair Value Measurements  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters.  These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the Partners; 

resolution by the General Partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the General Partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Partnership operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The Partnership's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.  Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Partnership's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  It is possible that the carrying amount of the Partnership's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.

Management of the Partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing partner of the Partnership.

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Partnership records them in the financial statements at cost.  The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property.  Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.

Page 11 of 18 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods.  The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities.  Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.  Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease.  Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease.  These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease.  These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.

The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables.  If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.

Carrying Value of Properties

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  The Partnership tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties the Partnership will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.

Page 12 of 18 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Allocation of Expenses

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs.  They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage.  The Partnership reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement.

Results of Operations

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized rental income from continuing operations of $552,967 and $541,443, respectively.  In 2016, rental income increased due to rent increases on three properties.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties as of October 31, 2016, the Partnership expects to recognize rental income from continuing operations of approximately $741,000 and $755,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration expenses from affiliated parties of $88,719 and $122,745, respectively.  These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Partners.  During the same periods, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $30,886 and $35,649, respectively.  These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized interest income of $2,790 and $2,641, respectively.

If a property was classified as Real Estate Held for Sale at December 31, 2013, the Partnership included the results from operating and selling the property in discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized income from discontinued operations of $8,555, representing a bankruptcy claim payment received.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership recognized income from discontinued operations of $38,688, representing rental income and a bankruptcy claim payment received less property management expenses of $17,163 and gain on disposal of real estate of $21,525.

After experiencing financial difficulties, the tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Longmont, Colorado filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March 27, 2014.  Shortly thereafter, the tenant closed the restaurant, filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease and returned possession of the property to the Partnership.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, the tenant owed $31,212 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  The Partnership submitted a Proof of Claim for damages to the bankruptcy court.  The tenant's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court effective February 2, 2015.  In August 2015, the Partnership received a payment of $43,813 on its claim from the plan.  In February 2016, the Partnership received a final claim payment of $8,555.

In September 2013, the Partnership decided to sell its 50% interest in the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Longmont, Colorado and classified it as Real Estate Held for Sale.  Since November 2013, the Partnership reached agreements to sell the property to three unrelated third parties.  In each case, the potential buyer subsequently withdrew the offer and cancelled the agreement.  In April 2015, the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell the property to a new buyer.  On June 19, 2015, the sale closed with the Partnership receiving net sale proceeds of $571,525, which resulted in a net gain of $21,525.  At the time of sale, the carrying value of the property was $550,000.  While the property was vacant, the Partnership was responsible for its 50% share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property.

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations.  Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership's cash balances decreased $2,607 as a result of distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership's cash balances increased $257,226 as a result of cash generated from the sale of property, which was partially offset by distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $423,654 in 2015 to $515,136 in 2016 as a result of a decrease in Partnership administration and property management expenses in 2016 and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in total rental and interest income in 2016.

The major components of the Partnership's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of $571,525.

Page 14 of 18 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The Partnership's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Partners and cash used to repurchase Units.  The Partnership declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.  The Partnership attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter.  The Partnership may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $440,415 and $409,686, respectively.  Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Partners and 3% to the General Partners.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale were allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $427,203 and $398,001 and the General Partners received distributions of $13,212 and $11,685 for the periods, respectively.  In 2016, distributions declared were higher due to an increase in the distribution rate per Unit, effective July 1, 2015.

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds of $30,303 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $30,000 and the General Partners received distributions of $303 for the period.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $2.05 per Unit for the period.

The Partnership may repurchase Units from Limited Partners who have tendered their Units to the Partnership.  Such Units may be acquired at a discount.  The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated with all other transfers of Units that have occurred since the beginning of the same calendar year (excluding Permitted Transfers as defined in the Partnership Agreement), would exceed 5% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership.

On April 1, 2016, the Partnership repurchased a total of 98.51 Units for $75,011 from 7 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  The Partnership acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  On April 1, 2015, the Partnership repurchased a total of 495.35 Units for $339,265 from 22 Limited Partners.  The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,320 and $3,427 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Partnership obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer, the Managing General Partner of the Partnership evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")).  Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Managing General Partner concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Managing General Partner, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

During the most recent period covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
