           1. 
    ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE FUND 
       
  Venture Lending   Leasing VI, Inc. (the  Fund ), was incorporated in Maryland on January 11, 2010 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company electing status as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and is managed by Westech Investment Advisors, LLC, formerly known as Westech Investment Advisors, Inc. ( Manager  or  Management ). The Fund will be dissolved on December 31, 2020 unless an election is made to dissolve earlier by the Board of Directors of the Fund (the  Board ). One hundred percent of the stock of the Fund is held by Venture Lending   Leasing VI, LLC (the  Company ).  Prior to commencing its operations on June 29, 2010, the Fund had no operations other than the sale to the Company of 100,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value for $25,000 in January 2010.  This issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply for a finance lender's license from the California Commissioner of Corporations, which was obtained on April 13, 2010.  
    
  In the Manager's opinion, the accompanying interim condensed financial statements (hereafter as referred to as  financial statements ) include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations for interim periods. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted; however, the Fund believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The interim results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of what the results would be for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
           2. 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
  Basis of Accounting 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and money market mutual funds with maturities of 90 days or less. Money market mutual funds held as cash equivalents are valued at their most recently traded net asset value. 
    
  Interest Income 
    
  Interest income on loans is recognized using the effective interest method including amounts from the amortization of discounts attributable to equity securities received as part of the loan transaction.  Additionally, fees received as part of the transaction are added to the loan discount and amortized over the life of the loan.  
    
  Investment Valuation Procedures 
    
  The Fund accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the  Valuation Methods  below.  All valuations are determined under the direction of the Manager, in accordance with the Valuation Methods. 

7 

The Fund's loans are valued in connection with the issuance of its periodic financial statements, the issuance or repurchase of the Fund's shares at a price equivalent to the current net asset value per share, and at such other times as required by law.  On a quarterly basis, Management submits to the Board a  Valuation Report  and "Valuation Notes" which detail the rationale for the valuation of investments. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the financial statements include nonmarketable investments of   $35.6 million   and   $95.0 million  , respectively (or   94%   and   95%   of total assets, respectively), with fair values determined by the Manager in the absence of readily determinable market values.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations, estimated fair values of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.  Below is the information used by the Manager in making these estimates. 
    
  Loans 
    
  The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to lower a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  There is no secondary market for the loans made by the Fund to borrowers, hence Management determines fair value based on hypothetical markets.  Venture loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at estimated fair value.  The determination of fair value is based on a number of factors including the amount for which an investment could be exchanged in a current sale, which assumes an orderly disposition over a reasonable period other than in a forced sale.  Management also considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of the investments held by the Fund.  Management determines whether to adjust the estimated fair value of a loan based on a number of factors including but not limited to the borrower's payment history, available cash and  burn rate,  revenues, net income or loss, the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future, as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment.  The amount of any valuation adjustment considers liquidation analysis and is determined based upon a credit analysis of the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the borrower, including consideration of factors such as the nature and quality of the Fund's security interests in collateral, the estimated value of the Fund's collateral, the size of the loan, and the estimated time that will elapse before the Fund achieves a recovery.  Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral, increase in the estimated time to recovery, and increase in the hypothetical market coupon rate would have the effect of lowering the value of the current portfolio of loans. 
    
  Non-accrual Loans 
    
  The Fund's policy is to place a loan on non-accrual status when the portfolio company is delinquent  for three months on its monthly loan payment or ceases or drastically curtails its operations and Management deems that it is unlikely that the loan will return to performing status.  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed for the quarter in which the loan was placed on non-accrual status.  Any uncollected interest related to quarters prior to when the loan was placed on non-accrual status is added to the principal balance, and the aggregate balance of the principal and interest is evaluated in accordance with the policy for valuation of loans in determining Management's best estimate of fair value.  Interest received by the Fund on non-accrual loans will be recognized as interest income if and when the proceeds exceed the book value of the loans. 
    
  If a borrower of a non-accrual loan resumes making regular payments and is deemed by Management to have the ability to service the loan on a sustainable basis, the loan is re-classified back to accrual or performing status.  Interest that would have been accrued during the non-accrual status will be added back to the remaining payment schedule, and thus changing the effective interest rate.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , loans with a cost basis of   $21.1 million   and a fair value of   $7.4 million  , have been classified as non-accrual.  As of   December 31, 2015  , loans with a cost basis of   $20.9 million   and a fair value of   $7.0 million  , have been classified as non-accrual.  
  
    8 

Warrants and Stock 
    
  Warrants and stock that are received in connection with loan transactions generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of acquisition. These securities are then distributed by the Fund to its shareholder at the assigned value. Warrants are valued based on a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into account factors underlying stock value, expected term, volatility and the risk-free interest rate, among other factors.   
  Underlying asset value is estimated based on information available, including information regarding recent rounds of funding of the portfolio company, or the publicly-quoted stock price at the end of the financial reporting period for warrants for comparable publicly-quoted securities.   
  Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price, is based on an index of publicly traded companies grouped by industry and which are similar in nature to the underlying portfolio companies issuing the warrant ( Industry Index ).  The volatility assumption for each Industry Index is based on the average volatility for individual public companies within the portfolio company's industry for a period of time approximating the expected life of the warrants.  A hypothetical increase in the volatility of the warrants used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
  The remaining expected lives of warrants are based on historical experience of the average life of the warrants, as warrants are often exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers, or initial public offerings and terminated due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities, or additional financings.  These events cause the expected term to be less than the remaining contractual term of the warrants. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Fund assumed the average duration of a warrant is 3.5 years. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated initial term of the warrants used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
  The risk-free interest rate is derived from the constant maturity tables issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated risk-free rate used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants. 
    
  The Fund engages an independent valuation company to provide valuation assistance including the evaluations of the Fund's valuation methodology and the reasonableness of the assumptions used from the perspective of a market participant.  They calculate several of the inputs used such as volatility and risk-free rate.  Upon the receipt of such data from the valuation company, a sample test is performed to ensure the accuracy of their calculations and that the source of data is reliable and consistent with the way in which the calculations were made in prior periods.  Such inputs are entered into the database with a second review to ensure the accuracy of the input information.  All calculations of warrant values are performed by one employee and reviewed by a second employee.  The inputs of the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model are reevaluated every quarter. 
       
  Other Assets and Liabilities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of Other Assets and Liabilities are estimated at their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these assets or liabilities. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , based on borrowing rates available to the Fund, the estimated fair values of the borrowings under the debt facility were   $40.4 million  . No borrowings were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 

9 

Commitment Fees 
    
  Unearned income and commitment fees on loans are recognized as additional interest on loans using the effective interest method over the term of the loan. Commitment fees are carried as liabilities when received for commitments upon which no draws have been made. When the first draw is made, the fee is treated as unearned income and is recognized as described above.  If a draw is never made, the forfeited commitment fee less any applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the commitment expires.  
    
  Deferred Bank Fees 
    
  The deferred bank fees and costs associated with the debt facility have been amortized over the estimated life of the facility, which was originally determined to be until January 2014. Starting in October 2011, the estimated life of the facility changed to September 2014.  The debt facility was extended again on September 23, 2014 and then on September 30, 2014, it was amended, restated and renewed through March 23, 2017. Deferred bank fees and costs associated with the renewal of the debt facility are being amortized over the estimated life of the renewed facility.  They were fully amortized on August 5, 2016 when the debt facility was terminated. The deferred bank fees are included in Other Assets in the Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The amortization of these costs was recorded as interest expense in the Condensed Statements of Operations (see Note 7). 
    
  Interest Rate Cap Agreements 
    
  On September 30, 2014, the Fund entered into interest rate cap agreements which are primarily valued on the basis of the future expected interest rates on the notional principal balance remaining, which is comparable to what a prospective acquirer would pay on the measurement date. Valuation pricing models consider inputs such as forward rates, anticipated interest rate volatility relating to the reference rate, as well as time value and other factors underlying cap instruments. The contracts are recorded at fair value in interest rate caps in the Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The changes in fair value are recorded in Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. The interest received on the interest rate cap contracts, if any, is recorded in Net realized gain (loss) from hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU   ) 2015-03 Interest-Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. Debt issuance costs related to lines of credit and revolving debt facilities are not required to be deducted from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The amended guidance is effective for the Fund s interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not significantly impact the Fund s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Tax Status 
    
  The Fund has elected to be treated as a Regulated Investment Company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ) and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. Failing to maintain at least 70% of total assets in  qualifying assets  will result in the loss of BDC status, resulting in losing its favorable tax treatment as a RIC. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund has met the BDC and RIC requirements. 
    
  In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Fund is required to distribute annually to its shareholder at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. To avoid federal excise taxes, the Fund must distribute annually at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of net capital gains from the current year and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding years. The Fund, at its discretion, may  
  
    10 

carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If the Fund chooses to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to shareholder. The Fund will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. Below is a table summarizing the cost (on GAAP and tax basis) and the appreciation and depreciation of the investments reported on the Schedule of Investments in Note 3 below. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  : 

As of   December 31, 2015  : 

Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to paid-in-capital or accumulated net realized gain (loss), as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Fund's annual RIC tax return. 
    
  Book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified among the Fund's capital accounts. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no undistributed earnings. Additionally, for the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016  , distributions were made in excess of distributable earnings by $ 21.1 million.  The Fund may pay distributions in excess of its taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the shareholder's tax basis in its shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no uncertain tax positions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund had no capital loss carry forwards. 
    
  The Fund's tax years are open to examination by federal tax authorities for the years 2013 and forward and California tax authorities for the years 2012 and forward.

  *** Indicates assets that are not senior loans. 
    
  4. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
    
  Loans generally are made to borrowers pursuant to commitments whereby the Fund agrees to finance assets and provide working or growth capital up to a specified amount for the term of the commitment, upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified by such commitment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Fund's investments in loans were primarily to companies based within the United States and were diversified among borrowers in the industry segments shown below.  The percentage of net assets that each industry group represents is shown with the industry totals below  (the sum of the percentages does not equal 100 percent because the percentages are based on net assets as opposed to total loans).  All loans are senior to unsecured creditors, but Akademos, Inc., while senior to unsecured creditors, is junior to other secured creditors. 
    
  The Fund provides asset-based financing primarily to start-up and emerging growth venture-capital-backed companies.  These loans are generally secured by assets of the borrowers.  As a result, the Fund is generally subject to credit risk associated with such companies.  
    
  The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability was exchanged in an orderly transaction; it was not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. 
    
  Loan balances are summarized by borrower.  Typically a borrower's balance will be composed of several loans drawn under a commitment made by the Fund with the interest rate on each loan fixed at the time each loan is funded. Each loan drawn under a commitment may have a different maturity date and amount.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the weighted-average interest rate on the performing loans was 17.26% and 16.42%, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the weighted-average interest rate on the performing loans was 17.00% and 19.06%, respectively. These rates were inclusive of both cash and non-cash interest income.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the weighted-average interest rate on the cash portion of the interest income was 12.35% and 12.33%, respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the weighted-average interest rate on the cash portion of the interest income was 12.47% and 14.47%, respectively. Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many factors including early payoffs, volatility of values ascribed to warrants and new loans funded during the period.  
    
  The risk profile of a loan changes when events occur that impact the credit analysis of the borrower and loan as described in our loan accounting policy. Such changes result in the fair value adjustment made to the individual loans. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, which is primarily the case for this loan portfolio, the par value of the loan will approximate fair value. 
    
  All loans as of   September 30, 2016   were pledged as collateral for the debt facility, and the Fund's borrowings are subsequently collateralized by all assets of the Fund. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Fund had unexpired unfunded commitments to borrowers of $0 million and   $1.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  Valuation Hierarchy 
    
  Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )   820-10 Fair Value Measurement  , the Fund categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the Fund's valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is  
  
    18 

significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: 
                   Level 1 
      
    Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
      Level 2 
      
    Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
      Level 3 
      
    Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Transfers of investments between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recorded on the actual date of the event or 
  change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers in and out of Level 1, 2, and 3 during the 
  period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Fund's cash equivalents were valued at the traded net asset value of the money market mutual fund. As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 1. The Fund's investments in the interest rate cap are based on quotes from the market makers that derive fair values from market data, and therefore, are classified as Level 2. The Fund uses estimated exit values when determining the value of its investments.  Because loan transactions are individually negotiated and unique, and there is no market in which these assets trade, the inputs for these assets, which are discussed in the Valuation Methods listed above, are classified as Level 3. 
    
  The following tables provide quantitative information about the Fund's Level 3 fair value measurements of its investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, the Fund may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining its fair value measurements.

           5. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
       
  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding, including the  
  
    21 

dilutive effects of potential common shares (e.g., stock options).  The Fund held no instruments that would be potential common shares; thus, reported basic and diluted earnings per share are the same. 

6. 
    CAPITAL STOCK 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Fund had 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock authorized, and 100,000 shares issued and outstanding.  Total committed capital of the Company, as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $294.0   million.  Total contributed capital to the Company through   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $279.3   million, of which   $241.5 million   was contributed to the Fund.  The remaining   $14.7   million in committed capital as of   September 30, 2016   expired in June 2015 as the five year anniversary passed. No further capital can be called.   
    
  The chart below shows the distributions of the Fund for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

Final classification of the distributions as either a return of capital or a distribution of income is an annual determination made at the end of each year dependent upon the Fund's current year and cumulative earnings and profits. 
    
  7. DEBT FACILITY 
    
  The Fund established a secured revolving loan facility in an amount of up to $160 million with Union Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bank Leumi USA on September 23, 2011 (the "Loan Agreement").  Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by all of the assets of the Fund. The Fund paid interest on its borrowings, and also paid a fee on the unused portion of the facility.  
    
  The Loan Agreement was extended on September 23, 2014 and then amended and restated in its entirety on September 30, 2014, reducing the size to $120 million, and securing an initial 12-month repayment plan and a subsequent 18-month amortized repayment plan. The size of the facility was reduced to   $84 million   on April 15, 2015,   $74 million   on June 12, 2015,   $64 million   on July 21, 2015 and   $54 million   on   August 20, 2015  , and by $3 million per month from October 23, 2015 to April 23, 2016, by $10 million on May 18, 2016, by $2.1 million on May 23, 2016 and June 23, 2016. The facility was paid off and the Fund terminated the facility on August 5, 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt facility balance is zero. 
    
  Amounts borrowed under the Loan Agreement may be, at the option of the Fund, either Reference Rate Loans or LIBOR loans at an annual rate of either LIBOR plus 2.75% or the Reference Rate plus 1.75%. A Reference Rate Loan is defined as a Loan bearing interest at the highest of: (a) the Federal Funds Rate for such day plus one percent (1.0%), and (b) the rate most recently announced by Union Bank, N.A at its corporate headquarters as the  Union Bank, N.A. Reference Rate . A LIBOR Rate Loan is defined as a Loan bearing interest at the prevailing LIBOR rate determined by Union Bank, N.A. to be the per annum rate (rounded upward to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent (1/100%)) at which Dollar deposits in immediately available funds and in lawful money of the United States would be offered to Union Bank, N.A., on behalf of Union Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bank Leumi USA, outside of the United States at approximately 11:00 a.m. (LIBOR time) three (3) Business Days before the first day of such LIBOR Loan Period, in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount of, and for a length of time approximately equal to the LIBOR Loan Period for, the LIBOR Loan sought by the Fund. 

22 

Bank fees of $280,000 and legal fees of $59,983 were incurred in connection with the renewal of the facility on September 30, 2014. The bank fees and other costs incurred are capitalized and amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the expected life of the facility. They were fully amortized in the quarter when the debt facility was terminated on August 5, 2016. 
    
  8. INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT 
    
  On September 30, 2014, the Fund had entered into two interest rate cap contracts with MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to cap floating interest rates at 0.7%. The purpose of the interest rate cap contract is to protect the Fund against rising interest rates, as the Fund originates loans with fixed interest rates. There were not any additional contracts entered into since September 30, 2014. The notional principal amount decreases as the expected outstanding balance under the debt facility decreases. As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional principal amount was $14.0 million. The Fund paid upfront fees of $230,000 which are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the instrument and receives from the counterparty a payment of interest amounts above the 0.7% cap based on 30-day LIBOR. Payments, if necessary are made monthly and will terminate on  March 23, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 30 day LIBOR rate was 0.5311%. 
    
  The average notional amount outstanding was $16.0 million and $48.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and    September 30, 2015  . The average notional amount outstanding was $22.4 million and $60.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and    September 30, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Fund's derivative financial instruments was as follows:

9.  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
    
  GAAP requires disclosure of financial highlights of the Fund for the periods presented, the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The total rate of return is defined as the return based on the change in value during the period of a theoretical investment made at the beginning of the period.  The total rate of return assumes a constant rate of return for the Fund during the period reported and weights each cash flow by the amount of time held in the Fund.  This required methodology differs from an internal rate of return.  
  
    23 

The ratios of expenses and net investment income to average net assets, calculated below, are annualized and are computed based upon the aggregate weighted average net assets of the Fund for the periods presented.  Net investment income is inclusive of all investment income net of expenses, and excludes realized or unrealized gains and losses. 
    
  Beginning and ending net asset values per share are based on the beginning and ending number of shares outstanding. 
  Other per share information is calculated based upon the aggregate weighted average net assets of the Fund for the periods presented. 
    
  The following per share data and ratios have been derived from the information provided in the financial statements:

  Overview 
    
  The Fund is 100% owned by Venture Lending   Leasing VI, LLC (the  Company ).  The Fund's shares of Common Stock, at $0.001 par value, were sold to its shareholder, the Company, under a stock purchase agreement.  The Fund has issued 100,000 of the Fund's 10,000,000 authorized shares.  The Company will not make additional capital contributions to the Fund. 
    
  The Fund is a financial services company primarily providing financing and advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venture-backed companies primarily located throughout the United States with a focus on growth-oriented companies.  The Fund's portfolio is well diversified and consists of companies in the communications, information services, media, and technology, including software and technology-enabled business services, bio-technology, and medical devices industry sectors, among others.  The Fund's capital is generally used by our portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets and/or for working capital.  On June 29, 2010, the Fund completed its first closing of capital contributions, made its first investments, and became a non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Fund elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code with the filing of its federal corporate income tax return for 2010.  Pursuant to this election, the Fund generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income it distributes to the Company as dividends, allowing the Company to substantially reduce or eliminate its corporate-level tax liability.  
    
  The Fund will seek to meet the ongoing requirements, including the diversification requirements, to qualify as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code.  If the Fund fails to meet these requirements, it would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income were distributed to the Company) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits would be taxable to the Members of the Company as ordinary income; thus, such income would be subject to a double layer of tax.  There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the ongoing requirements to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes.  
    
  The Fund's investment objective is to achieve superior risk adjusted investment returns.  The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies.  Since inception, the Fund's investing activities have focused primarily on private debt securities.  The Fund generally receives warrants to  
  
    25 

acquire equity securities in connection with its portfolio investments.  The Fund distributes these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt.  The Fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets which will be invested in different types of assets. 
    
  The portfolio investments of the Fund primarily consist of debt financing to venture capital backed companies.  The borrower's ability to repay its loans may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, and as a result, the loan may not fully be repaid.  Furthermore, the Fund's security interest in any collateral over the borrower's assets may be insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments. 
    
  Transactions with Venture Lending   Leasing V, Inc. ( Fund V ) 
    
  The Manager also served as investment manager for Fund V, which was dissolved on August 6, 2014 and no longer funded any commitments. However, prior to the dissolution of Fund V, the Fund's Board of Directors determined that so long as Fund V has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than December 31, 2015 (the date on which Fund V was planned to be dissolved), the Fund will invest in each portfolio company in which Fund V invests ( Investments ). Initially the amount of each Investment was allocated 50% to the Fund and 50% to Fund V so long as Fund V had capital available to invest. After February 2011, Fund V was no longer permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers. The Fund commenced its investment period on June 29, 2010 and after June 29, 2014, the Fund was no longer permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers; and all commitments have expired.   
    
  Transactions with Venture Lending   Leasing VII, Inc. ( Fund VII ) 
    
  The Manager also serves as investment manager for Fund VII. The Fund's Board of Directors determined that so long as the Fund has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than December 31, 2020 (the date on which the Fund will be dissolved), the Fund had invested in each portfolio company in which Fund VII invested ( Investments ). Initially the amount of each Investment had been allocated 50% to the Fund and 50% to Fund VII so long as the Fund has capital available to invest. The Fund commenced its investment period on June 29, 2010 and after June 29, 2014, the Fund was no longer permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers; and all commitments have expired. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Manager has identified the most critical accounting estimates upon which the financial statements depend and determined the critical accounting estimates by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The two critical accounting policies relate to the valuation of loans and treatment of non-accrual loans.     
    
  Loans are held at fair value as determined by Management, in accordance with the valuation methods described in the valuation of loans section of Note 2 in the Fund's financial statements (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).  Critical factors in determining the fair value of a loan include payment history, collateral position, financial strength of the borrower, prospects for the borrower raising future equity rounds, likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower, and length of expected holding period of the loan, as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment.  The actual value of the loans may differ from Management's estimates, which would affect net change in net assets resulting from operations as well as assets. 
    
  Results of Operations - For the Three and   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Total investment income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $1.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of interest on the venture loans outstanding. Total investment income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $7.3 million   and   $23.9 million  , respectively, which primarily consisted of interest on the venture loans outstanding. The remaining income consisted of interest and dividends on the temporary investment of cash, forfeited commitment fees, and fees earned from waivers to  
  
    26 

loan agreements. The decrease in investment income was due to the decrease in the average loans outstanding from $122.5 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 34.9 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and from $161.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $54.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Management fees for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Management fees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $1.0 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively.  Management fees are calculated as 2.5 percent of the Fund's total assets. Management fees decreased because assets under management as of   September 30, 2016   were lower than assets as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Total interest expense was $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total interest expense was   $0.7 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the debt facility payoff in August 2016. The average borrowings decreased from $58.5 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $4.5 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and from $77.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $20.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Total banking and professional fees were $0.1 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total banking and professional fees were   $0.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The banking and professional fees were comprised of legal, audit, banking and other professional fees. The decrease was primarily due to lower accounting and legal fees. 
    
  Total other operating expenses were less than $0.1 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Total other operating expenses were $0.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Net investment income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was $1.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Net investment income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $5.1 million   and   $18.5 million  , respectively 
    
  Net realized loss from investments was  $3.9 million and $2.7 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net realized loss from investments was   $5.0 million   and   $4.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  Net change in unrealized gain from investments was $3.6 million and $2.3 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from investments was   $0.3 million   and   $(6.6) million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The unrealized loss consists of fair market value adjustments to loans.  
    
  Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities was less than $0.1 million and less than $(0.1) million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities was less than $0.1 million and ($0.1 million) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Fund entered into interest rate swap transactions with Union Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rates, which terminated on September 23, 2014.  On September 30, 2014, the Fund entered into interest rate cap transactions with Union Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to cap the floating rate liabilities at a fixed rate (see Note 8 in the Fund's financial statements). 
    
  Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $0.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.5 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively. On a per share basis, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $8.21 and $32.69 for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. On a per share basis, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was   $4.78   and   $77.26   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  
    27 

Liquidity and Capital Resources     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015    
    
  Total capital contributed to the Fund was   $241.5 million  , prior to distribution of capital, as of   September 30, 2016  . Committed capital to the Company at   September 30, 2016   was   $294.0   million, of which   $279.3   million had been called.  The remaining   $14.7   million in committed capital as of   September 30, 2016   expired in June 2015 as the five year anniversary passed. No further capital can be called.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   4%   and   3%  , respectively, of the Fund's assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.  The Fund invested its assets in venture loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  No loans were disbursed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Net loan amounts outstanding after amortization and fair market adjustment decreased by approximately $59.4 million for the same period.  There were no unexpired, unfunded commitments as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Because venture loans are privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are relatively illiquid.  It is the Fund's experience that not all unfunded commitments will be used by borrowers. 
    
  The Fund seeks to meet the requirements to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to the Company.  To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must distribute to the Company for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (consisting generally of net investment income and net short-term capital gain) ( Distribution Requirement ).  To the extent that the terms of the Fund's venture loans provide for the receipt by the Fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term or provide for the receipt by the Fund of a purchase price for the asset at the end of the loan term ( residual income ), the Fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan, and to include such accrued income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year.  Thus, in order to meet the Distribution Requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or an excise tax on undistributed income, the Fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives.  Those distributions will be made from the Fund's cash assets, from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds. 
    
  The Fund has adequate cash reserves and approximately $22.9 million in scheduled receivable payments over the next year.  These amounts are sufficient for operational expenses of the Fund over the next year.  Since the Fund is no longer making new commitments, liquidity demands will continue to decrease.   
    
  Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The Fund's business activities contain elements of risk.  The Fund considers the principal types of market risk to be interest rate risk and credit risk.  The Fund considers the management of risk essential to conducting its business and to maintaining profitability.  Accordingly, the Fund's risk management procedures are designed to identify and analyze the Fund's risks, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs.   
    
  The Fund manages its market risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diverse by industry, size of investment, stage of development, and borrower. The Fund has limited exposure to public market price fluctuations as the Fund  
  
    28 

primarily invests in private business enterprises and the Fund distributes all equity investments upon receipt to the Company. 
    
  The Fund's investments are subject to market risk based on several factors, including, but not limited to, the borrower's credit history, available cash, support of the borrower's underlying investors, available liquidity, "burn rate", revenue income, security interest, secondary markets for collateral, the size of the loan, term of the loan, and the ability to exit via Initial Public Offering or Merger and Acquisition.  
    
  The Fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates is regularly monitored and analyzed by measuring the characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Fund utilizes various methods to assess interest rate risk in terms of the potential effect on interest income net of interest expense, the value of net assets and the value at risk in an effort to ensure that the Fund is insulated from any significant adverse effects from changes in interest rates.  
    
  Because the Fund paid off its loan facility on August 5, 2016 and does not plan to borrow in the future, a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material effect on the Fund s interest expense. 
    
  The Fund does not take into consideration potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in the portfolio. It also does not assume any repayments from borrowers or defaults on borrowings.  Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the table above. 

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures: 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Fund's chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the Fund's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based upon this evaluation, the Fund's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Fund's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them of any material information relating to the Fund that is required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls: 
    
  There were no changes in the Fund's internal controls or in other factors that could materially affect these controls during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

PART II       OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1.      Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Fund may become party to certain lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business.  While the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, the Fund does not expect any such proceedings will have a material effect upon the Fund's financial condition or results of operation.  Management is not aware of any pending legal proceedings involving the Fund.   
    
  Item 1A.      Risk Factors 
    
  See item 1A - 'Risk Factors' in the Fund's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the risks attendant to the Fund and its business. There were no material changes to these factors during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

No other shares of the Fund have been sold; however, the Fund received an additional   $241.5 million   of paid in capital during the period from June 29, 2010 through   September 30, 2016   which was used to acquire venture loans and fund operations.
