to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1.     Basis
of Presentation: 

The unaudited
consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for interim financial information, as well
as the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of the
Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of only
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the interim financial statements have been
included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31,
2016. 

Certain
consolidated financial statement amounts for the three and nine
month periods ended June 30, 2015, have been reclassified to
conform to the 2016 presentation.  These
reclassifications had no effect on the net income (loss) or cash
flows or accumulated deficit as previously reported. 

For further
information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred
interest expense of $96,479 and $25,295, respectively, of which
$39,276, and $25,113, respectively, has been capitalized as part of
the cost of construction projects in Mexico. 

2.   
Income (Loss) Per Common Share: 

Basic earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per
share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents, including warrants to purchase
the Company's common stock and convertible preferred
stock.  Warrants equal to common stock equivalents of
169,872 shares have been added to the weighted average shares of
outstanding common stock of 66,130,650 at September 30, 2015, to
determine the diluted income per share for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  Management has determined that the
calculation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, is not applicable since any additions to
outstanding shares related to common stock equivalents would be
anti-dilutive. 

As of September 30,
2016 and 2015, the potentially dilutive common stock equivalents
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as
their effect would have been anti-dilutive are as
follows:

3.   
 Inventories:  

Inventories at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted primarily of
finished antimony products, antimony metal, antimony ore, and
finished zeolite products that are stated at the lower of first-in,
first-out cost or estimated net realizable value. Finished antimony
products, antimony metal and finished zeolite products costs
include raw materials, direct labor and processing facility
overhead costs and freight. Inventory at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, is as follows: 

During the first
quarter of 2015 the Company discovered it had been overcharged for
raw material purchases from a vendor.  The Company
brought the matter to the vendor s attention and received a
$914,967 credit to accounts payable due the vendor that was
recorded as a gain on liability adjustment during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

4.   
 Accounts
Receivable and Due to Factor:  

The Company factors
designated trade receivables pursuant to a factoring agreement with
LSQ Funding Group L.C., an unrelated factor (the
 Factor ).  The agreement specifies that
eligible trade receivables are factored with recourse. We submit
selected trade receivables to the factor, and receive 83% of the
face value of the receivable by wire transfer. The Factor withholds
15% as retainage, and 2% as a servicing fee.  Upon
payment by the customer, we receive the remainder of the amount due
from the factor.  The 2% servicing fee is recorded on the
consolidated statement of operations in the period of sale to the
factor. John Lawrence, CEO, is a personal guarantor of the
amount due to Factor.  

Trade receivables
assigned to the Factor are carried at the original invoice amount
less an estimate made for doubtful accounts.  Under the
terms of the recourse provision, the Company is required to
reimburse the Factor, upon demand, for factored receivables that
are not paid on time.  Accordingly, these receivables are
accounted for as a secured financing arrangement and not as a sale
of financial assets.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on management s regular evaluation of individual
customer s receivables and consideration of a
customer s financial condition and credit
history.  Trade receivables are written off when deemed
uncollectible.  Recoveries of trade receivables
previously written off are recorded when
received.  Interest is not charged on past due
accounts.

current liabilities.

 Properties,

Guadalupe  

On March 7, 2012
and on April 4, 2012 the Company entered into a supply agreement
and a loan agreement, respectively, ( the Agreements )
with several individuals collectively referred to as  Grupo
Roga  or  Guadalupe.   During the term
of the supply agreement the Company funded certain of
Guadalupe s equipment purchases, tax payments, labor costs,
milling and trucking costs, and other expenses incurred in the
Guadalupe mining operations for approximately $112,000. In addition
to the advances for mining costs, the Company purchased antimony
ore from Guadalupe that failed to meet agreed upon antimony metal
recoveries and resulted in approximately $475,000 of excess
advances paid to Guadalupe. 

The Agreements with
Guadalupe (Grupo Roga) granted the Company an option to purchase
the concessions outright for $2,000,000.  On September
29, 2015, the Company notified the owners of Guadalupe that it was
exercising the option to purchase the Guadalupe property. The
option exercise agreement allowed the Company to apply all amounts
previously due the Company by Grupo Roga of $586,892 to the
purchase price consideration, resulting in a net obligation for the
purchase of the Guadalupe mine of $1,413,107. The Company is
obligated to make annual payments that vary from $60,000 to
$149,077 annually through 2026.  The debt payments are
non-interest bearing. The Company recorded $972,722 as the cost of
the concessions and the debt payable equal to total payments due of
$1,413,107 less a discount of $440,385.  The discount is
being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
method over the life of the debt.  During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company made $45,000 in payments
toward this debt and amortized $43,735 of discount as interest
expense.   The net balance of the debt at September
30, 2016 was $971,085.

 Commitments
and Contingencies:  

In 2005, Antimonio
de Mexico S.A. de C.V. ( AM ) signed an option
agreement that gives AM the exclusive right to explore and develop
the San Miguel I and San Miguel II concessions for annual
payments.  Total payments will not exceed $1,430,344,
reduced by taxes paid.  During the year ended December
31, 2015, and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $100,000
and $67,608, respectively, was paid and capitalized as mineral
rights in accordance with the Company s accounting
policies.  At March 31, 2016, a final payment of $11,739
was made. 

In June of 2013,
the Company entered into a lease to mine antimony ore from
concessions located in the Wadley Mining district in
Mexico.  The lease calls for a mandatory term of one year
and, as of September 30, 2016, requires payments of $10,000 plus a
tax of $1,600, per month.  The lease is renewable each
year with a 15 day notice to the lessor, and agreement of
terms.   The lease was renewed in June of
2016. 

From time to time,
the Company is assessed fines and penalties by the Mine Safety and
Health Administration ( MSHA ).  As of
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, the
Company had no liabilities due to MSHA. 

During the first
quarter of 2015, the Company discovered that we did not have IMMEX
certification and that the Company would be required to obtain
it.  Without the IMMEX certification, the Company was
required to pay the national sales tax of 16% on all items that the
Company imports into Mexico, including capital items and the
concentrates from Hillgrove of Australia.  IMMEX requires
that the Company export a minimum of 60% of everything that is
imported into Mexico.  The Company has met this
requirement at this time.  At September 30, 2016, and
December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $146,500 and
$167,000, respectively, included in other current assets, on
deposit with the Mexican tax authorities. The Company believes that
this will either ultimately be refunded, or applied to reduce other
tax liabilities. 

In prior years, the
Company utilized Providence Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( Providence ), and Herbert   A. Denton to
provide investor relations services.  On April 1, 2015, we
entered into an agreement with Providence to provide us services as
our Investor Relations Representative.  We terminated this
agreement in May 2015, and signed a Settlement Agreement dated July
27, 2015, and a Supplemental Settlement Agreement dated August 1,
2015.  These agreements provided for a payment to Mr. Denton
of 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock and $25,000
to be paid in five equal installments. On August 31, 2015, we
issued 100,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.55 per share or
$55,000 to Mr. Denton.  On October 12, 2015, we served Mr.
Denton with a notice of material breach of the termination
agreements and suspended the remaining payments of $15,000. We have
subsequently filed an action in federal court to force Mr. Denton
to comply with the terms of the termination agreements and for
damages related to his non-compliance.  Subsequent to the
Company s filing, Mr. Denton filed a counterclaim against the
Company seeking an award for damages for breach of contract,
conversion, defamation of character, failure to exercise business
judgement and intentional infliction of emotional duress and damage
to reputation. During the second quarter 2016, the Company settled
with Mr. Denton with a payment of $10,000.   All claims
and counterclaims have been dismissed.

9.   
Hillgrove Advances Payable 

On November 7,
2014, the Company entered into a loan and processing agreement with
Hillgrove Mines Pty Ltd of Australia (Hillgrove) by which Hillgrove
will advance the Company funds to be used to expand their smelter
in Madero, Mexico, and in Thompson Falls, Montana, so that they may
process antimony and gold concentrates produced by Hillgrove s
mine in Australia. The agreement requires that the Company
construct equipment so that it can process approximately 200 metric
tons of concentrate per month, with a provision so that the Company
may expand to process more than that. The parties agreed that the
equipment will be owned by USAC and USAMSA. The final terms of when
the repayment takes place have not yet been agreed on. The
agreement called for the Company to sell the final product for
Hillgrove, and Hillgrove to have approval rights of the customers
for their products. The agreement allows the Company to recover its
operating costs as approved by Hillgrove, and to charge a 7.5%
processing fee and a 2.0% sales commission. The initial term of the
agreement was five years, and that agreement was amended later to
be eight years; however, Hillgrove may suspend or terminate the
agreement at its discretion. The Company may terminate the
agreement and begin using the furnaces for their own production if
Hillgrove fails to recommence shipments within 365 days of a
suspension notice. If a stop notice is issued between one year and
two years, there is a formula to prorate the repayment amount from
50% to 81.25%. If a stop order is issued after two years, the
repayment obligation is 81.25% of the funds advanced at that point.
At December 31, 2015, management determined that it is likely that
the Company's repayment obligation will be 81.25% of the total
amounts advanced. As of September 30, 2016, Hillgrove had advanced
the Company approximately $1.4 million. Of this amount, $262,500
was recorded as deferred earned credit and is being recognized
ratably through the period ending November 7, 2016 which is when
the 81.25% repayment terms of the agreement is applicable. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $109,392 and
$58,139, respectively, of the deferred earned credit was recognized
with $10,937 to be recognized in the remainder of 2016. At
September 30, 2016, the amount due to Hillgrove for advances was
$1,134,221 which is approximately 81.25% of the total amount
advanced.

Related Party Transactions: 

During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Chairman of
the audit and compensation committee received $9,000 and $27,000,
respectively, for services performed. 

During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid
$6,387 and $9,443, and $12,099 and $28,865, respectively, to John
Lawrence, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as
reimbursement for equipment used by the Company. 

12. 
Income Taxes: 

United States  

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, it was determined that, after
utilization of the Company s net operating loss carry
forwards, a tax liability of $12,979 was due for income taxes in
the United States. 

Management
estimates the effective tax rate in the United States at 0% for the
current year. 

Mexico  

On October 25,
2016, the national tax authority ( SAT ) in Mexico
notified us that they had completed its audit of our 2013 tax
filing and have determined that we owe $781,947 in income taxes and
penalties.  We are required to respond to SAT of our
intentions by December 6, 2016.    We plan to enter
into negotiation with the authorities and have engaged legal and
tax counsel in Mexico to guide us through our options.
  Based on preliminary discussions, we believe that it is
probable that we will pay at least some type of assessment and have
determined a most likely estimate of our ultimate liability will be
$410,510.   Accordingly, we have recorded a tax provision
and a corresponding liability for this amount as of September 30,
2016.   We hope to be able to pay the amount over a
period of 24 months.   At this time, however, there can
be no assurance as to whether SAT will accept this settlement and
we may need to pay the entire assessed amount.

Income Taxes, Continued: 

We anticipate that
our assessment can be partially settled by applying our IVA tax (a
national sales type tax) refund against the settlement
amount.  At September 30, 2016, we have approximately $140,000
of IVA tax on deposit with the SAT which is currently a current
asset as of September 30, 2016. 

The assessment
relates to our 2013 tax filing in Mexico.   SAT has not
notified us whether other tax filings for the year 2011, 2012, 2014
or 2015 will also be examined.   We could be assessed
additional amounts if this occurs.     Because
of taxable operating losses in early years and the potential for
offset of operating income in later years, management has not yet
determined the impact of these open years as of September 30, 2016
and has not recorded any liability that may result if there are
additional audits by SAT.    Management will
continue to assess the situation.

Stockholder s Equity: 

Issuance of Common Stock for Payable
to Board of Directors  

During the nine

September 30, 2016, the Company accrued $112,500 in
directors  fees payable that will be paid in common
stock. 

During the nine
months ended September  30,  2015, the Board of
Directors was issued a total of 183,825 shares of common stock for

Business Segments: 

The Company is
currently organized by four segments which represent our operating
units: United States antimony operations, Mexican antimony
operations, precious metals recovery and United States zeolite
operations. 

The Madero smelter
and Puerto Blanco mill at the Company s Mexico operation
brings antimony up to an intermediate stage, which can be sold
directly or shipped to the United States operation for finishing
and sales at the Thompson Falls, Montana plant.  The
precious metals recovery plant is operated in conjunction with the
antimony processing plant at Thompson Falls, Montana. The Zeolite
operation produces Zeolite near Preston, Idaho. Almost all of the
sales of products from the United States antimony and Zeolite
operations are to customers in the United States.

Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial   Condition,
continued: 

Antimony  

Our antimony sales
were 658,915 pounds for Q3 of 2016, a decrease of 16,116 pounds
(8.9%) from sales of 675,031pounds in Q3 of 2015. 

Our revenues for Q3
of 2016 were less than our revenues in Q3 of 2015, primarily due to
the decrease in the price of antimony.  Gross antimony
revenue net of discount was $2,025,755 for Q3 of 2016, down
$716,091 (26.1%) from Q3 of 2015.  The decrease in
revenues was due to the decrease in the price of antimony metal
from $4.06 during the third quarter of 2015 to $3.07 in the third
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $0.99 per pound
(24.4%). 

The amount of metal
sold from Mexico was approximately 411,000 pounds for the third
quarter of 2016 compared to approximately 345,000 pounds sold for
the third quarter of 2015.  The increased sales from
Mexico for Q3 of 2016 versus Q3 of 2015 was primarily because all
furnaces at Madero were processing Australian concentrates in 2016,
and the Madero smelter was in a transition phase from Mexico raw
material to the Hillgrove raw material from Australia during
2015.  We anticipate continuing processing Australian
concentrates through the end of 2016. 

Our cost per pound
of antimony production has fallen in 2016 compared to 2105 due to
the following factors: 

1.    

   The cost of raw
materials has dropped significantly because the price is indexed to
the sale price  

2.    

   Realized savings
from natural gas instead of more expensive propane in
Mexico  

3.    

   Sharply reduced
propane costs in Montana  

4.    

   Lower costs of
operating in Mexico  

The largest
reduction in cost per pound will result when all Mexican operations
are on stream, and the holding costs are spread over real
production. The holding costs for Los Juarez, Wadley, Guadalupe,
and Soyatal have been substantial to date. 

The antimony
business will realize higher production and potentially better
operating margins as Mexican operations are brought up to planned
capacity. 

The cost of Mexican
production in the first six months and the second quarter of 2016
included all the holding costs for Los Juarez, 80% of the holding
costs for the Puerto Blanco mill, and the care and maintenance
costs for Wadley and Guadalupe whose product could not be smelted
due to lack of furnace capacity at Madero. 

Precious Metals  

For the first nine
months of 2016, USAC shipped $914,837 of gold and silver compared
to $365,388 for the same period of 2015, an increase of
163%.  This included gross revenue of $414,312 for
Hillgrove gold, of which $350,256 was paid to Hillgrove, for a net
precious metals revenue of $564,581 for the first nine months of
2016. 

The production of
gold and silver from the Los Juarez deposit in Queretaro, Mexico is
awaiting two leach circuit additions. The addition at Madero is
completed, and the equipment is built and installed. It is expected
to result in higher metallurgical recoveries of gold and silver
from the flotation concentrates.  The second addition
will involve a cyanide leach circuit at the flotation mill at
Puerto Blanco in Guanajuato to recover the remaining gold and
silver from the floatation tailings. The application for this
permit is in progress, and commencement of Los Juarez production
could proceed during the second half of 2017. The Company does not
claim any ore reserves for Los Juarez by definition of the SEC
standards.

ITEM
2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition,
continued: 

We have vast
experience mining and processing precious metals and we believe
that we are ready to embark on a very substantial mining program at
Los Juarez, Coahuila, Mexico. 

For most of 2015,
and until the end of the first quarter of 2016, the 15 small
rotating furnaces at Madero have been used to process Australian
concentrates and almost all of our Mexican production was put in
inventory.  The start up of the large rotating furnace
during November of 2015 has allowed us to process most of the
Hillgrove concentrates using that furnace, and starting in Q2 of
2016 our Mexican mine subsidiary started processing Mexican raw
material sourced from leased mines. 

The Australian
concentrates contain gold in the slag remaining after the
concentrates have been processed.  We are presently
processing this slag and recovering a gold dore (a mix of precious
metals).   At this time, the gold dore is taken to a
third party refiner, and we receive a processing fee and a 7.5%
sales commission on the recovered precious metals
value. 

The same process
being used to recover the gold from the Hillgrove slag will be used
to recover the precious metals from our Los Juarez
ore. 

Precious
Metals Production: 

ZEOLITE  

During Q3 of 2016,
BRZ sold 3,375 tons of zeolite, a decrease of 153 tons (4.3%) from
the same period in 2015. 

During the first
nine months of 2016, BRZ sold 7,315 tons of zeolite, an increase of
199 tons (1.9%) from the same period in 2015. 

During Q3 of 2016,
BRZ realized net income of $105,604 compared to a net income of
$132,058 for Q3 of 2015, a decrease of $26,454. 

BRZ realized a net
income of $235,912 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to
$267,309 for the same period of 2015.

2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial   Condition,
continued: 

For BRZ, EBITDA was
$395,912 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $435,309 for
the same period in 2015. 

BRZ has embarked on
a sales program with field representatives that have years of
experience in the agricultural field, which has resulted in new
orders.  We believe that this is the most cost effective
and fastest way to increase revenues and profits for
BRZ. 

Company-Wide  

For the third
quarter of 2016, we recognized a net loss of $385,567 on sales of
$2,846,699, compared to a net loss of $135,890 in the third quarter
of 2015 on sales of $3,505,452. The profit of $106,376 for the
first nine months of 2015 was primarily due to a negotiated
adjustment of $914,967 to the Company s cost of raw
materials. The gain from the price adjustment has been reported as
other operating income in 2015.  The loss in the third
quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in the price of
antimony, from $4.06 in Q2 of 2015 to $3.07 in Q3 of 2016, a
decrease in the price of $0.99 per pound.  Although the
2016 prices are the lowest they have been in 7 years, our average
sale price of $3.07 for Q3 of 2016 was an increase of $0.26 over
the average sales price of $2.81 for Q2 of 2016. 

For the first nine
months of 2016, we reported a net loss of
$1,142,333.  For the same period of 2015, we reported a
net income of $106,376, primarily due to a negotiated adjustment of
$914,967 to the Company s cost of raw materials 

For the third
quarter of 2016, EBITDA was a negative $175,292, compared to EBITDA
of $86,485 for the same period of 2015. 

For the third
quarter of 2016, the non-operating general and administrative
expenses were $344,539 compared to $413,786 for the same period of
2015. 

The largest
impediments to profitability have been the decline in the price of
antimony from $8.11 per pound in April of 2011 to $2.27 per pound
in January of 2016, a 72% decrease, and  non-production
costs  in Mexico of $514,400 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, the
non-production costs were $156,849 and included the costs of mines
and mills in Mexico that have been idle due to a lack of furnaces
at the Madero smelter and the metallurgical problems with the Los
Juarez ore. 

The metallurgical
problems with the Los Juarez ore have been solved, and we will
process the ore presently in inventory as soon as we are permitted
and can complete construction of our leach circuit at the Puerto
Blanco mill.  It appears that we may have reached the end
of the price declines in antimony. 

Hillgrove has
suspended mining and operations in Australia, but they may restart
operations.  We estimate that we have enough antimony
concentrates from Hillgrove to run our large rotating furnace
through the end of 2016.  Hillgrove has given us
permission to use the large rotating furnaces and other furnaces
built for their use for our own production if they are unable to
supply us with concentrates. 

The Mexico
non-production costs for the three and nine months ending September
30, 2016, are primarily due to holding costs from inactivity at the
Los Juarez and Wadley mines and the Puerto Blanco
mill.  The loss of production at the Madero smelter from
metalurgical testing and experimenting with various production
methods and formulas contributed to non-production costs during the
first quarter of 2015.

   Our net loss for
the third quarter of 2016 was $386,547, which includes $210,275 for
depreciation and amortization, and $37,500 for directors 
compensation to be paid in stock.  

2.    

    USAC s
precious metals net revenue in the first nine months of 2016 was
$564,581 which was equivalent to approximately $0.25 per pound of
antimony sold.  

3.    

   During the first
six months of 2016, the board of directors were issued shares of
common stock with a value of $137,500 for their services in 2015,
and an accrual of $112,500 for compensation to board members
through September 30, 2016 was recorded.  

Los Juarez  

Our Los Juarez
property in Queretaro, Mexico exposes mineralization for
approximately 3.5 kilometers and for widths up to 1 kilometer.
Previously, the deposit had been reported as a layered deposit
(manto) up to 6 meters thick with silver and antimony. The property
has been abandoned by major mining companies unable to solve the
metallurgical problems. After 11 years and many millions of
dollars, USAC has reported that:  

1.    

   The property is
predominantly a gold property with substantial credits in silver
and minor credits in antimony.  

2.    

   The property is not
a manto deposit but a series of deep- seated silica- rich pipes
that carry the mineralization vertically for many meters and has
not been fully delineated along strike and at
depth.  

3.    

   The Company has
pilot tested every aspect of the project including the mining,
milling, and smelting, and believes it has solved the metallurgical
problems to produce a gold-silver-antimony
concentrate.  The Company will bring its Puerto Blanco100
ton per day pilot mill on stream after permitting a cyanide leach
plant at Puerto Blanco. The leach plant at our Madero smelter is
permitted, and is completed.

   We claim no
reserves for the mining property at Los Juarez per SEC
rules.

Financial Position  

Our net working
capital decreased by approximately $1.2M from December 31,
2015.  Our cash decreased by approximately $90,000 during
the same period.  The decrease in our net working capital
was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of
long-term debt, the accrual of the liability for Mexican income
tax, and expenditures of approximately $460,000 for capital outlay.
We have estimated commitments for construction and improvements,
including the final expenditures to finish building and installing
the Hillgrove furnaces and equipment at Madero, Mexico, of
approximately $150,000 over the next twelve months. The cash for
the Hillgrove capital improvements will come from the expected
refund of IVA taxes presently deposited with the Mexican tax
authorities, and from our internally generated
sources.  We believe that with our current cash balance,
along with the future cash flow from operations, we have adequate
liquid assets to meet these commitments and service our debt for
the next twelve months.  We have lines of credit of
$202,000 which have been drawn down by $100,000 at September 30,
2016.

EVALUATION OF
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our chief financial
officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as
of September 30, 2016.  It was determined that there were
material weaknesses affecting our disclosure controls and
procedures and, as a result of those weaknesses, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2016. These material weaknesses are as follows: 

20 

The Company lacks
proper segregation of duties. As with any company the size of ours,
the lack of segregation of duties is due to limited resources. The
president authorizes the majority of the expenditures and signs
checks.  

During our year-end
audit, our independent registered accountants discovered material
misstatements in our financial statements that required audit
adjustments.  

MANAGEMENT'S
REMEDIATION INITIATIVES 

We are aware of
these material weaknesses and have procedures to ensure that
independent review of material transactions is
performed.  We have internal control measures to mitigate
the lack of segregation of duties as follows: 

The CFO reviews all
bank reconciliations  

The CFO reviews all
material transactions for capital expenditures  

The CFO reviews all
period ending entries for preparation of financial statements,
including the calculation of inventory, depreciation, and
amortization  

The CFO reviews all
material entries for compliance with generally accepted accounting
principles prior to the annual audit and 10Q
filings  

The Company has a
formal capitalization policy  

In addition, we
consult with independent experts when complex transactions are
entered into.
