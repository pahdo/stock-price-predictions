  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1  -  
        ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     

SmartMetric, Inc. (the  Company  or  SmartMetric )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric s main product is a fingerprint sensor activated
card with a finger sensor onboard the card and a built-in rechargeable battery for portable biometric identification. This card
may be referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Datacard.  SmartMetric has completed development
of its card along with pre mass manufacturing cards but has not yet begun to mass manufacture the biometric fingerprint activated
cards. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and
with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management of the Company, the
accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments (which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary for
a fair presentation. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017. For further information, refer to the financial statements and the footnotes
thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 

Going Concern   

As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements the Company has sustained recurring losses of $295,451 and $376,652 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of $23,550,327 at September 30, 2016.   The Company has spent a substantial
portion of its time and capital resources in the development of its technology. 

There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to
raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management believes that the Company s capital
requirements will depend on many factors.  These factors include the final phase of development and mass production being
successful as well as product implementation and distribution. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded
liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 2  -  
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Principles of Consolidation   

The condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, SmartMetric Australia Pty. Ltd.  All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE 2  -  
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  On an ongoing basis,
the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to income taxes and contingencies.  The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
and other short-term investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Any amounts
of cash in financial institutions over FDIC insured limits exposes the Company to cash concentration risk. The Company had no cash
equivalents at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Research and Development   

The Company annually incurs costs on activities that
relate to research and development of new technology and products.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company has not recognized revenues to date.  The
Company anticipates recognizing revenue in accordance with the contracts it enters into for the sale and distribution of its products.

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 2  -  
        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)    

Accounts Receivable   

The Company will extend credit based on its evaluation
of the customers  financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.  Exposure to losses on receivables
is expected to vary by customer due to the financial condition of each customer.  The Company will monitor exposure to
credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses considered necessary under the circumstances.  The Company
has not recorded any receivables, and therefore no allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Uncertainty in Income Taxes   

GAAP requires the recognition and measurement of uncertain
income tax positions using a  more-likely-than-not  approach.   Management evaluates Company tax positions
on an annual basis and has determined that as of September 30, 2016 no accrual for uncertain income tax positions is necessary. 

The Company files income tax returns in the United States
( U.S. ) federal jurisdiction.  Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by
tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2012.  The Company does not file in any other jurisdiction and remains open
for audit for all tax years as the statute of limitations does not begin until the returns are filed. 

Advertising Costs   

The Company will expense the cost associated with advertising
as incurred. 

Equipment   

Equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 - 5 years. 

Loss Per Share of Common Stock   

Basic net loss per common share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share ( EPS )
includes consideration of dilution arising from common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock
options and warrants.  Common stock equivalents were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share on
the consolidated statement of operations due to the fact that the Company reported a net loss and to do so would be anti-dilutive
for the periods presented. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company measures expense for issuances of stock-based
compensation to employees and others at fair value of the stock and warrants issued, as this is more reliable than the fair value
of the services received complete. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional
paid-in capital.

NOTE 3  -  
        PREPAID EXPENSES     

Prepaid expenses represent the unexpired terms of various
consulting agreements as well as advance rental payments.  The Company issued common stock and warrants as consideration
for the consulting services, and were valued based on the stock price or computed warrant value at the time of the respective agreements.

Lease Agreement   

The Company s main office is located in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Rent expense under all leases for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,127 and $7,179, respectively. 

Related Party Transactions   

The Company s Chief Executive Officer has made
cash advances to the Company with an aggregate amount due of $22,300 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. These advances bear
interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum. 

The Company has accrued the amounts of $425,848 and $394,181
at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, as deferred Officer s salary, for the difference between the Chief
Executive Officer s annual salary and the amounts paid.

with the holders of the common stock. 

On December 11, 2009, the Company entered into an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement with ACI (the  assignment and Assumption Agreement ). In accordance with the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, ACI conveyed, assigned and transferred to the Company all of ACI s rights, title and interest in and

In consideration for the assignment of the Patent, the

In July 2013, ACI elected to convert 190,000 shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, issued in 2012, into 9,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 

During September 2013, the Company acquired license rights

Convertible Preferred Stock. Effective November 5, 2014, the Company increased the number of preferred shares designated as Series

In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB )
topic 5G  Transfers of Non-monetary Assets by Promoters and Shareholders  the Company recorded these transactions at
ACI s carrying basis of the Patents, which was $0.

Common Stock   

The Company was incorporated on December 18, 2002, with

of authorized shares to 100,000,000 shares, and in 2009 to increase the number of authorized shares to 200,000,000. As a result

2015 and December 31, 2015 that it increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to 300,000,000. On March 31, 2016,

Warrants   

From time to time the Company granted warrants in connection
with private placements of securities, as described herein. 

In October 2009, the Company
executed a warrant agreement with an investor relations company for 5,000,000 warrants to be issued in two tranches. The
first tranche of 2,500,000 warrants (the  October warrants ) has been issued in October 2009, and the second
tranche of 2,500,000 warrants   were on March 31, 2010 (the  March warrants ). The October warrants,
which were set to expire October 25, 2014 (as extended) but were further extended by the Company and expired on October
25, 2015. The March warrants, which were set to expire March 29, 2015 (as extended) but   were further extended by the
Company and expired on March 29, 2016. 

In July 2015, as consideration for
a consulting agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.01
per share. The warrants are fully vested and exercisable for five-years. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes
method with the following criteria: stock price of $0.14; volatility 150%; term 5 years; and risk-free rate of 1.71%. The criteria
yielded a per-warrant value of $0.14, resulting in a total value of $42,000 for the 300,000 warrants. The Company recorded the
charge to consulting expense over the three-month term of the consulting agreement. During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded a charge of $35,000 to consulting expense, which is included in other general and administrative expenses
in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

In April 2016, as partial consideration
for consulting services rendered, the Company authorized to be issued warrants to purchase 1 million shares of its common stock
at an exercise price of $0.03 per share ( $0.03 warrants ), and 2 million warrants to purchase shares of its common
stock at an exercise price of $0.08 per share ( $0.08 warrants ). The warrants are fully vested and exercisable for
three-years. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Sholes option pricing model with the following criteria: stock price
of $0.11; volatility 136%, term 3 years; and risk-free rate of 0.92%. The criteria yielded a per-warrant value of $0.10 for the
$0.03 warrants, and a per-warrant value of $0.09 for the $0.08 warrants, resulting in a total value of $280,000 for the 3 million
warrants. The expense has been included in other general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Overview  

SmartMetric, Inc. ( SmartMetric  or
the  Company ) was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric is a development stage
company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric has an issued patent covering technology that involves connection to networks
using data cards (smart cards and EMV cards). SmartMetric s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card
and security card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The cards with have a
rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric
card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card. 

The SmartMetric Biometric Technology And Products  

SmartMetric's founder, C. Hendrick is the originator
and inventor of various miniature biometric activated devices including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments
card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader inside the card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The
SmartMetric biometric payments card provides for high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication
and activation to the new EMV chip cards now in use around the World. More than 4.8 Billion EMV chip debit and credit cards are
now in use globally. The SmartMetric biometric payments card has been manufactured to be totally interoperable with the EMV chip
card readers and banking infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make it s biometric
credit/debit cards the Company has also turned its attention to creating a multi-functional biometric building access control and
logical network access card. 

SmartMetric has also turned its attention to creating
a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a persons medical files as well as assisting in fighting medical fraud
by using the card to provide in-card biometric identity validation. 

SmartMetric has developed its rechargeable battery
powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits  inside  a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder has
stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card the person swipes the fingerprint sensor, the sensor is connected
to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored
fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card has a surface mounted EMV chip as found
on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holders fingerprint has been scanned and verified using
the SmartMetric miniature  in-card  biometric scanner. 

There are over 4.8 billion EMV chip cards used
by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market
for its advanced security biometric activated card technology. SmartMetric plans to market its in-card biometric solution as a
replacement to the less secure password or PIN used in current cards to card issuing banks and financial institutions. 

SmartMetric has completed development of its biometric
card. The company is now presenting its card to major card issuing banks throughout the world. Following feedback from potential
Bank customers, SmartMetric has incorporated new changes into its card including an indicator light as well as an extended battery
life. On April 4th 2016, SmartMetric officially launched its card in Orlando, Florida, at the Smart Card Alliance Payments Forum
exhibition and conference. Much interest was shown by card issuing banks generating sales and marketing leads that the company
is following through with. 

SmartMetric is currently engaging sales representatives
who are now actively promoting the SmartMetric biometric chip card to banks and card issuers throughout Europe, the United Kingdom,
Asia and North America. After the completion of payments network testing and internal marketing trials by Banks and Financial Institutions
(card issuers) SmartMetric will then expect sales revenue to begin. 

Card issuers may take from 3 months up to 12 months
of internal trials and test marketing prior to placing orders of consequence with SmartMetric. While SmartMetric had created a
working card prior to this year, refinements to the cards hardware and embedded software were undertaken prior to the official
product launch in April, 2016. Further enhancements have been made following the input of some significant card issuing Banks. 

The SmartMetric biometric payments card, with a
built-in rechargeable battery and EMV banking industry contact interface chip (which activates following a fingerprint match on
the card), is the first of its kind in the world. 

IN CARD FINGERPRINT MATCHING AND VERIFICATION  

The SmartMetric Biometric card incorporates a rechargeable,
lithium polymer battery. This battery is rechargeable, very thin and has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric
fingerprint Credit Card sized card. This battery is manufactured by a third party to SmartMetric s specifications and is
unaffiliated with the Company. This battery is embedded inside the card. 

The Security Technology Industry 

SmartMetric Biometric Multi-Function Security Card 

SmartMetric has developed a multi-function logical
and physical access security card this size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utalizing the small size breakrthoughs by
the company in its biometric payments card development SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that can
easily fit inside a person s wallet. 

As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric
security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the cards internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint
scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user. 

Biometrics  

Biometric technologies identify users by electronically
capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature,
and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics,
positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization. 

We plan to market and sell our product to commercial
and banking interests in the private sector and governmental agencies. The company is now actively marketing its biometric EMV
chip card to Banks and Financial Institutions within the United States and Europe. The company also has sales representation in
Australia and sales and marketing discussions under way with Financial Institutions in the Far East and Asia. 

On April 4th 2016 SmartMetric officially launched
its biometric EMV chip card product at the Smart Card Alliance Payments Forum in Orlando, Florida. The company had exhibition space
in the main exhibition hall displaying and showing its biometric card. Discussions and contacts were made with some major card
issuers at this conference leading to ongoing sales and marketing discussions. 

The Company will be attending further industry
conferences and exhibitions as part of its ongoing sales and marketing efforts 

The Company contracts outside silicon and component
fabrication plants to manufacture specific components to SmartMetric s specifications. Creation of the sub-micro circuit
boards are outsourced, assembly of components on the board are also outsourced. The Company may also establish other card manufacturing
centers at different locations as and when required. Separate manufacturing centers have been engaged in order to make, assemble
and complete the finished SmartMetric biometric EMV chip card. Current production capacity is approximately 250,000 cards per week
and this can be substantially increased in co-ordination with our engaged manufacturing centers. 

Results of Operations  

Comparison of the Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue and Net Loss  

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, there was no revenue and a net loss of $295,451.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, there was
no revenue and a net loss of $376,652.  This decreased loss of $81,201 or 21.6% resulted primarily from lower general
and administrative expenses. 

General and
Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $196,106, a decrease of $71,928 or 26.8% compared to $268,034 for the comparable
period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributed to lower consulting expenses. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and development expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $51,845, a decrease of $9,273 or 15.2% compared to $61,118 for the comparable
period in 2015.   This decrease was primarily attributable to lower engineering expenses. 

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $0, unchanged from the comparable period in 2015. 

The Company is a development stage
company and has spent a majority of resources and time in developing its technology.  There is no guarantee that the
Company can continue to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations.  These conditions raise
a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company s
capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the final phase of product development and the development of
its production process as well as product implementation and distribution.  The consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amount and classification of recorded
liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of $23,550,327 and it is likely that the Company will incur additional losses in the future. While we
have funded our operations since inception from operations and through private placements of equity securities, there can be no
assurance that adequate financing will continue to be available to us and, if available, on terms that are favorable to us. 

We believe that we will require additional financing
to carry out our intended objectives during the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will
be available or, if it is available, that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will
be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. If we
are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

A downturn in the United States stock and debt markets
could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise
the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed
to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional
equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares of common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject
to restrictive covenants. There is a risk of dilution whenever the Company sells securities to raise capital. If additional financing
is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations. 

Cash   

Our cash balance was $49,142 at
September 30, 2016 compared with $138,823 at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower than usual amount
of shares sold for cash. 

Net cash used in operating
activities   

Net cash used in operating
activities was $268,633 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $77,728, or 40.7% from the comparable period
in 2015.  The Company is largely dependent on the capital it raises to fund operations.  When capital is raised
the development process is accelerated, and when cash flows are decreased the Company conserves its cash by delaying development
and other operating costs. 

Net cash used in investing
activities   

Net cash used in investing activities
was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unchanged from the comparable period in 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $178,952 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $4,687 or 2.7% from the comparable period in 2015.  This
increase was due to an increase in the liability for stock to be issued, partially offset by a decrease in sales of equity shares
in the period. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements.  

There were no off-balance sheet
arrangements at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. 

In connection with an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement with Applied Cryptography, Inc. ( ACI ), a corporation controlled by the Company s president
and the owner of certain technology, ACI conveyed, assigned and transferred to the Company all of ACI's rights, title and interest
in and to its patents (collectively, the  Patent ) and delegated to the Company all of its duties and obligations to
be performed under the Patent. 

In consideration for the assignment
of the Patent, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. ACI may only convert these shares into
common shares (in accordance with the conversion terms noted herein) upon delivering to the Company, a third party valuation of
the assigned Patent conducted by a nationally qualified accounting firm or IP law firm mutually agreed upon between the Company
and ACI, indicating that such Patent is valued at a minimum of $1,000,000. 

Critical accounting policies and estimates  

The condensed consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management
makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. 

Item 3.  
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Our exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investments; thus, fluctuations in interest rates would not have
a material impact on the fair value of these investments.  At September 30, 2016, we had $49,142 in cash.  A
hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in either short term or long term interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings
or loss, or the fair market value or cash flows of these instruments. 

Item 4.  
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain  disclosure controls
and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The
design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Based on this evaluation, as of
September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified for each report and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In order to correct the foregoing
deficiencies, we plan to take the following remediation measures: 

1) We have committed to the establishment
of effective internal audit functions, however, due to the limited resources of the Company and the limited operations, we plan
to defer the establishment of an effective internal audit function until our product is ready for production and sale. 

2) Due to our size and nature,
segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.  However, to the
extent possible, we will implement procedures to ensure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording
of transactions will be performed by capable individuals. 

We believe that the foregoing
steps will remediate the deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and
make any changes that our management deems appropriate. However, as of September 30, 2016, these steps have not
been completed. We have one independent director, Elizebath Ryba. 

A material weakness (within the
meaning of PCAOB auditing standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention
by those responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting. 

Our management is aware of the material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and has acknowledged the increased possibility of errors existing
in our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  The reportable conditions and other areas of internal control
over financial reporting identified by us as needing improvement have cause an increased possibility of a material misstatement
of our financial statements, however we are not aware of any instance where such reportable conditions or other identified areas
of weakness have resulted in a material misstatement or omission in any report we have filed with or submitted to the Commission.  Accordingly,
while we believe that our financial controls were ineffective, we do not believe there to be any material misstatements in our
financial statements at September 30, 2016. 

Limitations on Controls   

Management does not expect that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures or the Company's internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the Company have been detected.  The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives and the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  
       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

From
    time to time, the Company may be a plaintiff or defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our
    business. We know of no material, active, pending or threatened proceedings against us or our subsidiaries, nor are we, or
    any subsidiary, involved as a plaintiff or defendant in any material proceeding or pending litigation.   

Item 1A.  
       RISK FACTORS    

Not Applicable 

Item 2.  
       UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

The following summarizes the securities
that we sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016 without registering the securities under the Securities Act: 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company sold for cash 3,030,000 shares and warrants to purchase: (i) 1,893,750 shares at $0.70 per share, and (ii)
954,450 shares at $1.00 per share, for net proceeds of $151,016. The warrants expire at various times through January 15, 2018. 

Unless otherwise noted in this section,
with respect to the sale of unregistered securities referenced above, all transactions were exempt from registration pursuant to
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  1933 Act ), and Regulation S promulgated under the 1933
Act. In each instance, the purchaser had access to sufficient information regarding SmartMetric so as to make an informed investment
decision. More specifically, we had a reasonable basis to believe that each purchaser was an  accredited investor  and
otherwise had the requisite sophistication to make an investment in the Company s securities.
