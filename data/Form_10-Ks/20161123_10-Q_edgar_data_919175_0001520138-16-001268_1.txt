SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

In addition to historical information, this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are those that predict or describe
future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can generally identify forward-looking statements
as statements containing the words  believe,   expect,   will,   anticipate,   intend, 
 estimate,   project,   plan,   assume  or other similar expressions, or negatives of those
expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. All statements contained or incorporated
by reference in this quarterly report regarding our future strategy, future operations, projected financial position, estimated
future revenues, projected costs, future prospects, the future of our industry and results that might be obtained by pursuing management's
current plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. 

You should not place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable
factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available
to us and speak only as of the date on the cover of this quarterly report, or, in the case of forward-looking statements in documents
incorporated by reference, as of the date of the date of the filing of the document that includes the statement. New risks and
uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these matters or how they may affect us. Over time,
our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that
are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such difference might be significant and materially adverse to
our security holders. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to
publicly announce the results of any revisions to any statements to reflect new information or future events or developments. 

We have identified some of the important factors
that could cause future events to differ from our current expectations and they are described in this quarterly report under the
caption  Risk Factors,  below, and elsewhere in this quarterly report, which you should review carefully. Please consider
our forward-looking statements in light of those risks as you read this quarterly report.

Sugarmade, Inc. and Subsidiary  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements   

1. Nature of Business    

Sugarmade,
Inc. (hereinafter referred to as  we ,  us  or  the/our Company )
is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our previous legal name was Diversified Opportunities, Inc.
 Our Company, Sugarmade, Inc. operates through our subsidiary, Sugarmade, Inc., a California corporation ( SWC Group,
Inc., - CA ). As of the end of the reporting period, Sept 30, 2016, we were involved in several businesses including the
supply of products to the quick service restaurant sub-sector of the restaurant industry and as a distributor of paper products
derived from non-wood sources. We are headquartered in City of Industry, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, with two additional
warehouse locations in Southern California. As of date of this filing, we employ 21 full and part-time workers and contractors.  

Our
main business operation, CarryOutSuppies.com, is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies servicing more
than 3,000 quick service restaurants.   Our products include double poly paper cups for cold beverage; disposable, clear,
plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, food containers, soup containers, plastic
spoons and many other similar products for this market sector. CarryOutSupplies.com was founded in 2009 when the founders gained
first-hand experience within the restaurant industry of the difficulty for restaurant owners to acquire custom printed supplies
at a reasonable cost. Many quick service restaurants wish to acquire custom printed products, such as those embossed with logos,
but the minimum order size for such customization had been cost prohibitive. With that in mind, carry out supplies was founded
to provide products to this underserved section of the market. Since that time, the company has become a key supplier to many
popular U.S. franchises, particularly in the frozen dessert segments. The company estimates it holds approximately 40% market
share of generic and printed products within the take out frozen yogurt and ice cream industries. We also hold a product supply
and licensing agreement FreeHand  ThumbTray  for the western part of the United States.  

We
are also a distributor of paper made from 100% reclaimed sugarcane fiber, enhanced with bamboo. Sugarcane fiber, called bagasse,
is a discarded byproduct of sugarcane production. Sugarmade, Inc. was founded in 2010. As is explained below, in 2014, CarryOutSupplies.com
was acquired by Sugarmade, Inc., creating the Company as it is today. Relative to Sugarmade Paper, our third-party contract manufacturer
uses bagasse and bamboo, as opposed to wood products significantly reducing its manufacturing carbon footprint, energy consumption,
and attendant water pollution during the manufacture of its products. This allows us to offer our unique, exclusive, tree-free
paper products at price-parity equal to or less than current recycled fiber products already on the market. Our products are unique
and we believe offer an ideal solution for those consumers (both corporate and individual) seeking to meet their sustainability
mandates or personal environmentally conscious goals, at a price that is equal to or less than current recycled products. Our
primary focus for this business unit as of filing of this report is the organization and administration of fundraisers and paper
drives for schools, non-profits and other institutions.  

During
September of 2016, the Company completed negotiations for and signed a license agreement with HUY FONG FOODS, INC. ( HFFI ),
the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is granted license to use the licensed marks
of HFFI on and for products the Company is currently in process of designing and testing. Based on this agreement and a separate
license agreement signed during 2015 with Seasoning Stixs International, LLC, the Company plans to introduce a new culinary seasoning
product named Sriracha Seasoning Stixs. Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are encapsulated Huy Fong Sriracha Sauce and other seasonings
in the form of a stick, which are inserted into meat, fish and poultry prior to cooking. Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are a hard solid
at room temperature, but as heat is applied the sticks begin to liquefy allowing the meat fibers to act like a sponge absorbing
the seasonings and flavors that had previously been encapsulated in the stick. The Company plans to introduce this product via
a nationwide advertising and social media campaign during the December quarter of 2016.  

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies    

Basis of presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management's opinion
however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair
financial statement presentation. 

These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with our Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015,
which contains our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, for the period ended June 30, 2015, filed on or about August 6, 2016.
The interim results for the period ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. 

Principles of consolidation   

The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements include the accounts of our Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sugarmade-CA and SWC. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

(table of contents)    

Going concern   

The Company sustained continued losses
from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The
Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to
meet its obligations, in which it has not been successful, and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or
other sources, as may be required. 

Our   condensed
consolidated financial statements have   been   prepared 
 assuming that   we   will 
 continue as   a   going 
 concern. Such assumption contemplates the   realization of assets 
 and satisfaction of   liabilities in the normal course of business. These 
 condensed   consolidated   financial 
 statements   do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may 
 result should the Company   be unable   to
continue as   a going concern. 

Management is endeavoring to increase revenue-generating
operations. While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the Company s products, management is
also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including the sale of the Company s
equity and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms to our Company, or which may not be
available at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired
and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects
on us and/or our stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of
operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional
funds, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our common stock. 

Use of estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Revenue recognition   

We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) No. 605,  Revenue Recognition . Revenue
is recognized when an arrangement and a determinable fee occur, and when collection is considered to be probable and products are
delivered or title has been transferred. This generally occurs upon shipment of the merchandise, which is when legal transfer of
title occurs. In the event that final acceptance of our product by the customer is uncertain, revenue is deferred until all acceptance
criteria have been met. We currently have a consignment arrangement with two of our customers. We record revenue on consignment
goods when the consigned goods are sold by the consignee and all other above mentioned revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Cash deposits received in connection with the sales of our products prior to their being delivered or acceptance if applicable
is recorded as deferred revenue. 

Cash   

Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts
held as bank deposits and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. 

(table of contents)    

From time to time, we may maintain bank balances
in interest bearing accounts in excess of the $250,000 currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for interest
bearing accounts (there is currently no insurance limit for deposits in noninterest bearing accounts). We have not experienced
any losses with respect to cash. Management believes our Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to
its cash. 

Accounts receivable   

Accounts
receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We grant
unsecured credit to our customer s deemed credit worthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses
estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible,
the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company had accounts receivable net of allowances of $57,341
as of September 30, 2016 and of $117,866      as of June
30, 2016.       

Inventory   

Inventory consists of finished goods paper
and paper-based products such as paper cups and food containers ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. We
value our inventory using the weighted average costing method. Our Company's policy is to include as a part of inventory any freight
incurred to ship the product from our contract manufacturers to our warehouses. Outbound freights costs related to shipping costs
to our customers are considered period costs and reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. We regularly review
inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. 

If the estimated realizable value of our inventory
is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value. On a consolidated basis,
as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the balance for the inventory totaled $341,346 and $468,262, respectively. No amounts
were recognized as an obsolescence reserve at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

Income taxes   

We account for income taxes under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

As a result of the implementation of certain
provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
position, as defined, ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspect of the recognition and measurement
related to accounting for income taxes. We adopted the provisions of ASC 740 as of October 2, 2008, and have analyzed filing positions
in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as open tax years in these
jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and California as our  major  tax jurisdictions and generally, we
remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2013 U.S. federal income tax returns. However, we have certain tax
attribute carryforwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of
limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized. 

(table of contents)    

We believe that our income tax filing positions
and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial
position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did
not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated
with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes. We have no interest or penalties as of September
30, 2015. 

Stock based compensation   

Stock based compensation cost to employees
is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the stock-based award, and will be recognized as expense
over the employee s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate the fair value of employee
stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Model. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock
options will include the exercise price of the award, the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, the expected option
term, the risk free interest rate at the date of grant, the expected volatility and the expected annual dividend yield on our common
stock. We use our company s own data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected forfeiture
rate. Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the
services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. 

Loss per share   

We calculate basic earnings per share ( EPS )
by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without considering common
stock equivalents.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income or net loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents, such as options and warrants.
 Options and warrants are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive. 5,819,105  potential
     shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debts and 0 potential shares
issuable upon exercising of warrants were excluded in calculating diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30,
2016 due to the fact that issuance of the shares is anti-dilutive as a result of the Company s net loss 

Fair value of
financial instruments   

ASC Topic 820 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair
value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency
of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 - observable
inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

 Level 2 - include
other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 

 Level 3 - unobservable
inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 

The Company used Level 2 inputs for its valuation
methodology for the derivative liabilities in determining the fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumption inputs: 

(table of contents)    

Derivative instruments   

The fair
value of derivative instruments is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations under non-operating income (expense).  

(table of contents)    

Our Company
evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as
embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the
consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton
option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of
derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the
end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based
on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Refer to Note 6 for details.  

Segment Reporting  

FASB ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting ,
requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting.  The management approach   model
is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing
performance.  Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure,
or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company. 

FASB ASC Topic 280 has no effect on the Company s financial
statements as substantially all of its operations are conducted in one industry segment   paper and paper-based products
such as paper cups, cup lids, food containers, etc. 

New accounting pronouncements not yet
adopted   

In August
2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties

3. Concentration    

Customers   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015, our Company earned net revenues of $1,127,554 and $1,402,911 respectively. The vast majority of these revenues
for the period ending September 30, 2016 were derived from a large number of customers, whereas the vast majority of these revenues
for the period ending September 30, 2015 were derived from a limited number of customers. No customers accounted for over 10% of
the Company s total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2016. The revenues for the period ending September 30, 2015,
only reflect prior to the acquisition of SWC, and were revenues from Sugarmade, Inc. 

Suppliers   

For the three months end September 30, 2016,
we purchased products for sale by CarryOutSupplies from several contract manufacturers located in Asia. A substantial portion of
the Company s inventory is purchased from one supplier that functions as an independent foreign procurement agent. One supplier
accounted for 65%     and two suppliers each accounted for 8% of the Company s
total inventory purchase in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 respectively. 

4. Litigation    

From time to time and in the course of business,
we may become involved in various legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief. The amount of the ultimate liability,
if any, from such claims cannot be determined. As of June 30, 2015, there were no legal claims currently pending or threatened
against us that in the opinion of our management would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, as of the date of this filing, we were involved in the following legal proceedings. 

As of the date of this filing ,  the
Company is a plaintiff, in Contra Costa County, California, in a suit alleging breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to commit breach
of fiduciary duty, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, conversion, breach of contract, and interference with contractual relations
against, Diversified Products Group Inc. (DPG), Stephen Pinto, Lewis Cohen and Heidi Estiva, who were former sales agents for the
Company. Pinto is the Company s former Chairman of the board of directors. The Company plans to actively pursue this case.
During November of 2014, the Company received notice that a cross complaint had been filed against the Company. The complaint alleges
the parties were induced to make a series of investments in the Company by the material misrepresentations and omissions made by
the Company. The Company believes the allegations are without merit. The Company plans to vigorously defend against such claims.
No changes have occurred as of the filing date of this report. 

On May 24, 2014, the Labor Commissioner, State
of California issued an Order, Decision or Award of the Labor Commissioner against the Company in the amount of $56,365. On October
28, 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement, which was effective October 28, 2014, to resolve a judgment against
the Company via the issuance of 502,533 restricted shares and a $30,000 cash payment. 

(table of contents)    

On December 11, 2013, the Company was served
with a complaint from two Convertible Note Holders and investors in the Company, Lovitt   Hannan, Inc. Salary Deferral Plan
FBO J. Thomas Hannan, Attorney at Law 401K Plan and Trust, and Kevin M. Kearney. The Company s former CEO, Scott Lantz, was
also named in the suit. The complaint alleges Hannan was induced to make a series of investments in the Company by the material
misrepresentations and omissions made by the Company. We believe the Hannan case is now in the middle of depositions and it appears
a trial is scheduled, tentatively, in the second quarter of 2017. We believe the claims in that case are still primarily of two
categories, the first being repayment of the promissory notes and a series of allegations about improper investment solicitations
and other misrepresentations. We believe the Company s exposure to the claim concerning the Notes may be approximately $125,000.
We also believe there could be some associated legal fees, but we do not believe this amount will be material. 

There can be no assurances the ultimate liability
relative to these law suits will not exceed what is outlined above. 

5.     Convertible Notes    

As of September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016 the balance owing on convertible notes was $365,000 and 394,167 respectively. The convertible promissory notes
must be repaid by our Company within six months from the date of issuance; accrue interest at the rate of 14%; and are subject
to conversion at the election of the investors at such time as our Company has raised a minimum of $500,000 in a subsequent equity
financing. The conversion price will be the lower of 80% of the per share purchase price paid for by the new investors in the subsequent
financing, or $0.50 per share. Unless these promissory notes are converted or repaid earlier, our Company must pay the note-holders
the amount of the then accrued interest on the three, six, and nine month anniversaries of the issue date. As of September 30,
2016, two convertible promissory in the amount of $29,167 with accrued interest $13,596.28, was converted to 1,503,928 restricted
common shares.

common stock at $0.50 per share, and two-year warrants purchasing up to a total of 81,250 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share.
For purposes of accounting for the detachable warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes, the fair value of the warrants
was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The value of all warrants granted at the date of issuance
totaled $508,413 and was recorded as a discount to the notes payable. The amount will be amortized over the nine month term of
the respective convertible note as additional interest expense. 

On various dates during June 2014 and
December 2014 the Company and holders of certain convertible notes agreed to cancel warrants to purchase common shares in the company
and to extend the due dates on the Notes to July 1, 2016. $0.50 warrants and  Bonus Warrants  priced at $0.01, as defined

Item 8. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure  

On November 2, 2015, the Company dismissed
its independent registered public accounting firm, MJF   Associates, APC. The Registrant s Board of Directors made the
decision to dismiss MJF   Associates, APC and engage Anton   Chia, LLC. as Registrant s independent registered public
accounting firm, as described below. During Registrant s two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period before
such dismissal, there were no substantial disagreements with MJF   Associates, APC on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which remain unresolved. On November 2, 2015 the Registrant
engaged Anton   Chia, LLC. as Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm. 

On November 11, 2014, the Company dismissed
its independent registered public accounting firm, Anton   Chia, LLC. The Registrant s Board of Directors made the decision
to dismiss Anton   Chia, LLC and engage MJF   Associates, APC as Registrant s independent registered public accounting
firm, as described below. During Registrant s two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period before such
dismissal, there were no substantial disagreements with Anton   Chia, LLC on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which remain unresolved. On November 11, 2014 the Registrant engaged
MJF   Associates, APC as Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm. 

On July 20, 2011, our Company engaged Anton
  Chia, LLP ( A C ) as its independent registered public accounting firm effective July 20, 2011.  The
decision to engage A C was approved by our Company s audit committee.  A C previously audited the financial
statements of our wholly owned subsidiary Sugarmade, Inc. (incorporated in California    Sugarmade-CA )
as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period March 2, 2009 (inception) to December
31, 2009.   

Michael Cronin, Certified Public Accountant
was the independent registered public accountant of Diversified Opportunities, Inc. and resigned as the independent registered
public accountant effective July 20, 2011.  The reports of Mr. Cronin on our Company s consolidated financial statements
for the past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope, or accounting principles, other than to state that there is substantial doubt as to the ability of our Company to
continue as a going concern. 

 During our Company s two most recent
fiscal years and the subsequent interim period up to the resignation of Mr. Cronin, there have not been any disagreements between
our Company and Mr. Cronin, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope
or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mr. Cronin would have caused Mr. Cronin to make reference
thereto in its reports on our Company s audited financial statements.

ITEM 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This discussion and analysis may include statements
regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources. Such statements, along with
any other non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). We do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Our actual results may differ materially
from those contained in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q. See  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  above. 

The Company s primary business, via its
CarryOutSupplies.com business operation, is providing custom and generic printed supplies for the quick service sector of the restaurant
industry, with an emphasis on yogurt and ice cream establishments. Many of these establishments are underserved by the larger suppliers
that usually require restaurant customers to order large quantities of custom and generic printed paper and other products. CarrryOutSupplies
allows these smaller establishments to gain the marketing and advertising benefits of customized printed products without tying
up large amounts of working capital. 

The Company is in process of significantly
increasing the number of products offered to the restaurant industry. Whereas the current product emphasis is limited mainly to
custom and generic printed items, a new division of the Company, called CaliRestaurantSupplies.com, will expand both the number
of products offered and the target market for the Company. The Company already services approximately 2,500 takeout establishments,
restaurants, and other food service operators via a product offering of approximately 2,000 items. CaliRestaurantSupplies will
expand the Company s target market to include virtually every type of restaurant and institutional food service operation
and the scope of products offered to include virtually every type of non-food product purchased by restaurants. The Company plans
to offer over 6,000 products by mid-calendar 2016 and over 20,000 products by year-end via its CailRestaurantSupplies.com website. 

The Company s is also a distributor printer
and copier paper derived from non-wood sources via its Sugamade Paper product. Third party contract manufacturers use agricultural
residuals, namely bagasse (derived from sugar cane) and bamboo, as opposed to wood products, significantly reducing the manufacturing
carbon footprint, energy consumption, and attendant water pollution during the manufacture of its products. This allows us to offer
our unique, exclusive, tree-free paper products at price-parity equal to or less than current recycled fiber products already on
the market. Our products are unique and we believe offer an ideal solution for those consumers (both corporate and individual)
seeking to meet their sustainability mandates or personal environmentally conscious goals, at a price that is equal to or less
than current recycled products. The Company markets this tree free paper product via school and organization fund-raisers and directly
to corporations and institutions. 

In October of 2014, Sugarmade entered into an agreement to acquire
City of Industry, California based S W C Group, Inc., a California Corporation, which does business as CarryOutSupplies.com. 

Employees and consultants  

The company employees approximately 21 full-time and part-time workers,
and consultants, most of whom work within the City of Industry headquarters location.

Overview and Financial Condition   

Discussions with respect to our Company s
operations included herein refer to our operating subsidiary, Sugarmade-CA. Our Company purchased Sugarmade-CA on May 9, 2011.
As of the date of this filing, we had no other operations other than those of Sugarmade-CA. Information with respect to our Company s
nominal operations prior to the Sugarmade Acquisition is not included herein. 

Results of Operations  

The following table sets forth the results of our operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. 

Revenues 

For the three-month periods ending September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, revenues were $1,127,554 and $1,402,911, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a refocus
on the types of products sold by the Company, specifically elimination of low gross margin and unprofitable product lines and a
renewed focus on higher growth and higher gross margin products. 

Cost of goods sold 

For the three-month periods ending September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, costs of goods sold were $699,651 and $928,659 respectively. The decrease was primarily due to
a refocus on the types of products sold by the Company, specifically elimination of low gross margin and unprofitable product lines
and a renewed focus on higher growth and higher gross margin products. 

Gross profit 

For the three months period ending September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, gross profit were $427,903 and $474,252, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a refocus
on the types of products sold by the Company, specifically elimination of low gross margin and unprofitable product lines and a
renewed focus on higher growth and higher gross margin products. While this resulted in a decrease in the overall gross profit,
the change in business focus result in a significantly higher gross margin percentage of revenues. 

(table of contents)    

Operating expenses 

For the three-month periods ending September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, operating expenses were $489,495 and $701,909, respectively. The decrease was primarily due the
normalizing of business functions due to the acquisition of SWC Group, dba CarryOutSupplies.com outlined in Note 19, and cost cutting
programs implemented by management during the period. 

Other non-operating income expense. 

The Company had total other non-operating income
of $202,789 and a loss of $522,568 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease
was primarily due the normalizing of business functions due to the acquisition of SWC Group, dba CarryOutSupplies.com outlined
in Note 19, and the significantly lower charges related to the accounting for derivative liabilities. 

Net income (loss) 

Net income totaled $141,197 for the three month
period ending September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss totaling $750,225 for the three-month period ending September 30, 2015.
The decrease was primarily due the normalizing of business functions due to the acquisition of SWC Group, dba CarryOutSupplies.com
outlined in Note 19, the refocus on higher margin product lines and cost cutting programs implemented by management during the
period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have primarily financed our operations through
the sale of unregistered equity and convertible notes payable. As of September 30, 2016, our Company had cash balance of $14,422,
current assets totaling $545,477 and total assets of $636,263. We had current and total liabilities totaling $3,678,559. Stockholders 
equity reflected a deficit of $3,042,296     

The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of
the indicated types of activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net cash used in operating activities was $296,834
for the three months ending September 30, 2016, and $373,230 for the three months ending September 30, 2015. The decrease of net
cash flows used in operating activities was primarily due to the normalizing of business functions due to the acquisition of SWC
Group, dba CarryOutSupplies.com outlined in Note 19 and due to the elimination of acquisition and restructuring expenses incurred
during the September 30, 2014 period. 

No cash was generated during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 relating to investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $7,677 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

(table of contents)    

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$310,345 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $333,562 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The difference was due to increased sales of equities during the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Our capital requirements going forward will
consist of financing our operations until we are able to reach a level of revenues and gross margins adequate to equal or exceed
our ongoing operating expenses. Other than the notes payable discussed above, borrowings from our bank and the production credit
facility with our suppliers, we do not have any credit agreement or source of liquidity immediately available to us. 

Given estimates of our Company s future
operating results and our credit arrangements with our suppliers, we are currently forecasting that we will need to secure additional
financing to obtain adequate financial resources to reach profitability. As of the date of this report, we estimate that the cash
necessary to implement our current business plan for the next twelve months is approximately $2,000,000. 

Based on our need to raise additional funds
to implement our business plans for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion concerning the presentation of our financial
statements on a going concern basis in the notes to our financial statements and our independent public accountants have included
a similar discussion in their opinion on our financial statements through June 30, 2016.    
We will be required in the near future to issue debt or sell our Company s equity securities in order to raise additional
cash, although there are no firm arrangements in place for any such financing at this time. We cannot provide any assurances as
to whether we will be able to secure the necessary financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur.
The failure to secure such financing could severely curtail our plans for future growth or in more severe scenarios, the continued
operations of our Company. 

Capital Expenditures   

Our current plans do not call for our Company
to expend significant amounts for capital expenditures for the foreseeable future beyond relatively insignificant expenditures
for office furniture and information technology related equipment as we add employees to our Company. We are however continually
evaluating the production processes of our third party contract manufacturers to determine if there are investments we could make
in their processes to achieve manufacturing improvements and significant cost savings. Any such desired investments would require
additional cash above our current forecast requirements.

Assumptions

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

Intentionally omitted pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K. 

(table of contents)    

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange
Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching
a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives. 

As required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the
foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls
and procedures were ineffective due to the Company is relatively inexperienced with certain complexities within USGAAP and SEC
reporting. 

We have taken, and are
continuing to take, certain actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We plan to
hire additional credentialed professional staff and consulting professionals with greater knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP
and related regulatory requirements to oversee our financial reporting process in order to ensure our compliance with U.S. GAAP
and other relevant securities laws. In addition, we plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on U.S. GAAP,
and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements. 

Notwithstanding the above
identified material weakness, the Company s management believes that its condensed consolidated financial statements included
in this report fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There have not been any
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
