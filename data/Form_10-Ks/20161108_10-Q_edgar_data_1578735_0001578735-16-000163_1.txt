  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

1. Basis of Reporting 
    
  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National General Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries (the  Company  or  NGHC ) and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP  or  U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , previously filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016  . The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and the audited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , also include the accounts and operations of Adirondack Insurance Exchange, a New York reciprocal insurer, and New Jersey Skylands Insurance Association, a New Jersey reciprocal insurer (together with their subsidiaries, the  Reciprocal Exchanges  or "Exchanges"). The unaudited condensed financial statements   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   excludes the accounts and operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges, from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016, as these entities did not meet the criteria for consolidation under FASB ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis," during that period but met the criteria on March 31, 2016. As discussed in Note 2,  Recent Accounting Pronouncements,  ASU 2015-02 was adopted using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2016. As a result, periods prior to the adoption were not impacted by the deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  The Company does not own the Reciprocal Exchanges but manages their business operations through its wholly-owned management companies. 
    
  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative, if annualized, of those to be expected for the full year. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  A detailed description of the Company s significant accounting policies and management judgments is located in the audited consolidated financial statements, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC. 
    
  All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  With the exception of those discussed below, there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to those described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company. 
    
  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, "Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)", to reduce diversity in practice in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. The amendments in ASU 2014-16 do not change the current criteria in GAAP for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. An entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. ASU 2014-16 clarifies how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, ASU 2014-16 clarifies that an entity should consider all

    NATIONAL GENERAL HOLDINGS CORP. 
    
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

relevant terms and features-including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation-in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, ASU 2014-16 clarifies that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2014-16 clarify that, in evaluating the nature of a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features (that is, the relative strength of the debt-like or equity-like terms and features given the facts and circumstances) when considering how to weight those terms and features. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in ASU 2014-16 are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. The amendments in ASU 2014-16 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2014-16 on January 1, 2016 and the implementation of the standard did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, "Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) (simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items) , as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. ASU No. 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Previously, an event or transaction was presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. If an event or transaction met the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity was required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also was required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. An entity has a choice of transition methods. It may apply the amendments in ASU 2015-01 either prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The amendments in ASU 2015-01 are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. An entity has the option to adopt the changes earlier provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2015-01 prospectively on January 1, 2016 and the implementation of the standard did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" to address concerns that GAAP might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entity's contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity's voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity's economic benefits or obligations. Specifically, the amendments: (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities; (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 amends certain areas in the consolidation analysis including: (i) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; (ii) the evaluation of fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (iii) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; and (iv) certain investment funds. The amendments in ASU 2015-02 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 required the Company to evaluate whether its VIEs met the amended criteria for consolidation at the earliest date of involvement unless certain reconsideration events existed. The Reciprocal Exchanges were evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that existed in September 2014 when the Company acquired the managing entities for the Reciprocal Exchanges. As a result of the evaluation, the Company was not required to consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges as of January 1, 2016 (the Reciprocal Exchanges had previously been included in the Company s consolidated results). The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2016. The total NGHC stockholders  equity was not affected by this change. On March 31, 2016, the Company purchased the surplus notes representing the obligation of the Reciprocal Exchanges from a related party for consideration of   $88,900  . (See Note 3, "Reciprocal Exchanges" for additional information). The Company has significant economic interest in the Reciprocal Exchanges due to its ownership of the surplus notes. In addition, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, earns fees from the Reciprocal Exchanges that are variable interests. The Company is the primary beneficiary because it, through its wholly-owned management companies, has both the power to direct the activities of the Reciprocal Exchanges that most significantly impact their economic performance and the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary that holds the surplus notes, would absorb

  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

more than an insignificant amount of expected losses or residual returns of the Reciprocal Exchanges. Therefore, the Company was required to consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges at March 31, 2016. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)", which provides guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient as well as limits certain disclosure requirements only to investments for which the entity elects to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and should be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-07 on January 1, 2016 and the implementation of the standard did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" which applies to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The only disclosures required at transition will be the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. An entity should disclose that information in the first annual period of adoption and in the interim periods within the first annual period if there is a measurement-period adjustment during the first annual period in which the changes are effective. The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016 and the effects of adoption will be limited to disclosures relating to adjustments for acquisitions to provisional amounts when identified during the measurement period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The implementation of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" to provide users of financial statements with more useful information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities and make targeted improvements to existing GAAP by: (1) requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer; (2) simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; (3) eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (4) eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (5) requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (6) requiring an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income ("OCI") the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as "own credit") when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (7) requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (8) clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the following provisions in ASU 2016-01 is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year

  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

of adoption: (i) the "own credit" provision, in which an organization should present separately in OCI the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; and (ii) the provision that exempts entities that are not public business entities from the requirement to apply the fair value of financial instruments disclosure guidance. Except for the early application guidance discussed above, early adoption of the amendments in ASU 2016-01 is not permitted. The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company currently records equity securities, available-for-sale, at fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1,248   and   $(3,909)  , respectively, of net unrealized gains (losses), net of tax, for equity securities, available-for-sale, recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)  to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures and is currently unable to estimate the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, "Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting" as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2016-07 require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. No additional disclosures are required at transition. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations", which improves the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by clarifying that: 1) an entity determines whether it is a principal or an agent for each specific good or service promised to the customer; 2) an entity determines the nature of each specific good or service; 3) when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity that is a principal obtains control of (a) a good or another asset from the other party that it then transfers to the customer; (b) a right to a service that will be performed by another party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity's behalf, or (c) a good or service from the other party that it combines with other goods or services to provide the specific good or service to the customer; and 4) the purpose of the indicators in paragraph 606-10-55-39 in Topic 606 is to support or assist in the assessment of control. The effective date and transition requirement for ASU 2016-08 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09, which were deferred to the quarter ending March 31, 2018 by ASU 2015-14. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax

  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Specifically, the amendments require: (1) All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period; (2) Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity; (3) An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur; (4) The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions; and (5) Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, and forfeitures, should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures and is currently unable to estimate the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing", which sought to address certain issues identified in the guidance on identifying performance obligation and licensing by reducing the potential for diversity in practice at initial application and the cost and complexity of applying the guidance in Topic 606 both at transition and on an ongoing basis as noted: 1) identifying performance obligations (a) when identifying performance obligations, whether it is necessary to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract; (b) determining whether promised goods and services are separately identifiable (that is, distinct within the context of the contract); (c) determining whether shipping and handling activities are a promised service in a contract or are activities to fulfill an entity s other promises in the contract; (2) licensing; (a) determining whether the nature of an entity s promise in granting a license is to provide a right to access the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied over time and for which revenue is recognized over time, or to provide a right to use the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied at a point in time and for which revenue is recognized at a point in time; (b) the scope and applicability of the guidance about when to recognize revenue for sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property; (c) distinguishing contractual provisions that require an entity to transfer additional licenses (that is, rights to use or access intellectual property) to a customer from contractual provisions that define the attributes of a promised license (for example, restrictions of time, geographical region, or use). The effective date and transition requirement for ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09, which were deferred to the quarter ending March 31, 2018 by ASU 2015-14. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients", which sought to address certain issues identified in the guidance by reducing the potential for diversity in practice at initial application and the cost and complexity of applying the guidance in Topic 606 both at transition and on an ongoing basis as noted: 1) assessing the collectibility criterion in paragraph 606-10-25-1(e) and accounting for contracts that do not meet the criteria for Step 1 (applying paragraph 606-10-25-7), the amendments in ASU 2016-12 clarify the objective of the collectibility criterion in Step 1. The objective of this assessment is to determine whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis of whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 also add a new criterion to paragraph 606-10-25-7 to clarify when revenue would be recognized for a contract that fails to meet the criteria in Step 1. That criterion allows an entity to recognize revenue in the amount of consideration received when the entity has transferred control of the goods or services, the entity has stopped transferring goods or services (if applicable) and has no obligation under the contract to transfer additional goods or services, and the consideration received from the customer is nonrefundable; 2) presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction

price; 3) noncash consideration, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception and clarify that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration; 4) contract modifications at transition, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented in accordance with the guidance in Topic 606 when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; 5) completed contracts at transition, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts; 6) technical correction, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition requirement for ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09, which were deferred to the quarter ending March 31, 2018 by ASU 2015-14. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Specifically, the amendments require, a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (PCD assets) that are measured at amortized cost basis is determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for these assets. Interest income for PCD assets should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Available-for-sale accounting recognizes that value may be realized either through collection of contractual cash flows or through sale of the security. Therefore, the amendments limit the amount of the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost because the classification as available for sale is premised on an investment strategy that recognizes that the investment could be sold at fair value, if cash collection would result in the realization of an amount less than fair value. The allowance for credit losses for purchased available-for-sale securities with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination is determined in a similar manner to other available-for-sale debt securities; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in credit loss expense. Interest income should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-13 earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply the amendments in ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The effect of a prospective transition approach is to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the effective date of ASU 2016-13. Amounts previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the date of adoption that relate to improvements in cash flows expected to be collected should continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the asset. Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements

in cash flows after the date of adoption should be recorded in earnings when received. The Financial Accounting Standards Board determined that financial assets for which the guidance in Subtopic 310-30, Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, has previously been applied should prospectively apply the guidance in ASU 2016-13 for PCD assets. A prospective transition approach should be used for PCD assets where upon adoption, the amortized cost basis should be adjusted to reflect the addition of the allowance for credit losses. This transition relief will avoid the need for a reporting entity to reassess its purchased financial assets that exist as of the date of adoption to determine whether they would have met at acquisition the new criteria of more-than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. The transition relief also will allow an entity to accrete the remaining noncredit discount (based on the revised amortized cost basis) into interest income at the effective interest rate at the adoption date of ASU 2016-13. The same transition requirements should be applied to beneficial interests that previously applied Subtopic 310-30 or have a significant difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures and is currently unable to estimate the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow classification issues: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues. The amendments of ASU 2016-15 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which allows an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of ASU 2016-16 are intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 do not include new disclosure requirements; however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

3. Reciprocal Exchanges 
    
  As of September 15  , 2014, t  hrough its wholly-owned management companies, the Company manages the business operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and has the ability to direct their activities. The Reciprocal Exchanges are insurance carriers organized as unincorporated associations. Each policyholder insured by the Reciprocal Exchanges shares risk with the other policyholders. 
    
  In the event of dissolution, policyholders would share any residual unassigned surplus in the same proportion as the amount of insurance purchased but are not subject to assessment for any deficit in unassigned surplus of the Reciprocal Exchanges. The Company receives management fee income for the services provided to the Reciprocal Exchanges. The assets of the Reciprocal Exchanges can be used only to settle the obligations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and general creditors to their liabilities have no recourse to the Company. 
    
  Effective March 31, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company, purchased from subsidiaries of ACP Re Ltd. ("ACP Re"), a related party, the surplus notes that were issued by the Reciprocal Exchanges when they were originally capitalized. The purchase price of   $88,900   was based on an independent third party valuation of the fair market value of the surplus notes. The obligation to repay principal and interest on the surplus notes is subordinated to the Reciprocal Exchanges  other liabilities including obligations to policyholders and claimants for benefits under insurance policies. Principal and interest on the surplus notes are payable only with regulatory approval. The Company has no ownership interest in the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  Under ASU 2015-02, as a result of the Company's purchase of the surplus notes effective March 31, 2016, the Company determined that it holds a variable interest in each of the Reciprocal Exchanges. The Company would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the Reciprocal Exchanges expected losses or residual returns through its ownership of the surplus notes. In addition, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, earns fees from the Reciprocal Exchanges that are variable interests. Each of the Reciprocal Exchanges qualifies as a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") because they do not have sufficient equity to finance their operations without the surplus notes. The policyholders of the Reciprocal Exchanges lack the ability to direct the activities of the Reciprocal Exchanges that have a significant impact on the Reciprocal Exchanges' economic performance. The Company is the primary beneficiary because it, through its wholly-owned management companies, has both the power to direct the activities of the Reciprocal Exchanges that most significantly impact their economic performance and the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary that holds surplus notes, would absorb more than an insignificant amount of expected losses or residual returns of the Reciprocal Exchanges. Accordingly, the Company consolidates these Reciprocal Exchanges as of March 31, 2016 and for the periods thereafter, and eliminates all intercompany balances and transactions with the Company. 
    
  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, the Company consolidated the Reciprocal Exchanges under the previous guidance. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-02, on January 1, 2016, and before the purchase of the surplus notes, the Company did not meet the requirements for consolidation as it did not hold a variable interest in the Reciprocal Exchanges. Therefore, the operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges for the period from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016 are not included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

The following table presents the opening balance sheet of the Reciprocal Exchanges as of March 31, 2016: 

The consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges at March 31, 2016 is treated as a business combination with the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest recognized at fair value at the date of consolidation. The Company has no ownership in the Reciprocal Exchanges. Therefore, the difference between the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired represents the fair value of non-controlling interest acquired. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Reciprocal Exchanges recognized total revenues, total expenses and net income of   $52,829  ,   $49,856   and   $2,973  , respectively.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Reciprocal Exchanges recognized total revenues, total expenses and net income of   $107,350  ,   $95,153   and   $12,197  , respectively.   For the three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Reciprocal Exchanges recognized total revenues, total expenses and net income of   $52,498  ,   $50,934   and   $1,564  , respectively.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Reciprocal Exchanges recognized total revenues, total expenses and net loss of   $136,702  ,   $137,223   and   $(521)  , respectively. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company earned service and fee income from the Reciprocal Exchanges in the amounts of   $11,334   and   $11,194  , respectively.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company earned service and fee income from the Reciprocal Exchanges in the amounts of   $31,731   and   $30,504  , respectively. Such amounts are eliminated in the Company's consolidated earnings, except for   $9,590   of service and fee income included in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , for the period in which the Company and the Reciprocal Exchanges did not meet requirements for consolidation.

There were   231   and   444   securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that account for the gross unrealized loss, none of which are deemed by the Company to be other-than-temporary impairments. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturities were primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates since their date of purchase. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that the unrealized losses on common stock were primarily due to continued weakness in the equities market. Significant factors influencing the Company s determination that none of these securities were OTTI included the length of time and/or magnitude of unrealized losses in relation to cost, the nature of the investment, the current financial condition of the issuer and its future prospects, the ability to recover to cost in the near term, and management s intent not to sell these securities and it being more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to the Company s cost basis. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , of the   $2,892   and   $10,355  , respectively, of unrealized losses related to securities in unrealized loss positions for a period of twelve or more consecutive months,   $467   and   $8,466  , respectively, of those unrealized losses were related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to   20%   of its amortized cost or cost. Those unrealized losses were evaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations. 
    
  The Company reviewed its investments at   September 30, 2016  , and determined that no additional OTTI existed in the gross unrealized holding losses other than certain fixed maturities and equity securities, that were in a loss position, for which the Company had the intention to sell before it can recover its cost basis. At   September 30, 2016   the Company intends to sell these securities. The impairment for these securities is equal to the difference between its amortized cost or cost and its fair value, and were as follows: 

The Company regularly monitors its investments that have fair values less than cost or amortized cost for signs of other-than-temporary impairment, an assessment that requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known. Such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could negatively impact the amounts reported. 
    
  Among the factors that management considers for fixed maturity securities are the financial condition of the issuer including receipt of scheduled principal and interest cash flows, and intent to sell, including if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery. When a fixed maturity has been determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment and the Company does not have the intention to sell, the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings as a realized loss, and the amount related to non-credit factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Future increases or decreases in fair value, if not other-than-temporary, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did   not   recognize any impairment charges due to credit loss for which a portion of the OTTI was recognized in AOCI. 
    
  The Company considers different factors to determine the amount of projected future cash flows and discounting methods for corporate bonds and residential and commercial mortgage-backed or structured securities. For corporate bond securities, the split between the credit and non-credit losses is driven principally by assumptions regarding the amount and timing of projected future cash flows. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company s best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. For residential and commercial mortgage-backed and structured securities, cash flow estimates, including prepayment assumptions, are based on data from widely accepted third-party data sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates, recoveries and changes in value. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company s best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security prior

  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

to impairment at the balance sheet date. The discounted cash flows become the new amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. 
    
  Among the factors that management considers for equity securities and other invested assets are the length of time and/or the significance of decline below cost, the Company s ability and intent to hold these securities through their recovery periods, the current financial condition of the issuer and its future business prospects, and the ability of the market value to recover to cost in the near term. When an equity security or other invested asset has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to fair value. This results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss, which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Future increases or decreases in fair value, if not other-than-temporary, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  (c) Unrealized Gains and Losses

  The Company had short-term investments of   $146,126   and   $3,527  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper issued by large banks and corporations, this commercial paper was rated by Standard   Poor s as A, A+ and A-. The increase from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was a result of the Company's issuance of preferred stock. 
    
  The table below summarizes the composition of other investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company s other investments consisted primarily of limited partnerships, having investments in residential and commercial real estate, real estate debt funds and preferred securities. The Company believes its exposure to risk associated with these investments is generally limited to the investment carrying amounts. The increase from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was to diversify the Company s alternative investment portfolio.

(j) Reverse Repurchase and Repurchase Agreements 
    
  The Company enters into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, which are accounted for as either collateralized lending or borrowing transactions and are recorded at contract amounts, which approximate fair value. For the collateralized borrowing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements), the Company receives cash or securities that it invests or holds in short-term or fixed income securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   collateralized lending transaction principal outstanding. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   collateralized borrowings transactions. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had collateralized borrowing transaction principal outstanding of   $52,484  , at interest rate of   0.80%  . Interest expense associated with these repurchase borrowing agreements   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $102   and   $422  , respectively, and   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $78   interest income and   $25   interest expense, respectively. The Company had   $55,394   of collateral pledged in support for these agreements as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The table below summarizes the remaining contractual maturity of the Company's repurchase agreements as of   December 31, 2015  . 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), at contract value are accounted for as collateralized borrowing transactions and are recorded at their contracted repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Under repurchase agreements, the Company borrows cash from a counterparty at an agreed-upon interest rate for an agreed-upon time frame and the Company transfers either corporate debt securities or U.S. government or government agency securities (pledged collateral). For securities repurchase agreements, the cash received is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturities, with the offsetting obligation to repay the loan included as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. At the end of the agreement, the counterparty returns the collateral to the Company, and the Company, in turn, repays the loan amount along with the agreed-upon interest. 
    
  There are potential risks associated with repurchase agreements and the related collateral pledged, including obligations arising from a decline in the market value of the collateral pledged. The Company is generally required to maintain collateral in the amount of   105.0%   to   110.0%   of the value of the securities the Company has sold with agreement to repurchase, which are subject to daily mark-to-market margining (i.e., if the collateral falls in value, a margin call can be triggered requiring the Company to pay cash or post extra securities to maintain the   105.0%   to   110.0%   threshold). Conversely, if the value of the Company s collateral pledged appreciates in value there is credit risk that the lending counterparty could default and not return/sell the securities back. 
    
  The Company minimizes the credit risk that counterparties might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring its counterparty exposure and related collateral pledged. Additionally, repurchase agreements are only transacted with pre-approved counterparties.

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies when GAAP requires or allows assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value; therefore, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstance. 
    
  The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately   100.0%   of its fixed maturities. For investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from nationally recognized third-party pricing services ( pricing services ). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value. This pricing method is used, primarily, for fixed maturities. The fair value estimates provided by the pricing service are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. If the Company determines that the fair value estimate provided by the pricing service does not represent fair value or if quoted market prices and an estimate from pricing services are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on dealer quotations of the bid price for recent activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued or through consensus pricing of a pricing service. Depending on the level of observable inputs, the Company will then determine if the estimate is in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Equity Securities     The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate the fair value of the majority of its available for sale and trading equity securities. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for equity securities that have quoted market prices in active markets and their respective quoted prices are provided as fair value. The Company classifies the values of these equity securities as Level 1. The pricing service also provides fair value estimates for certain equity securities whose fair value is based on observable market information rather than market quotes. The Company classifies the value of these equity securities as Level 2. From time to time, the Company also holds certain equity securities that are issued by privately-held entities or direct equity investments that do not have an active market. The Company estimates the fair value of these securities primarily based on inputs such as third party broker quote, issuers' book value, market multiples, and other inputs. These equity securities are classified as Level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation. 
    
  U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies     Comprised of primarily bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association. The fair values of U.S. government securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are included in the Level 1 fair value hierarchy. The Company believes the market for U.S. Treasury securities is an actively traded market given the high level of daily trading volume. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  States and Political Subdivision Bonds     Comprised of bonds and auction rate securities issued by U.S. state and municipal entities or agencies. The fair values of municipal bonds are generally priced by pricing services. The pricing services typically use spreads obtained from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used to price the municipal bonds are observable market inputs, these are classified within Level 2. Municipal auction rate securities are reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates their fair value. 
    
  Foreign Government     Comprised of bonds issued by foreign governments, and are generally priced by pricing services. As the significant inputs used to price foreign government bonds are observable market inputs, the fair values of foreign government bonds are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Corporate Bonds     Comprised of bonds issued by corporations and are generally priced by pricing services. The fair values of short-term corporate bonds are priced, by the pricing services, using the spread above the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") yield curve and the fair value of long-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. The spreads are sourced from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, the Company obtains non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. As the significant inputs used to price corporate bonds are observable market inputs, the fair values of corporate bonds are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy.

Mortgage, Asset-backed and Structured Securities     Comprised of commercial and residential mortgage-backed and structured securities. These securities are priced by independent pricing services and brokers. The pricing provider applies dealer quotes and other available trade information, prepayment speeds, yield curves and credit spreads to the valuation. As the significant inputs used to price are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Debt   - The amount reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for these financial instruments represents the carrying value of the debt. (See Note 10, "Debt" for additional information). 
    
  The Company's   7.625%   Notes are publicly traded and classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's   6.75%   Notes are not publicly traded and their fair value as of   September 30, 2016   was determined using market-based metrics and the magnitude and timing of contractual interest and principal payments. The fair value of the Company s   6.75%   Notes as of   December 31, 2015   was determined using the direct transaction method of the Market Approach. The Company executed an arm s length private market transaction in the   6.75%   Notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 which provided reasonably supportable indication of fair value for the   6.75%   Notes as of   December 31, 2015  . Non-direct market-based metrics and the magnitude and timing of contractual interest and principal payments were analyzed to support the indication of fair value provided by the direct transaction method of the Market Approach as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company's Imperial Surplus Notes, which are not publicly traded were valued using the Black-Derman-Toy interest rate lattice model. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Credit Agreement was determined using the discounted cash flow method. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Century-National Promissory Note was determined using the direct transaction method of the Market Approach. The Century-National Promissory Note is not a publicly traded instrument. The Company executed an arm s length private market transaction on June 1, 2016 which provided reasonably supportable indication of fair value for the Century-National Promissory Note as of   September 30, 2016   given the proximity to the valuation date. Non-direct market-based metrics and the magnitude and timing of contractual interest and principal payments were analyzed to support the indication of fair value provided by the direct transaction method of the Market Approach as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company's   6.75%   Notes, Imperial Surplus Notes, Credit Agreement, Century-National Promissory Note and Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Effective March 31, 2016, the Company purchased the Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes from ACP Re for an aggregate amount of approximately   $88,900  . The purchase price was based on an independent third party valuation of the fair market value of the surplus notes. At   September 30, 2016  , the surplus notes receivable and surplus notes payable are eliminated upon consolidation. (See Note 15, "Related Party Transactions" for additional information).

The following tables provide a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  : 

As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value measurement for the Company's ACP Re contingent payments of   $16,071   was valued based on discounted cash flows (see Note 15, "Related Party Transactions" for additional information). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value measurement for the Company's contingent payments related to the acquisition of Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. of   $2,677   and   $4,081  , respectively, and the contingent payments related to the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions Team, LLC of   $2,250   and   $4,500  , respectively, were valued based on estimated earnings and projected payouts. 
    
  There have not been any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, or Level 2 and Level 3, respectively, during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company transferred   $36,915   out of Level 3 and into Level 1 due to the public offering of a previously privately-placed common stock investment. The Company's policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of determination of fair value. 
    
  Other than Goodwill, the Company does not measure any assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Goodwill is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 8, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net" for additional information on how the Company tested goodwill for impairment. 
    
  The carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, premiums and other receivables, accrued investment income and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value given the short-term nature of such items and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the Company s securities sold under agreements to repurchase approximates fair value given the short-term nature of the agreements and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

6. Equity Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries 
    
  The Company has a   50%   ownership interest in each of three entities (collectively, the "LSC Entities") formed for the purpose of acquiring life settlement contracts, with AmTrust owning the remaining 50%. The LSC Entities are: Tiger Capital LLC ( Tiger  AMT Capital Alpha, LLC ( AMT Alpha  and AMT Capital Holdings, S.A. ( AMTCH  ). 
    
  A life settlement contract is a contract between the owner of a life insurance policy and a third party who obtains the ownership and beneficiary rights of the underlying life insurance policy. The Company, along with AmTrust, is obligated to pay premiums on these life insurance policies as they come due. A third party serves as the administrator for two of the life settlement contract portfolios, for which it receives an administrative fee. The third-party administrator is eligible to receive a percentage of profits after certain time and performance thresholds have been met. 
    
  Tiger, AMT Alpha and AMTCH (collectively  LSC Entities ) are considered to be VIEs, for which the Company is not a primary beneficiary. In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considered qualitative and

quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities. The Company does not have the ability to direct the activities of the LSC Entities that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company s maximum exposure to a loss as a result of its involvement with the unconsolidated VIE is limited to its recorded investment plus additional capital commitments. The Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for its investments in the LSC Entities. 
    
  The following tables present the investment activity in the LSC Entities. 

The following tables summarize total assets, total liabilities and members' equity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the results of operations for the Company s unconsolidated equity method investment in the LSC Entities   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

The LSC Entities account for investments in life settlements in accordance with ASC 325-30, "Investments in Insurance Contracts", which states that an investor shall elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts by using either the investment method or the fair value method. The election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. The LSC Entities have elected to account for these policies using the fair value method.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

The fair value of life settlement contracts as well as life settlement profit commission liability is based on information available to the LSC Entities at the end of the reporting period. The LSC Entities consider the following factors in their fair value estimates: cost at date of purchase, recent purchases and sales of similar investments (if available and applicable), financial standing of the issuer, changes in economic conditions affecting the issuer, maintenance cost, premiums, benefits, standard actuarially developed mortality tables and life expectancy reports prepared by nationally recognized and independent third party medical underwriters. The LSC Entities estimate the fair value of a life insurance policy by applying an investment discount rate based on the cost of funding their life settlement contracts as compared to returns on investments in asset classes with comparable credit quality, which the LSC Entities have determined to be   7.5%   to the expected cash flow generated by the policies in the life settlement portfolio (death benefits less premium payments), net of policy specific adjustments and reserves. In order to confirm the integrity of their calculation of fair value, the LSC Entities, quarterly, retain an independent third-party actuary to verify that the actuarial modeling used by the LSC Entities to determine fair value was performed correctly and that the valuation, as determined through the LSC Entities  actuarial modeling, is consistent with other methodologies. The LSC Entities consider this information in their assessment of the reasonableness of the life expectancy and discount rate inputs used in the valuation of these investments. 
    
  The LSC Entities adjust the standard mortality for each insured for the insured s life expectancy based on reviews of the insured s medical records and the independent life expectancy report based thereon. The LSC Entities establish policy specific reserves for the following uncertainties: improvements in mortality, the possibility that the high net worth individuals represented in their portfolios may have access to better health care, the volatility inherent in determining the life expectancy of insureds with significant reported health impairments and the future expenses related to the administration of the portfolio. The application of the investment discount rate to the expected cash flow generated by the portfolio, net of the policy specific reserves, yields the fair value of the portfolio. The effective discount rate reflects the relationship between the fair value and the expected cash flow gross of these reserves. 
    
  The following summarizes data utilized in estimating the fair value of the portfolio of life insurance policies as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and, only includes data for policies to which the LSC Entities assigned value at those dates: 

(1)       Standard life expectancy as adjusted for specific circumstances. 
   (2)     Effective Discount Rate ("EDR") is the LSC Entities' estimated internal rate of return on its life settlement contract portfolio and is determined from the gross expected cash flows and valuation of the portfolio. The valuation of the portfolio is calculated net of all reserves using a   7.5%   discount rate. The EDR is inclusive of the reserves and the gross expected cash flows of the portfolio. The LSC Entities anticipate that the EDR's range is between   12.5%   and   17.5%   and reflects the uncertainty that exists surrounding the information available as of the reporting date. As the accuracy and reliability of information improves (declines), the EDR will decrease (increase). 
    
  The LSC Entities' assumptions are, by their nature, inherently uncertain and the effect of changes in estimates may be significant. The fair value measurements used in estimating the present value calculation are derived from valuation techniques generally used in the industry that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data. The extent to which the fair value could reasonably vary in the near term has been quantified by evaluating the effect of changes in significant underlying assumptions used to estimate the fair value amount. If the life expectancies were increased or decreased by   4   months and the discount factors were increased or decreased by   1%   while all other variables were held constant, the carrying value of the investment in life insurance policies would increase or (decrease) by the unaudited amounts summarized below as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

(1)     Discount rate is a present value calculation that considers legal risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and is a component of EDR. 
    
  The Company and AmTrust are committed to providing additional capital support to the LSC Entities to keep the life settlement policies in-force. The Company and AmTrust, each, are committed to provide   50%   of the additional required capital. Below is a summary of total premiums to be paid for each of the five succeeding fiscal years to keep the existing life insurance policies in force as of   September 30, 2016  . The actual capital commitment may differ from the amounts shown based on policy lapses and terminations, death benefits received and other operating cash flows of the LSC Entities:

8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is calculated as the excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired. The Company performs an annual impairment analysis to identify potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. This annual test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently, if events or circumstances change in a way that requires the Company to perform the impairment analysis on an interim basis. Goodwill impairment testing requires an evaluation of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recorded if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit. 
    
  Intangible Assets 
    
  Intangible assets consist of finite and indefinite life assets. Finite life intangible assets include customer and producer relationships and trademarks. Insurance company licenses and managements contracts are considered indefinite life intangible assets subject to annual impairment testing.

The Company grants stock options at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company s stock on the dates the options are granted. The options have a maximum term of   ten   years from the date of grant and vest primarily in equal annual installments over a range of   one   to   five   years following the date of grant for employee options. If a participant s employment relationship ends, the participant s vested awards will remain exercisable for the shorter of a period of   30   days or the period ending on the latest date on which such award could have been exercisable. The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each grant date. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple-option pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The Company grants RSUs with a grant date value equal to the closing stock price of the Company s stock on the dates the units are granted and the RSUs generally vest over a period of   three   or   four   years.

  The following table summarizes service and fee income by category: 

14. Income Taxes 
    
  The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. The Reciprocal Exchanges are not included in the Company's consolidated tax return as the Company does not have an ownership interest in the Reciprocal Exchanges, and they are not a part of the consolidated tax sharing agreement. 
    
  The Company uses the estimated annual effective tax rate method as prescribed under ASC 740, "Income Taxes". Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit is reported in the same period as the related item. Certain tax effects are also not reflected in the estimated annual effective tax rate, primarily certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. 
    
  The Company establishes deferred tax liabilities equal to approximately   30%   of the unutilized statutory equalization reserves carried at its Luxembourg reinsurance companies. The deferred tax liability is adjusted each reporting period based primarily on amounts ceded to the Luxembourg reinsurer under the intercompany reinsurance agreements. As the income or loss of the Luxembourg entity is primarily from intercompany activity, the impact on the consolidated pre-tax income for the consolidated group is generally   zero  . Accordingly, the reduction of the deferred tax liability for the utilization of equalization reserves creates a deferred tax benefit reflected in the income tax provision in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. As there is no net effect on the consolidated pre-tax income from the intercompany reinsurance activity, the deferred tax benefit related to these transactions reduces the consolidated effective tax rate of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $9,604   and   $45,927  , respectively, of unutilized equalization reserves and an associated deferred tax liability of approximately   $2,881   and   $13,778  , respectively.

The following table is a reconciliation of the difference in the Company s income tax expense compared to the statutory rate of   35%  : 

The Company s consolidated effective tax rate   increased   by   6.6%   from   17.8%     for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   24.4%     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was primarily driven by a decrease in the utilization of the Luxembourg statutory equalization reserves. 
    
  As permitted by ASC 740, "Income Taxes", the Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits and, therefore, has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits, or any related interest and penalties, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   No   interest or penalties have been recorded by the Company   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
    
  All tax liabilities are payable to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and various state and local taxing agencies. Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the Company s subsidiaries are currently open to audit by the IRS for the years ended December 31, 2012 and thereafter for Federal tax purposes. Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, for state and local tax purposes, the Company is open to audit for tax years ended December 31, 2011 forward, depending on jurisdiction.

The amounts related to this reinsurance treaty are as follows: 

NGHC Quota Share Agreement 
    
  The Company participated in a quota share reinsurance treaty with the related entities listed below whereby it ceded   50%   of the total net earned premiums and net incurred losses and LAE on business with effective dates after March 1, 2010 ( NGHC Quota Share ). 
    
  On August 1, 2013, the Company provided notice to parties of the NGHC Quota Share agreement that it was terminating the agreement. The Company no longer cedes any net earned premiums and net incurred losses and LAE on business with effective dates after July 31, 2013. The termination was on a run-off basis, meaning the Company continued to cede   50%   of the net premiums and the related net losses with respect to policies in force as of July 31, 2013 through the expiration of such policies, the last of which expired on July 31, 2014. 
    
  The NGHC Quota Share provided that the reinsurers pay a provisional ceding commission equal to   32.5%   of ceded earned premium, net of premiums ceded by the Company for inuring reinsurance, subject to adjustment. The ceding commission is subject to adjustment to a maximum of   34.5%   if the loss ratio for the reinsured business is   60.0%   or less and a minimum of   30.5%   if the loss ratio is   64.5%   or greater. Effective October 1, 2012, the parties amended the NGHC Quota Share to decrease the provisional ceding commission from   32.5%   to   32.0%   of ceded earned premium, net of premiums ceded by the Company for inuring reinsurance, subject to adjustment. The ceding commission is subject to adjustment to a minimum of   30.0%   (changed from   30.5%  ), if the loss ratio is   64.5%   or greater. The Company believes that the terms, conditions and pricing of the NGHC Quota Share were determined by arm's length negotiations and reflect market terms and conditions. 
    
  The percentage breakdown by reinsurer of such   50%   is as follows:

  (In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Data) 

Stop-Loss and Retrocession Agreements 
    
  NG Re Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, along with AIIL, an affiliate of the Company, as reinsurers, entered into a   $250,000   Aggregate Stop-Loss Reinsurance Agreement (the "Stop-Loss Agreement") with CP Re. NG Re Ltd. and AIIL also entered into an Aggregate Stop-Loss Retrocession Contract (the "Retrocession Agreement") with ACP Re pursuant to which ACP Re was obligated to reinsure the full amount of any payments that NG Re Ltd. and AIIL were obligated to make to CP Re under the Stop-Loss Agreement. Pursuant to the Stop-Loss Agreement, each of NG Re Ltd. and AIIL provided, severally,   $125,000   of stop loss coverage with respect to the run-off of the Tower business written on or before September 15, 2014. The reinsurers  obligation to indemnify CP Re under the Stop-Loss Agreement was triggered only at such time as CP Re s ultimate paid net loss related to the run-off of the pre-September 15, 2014 Tower business exceeded a retention equal to the Tower Companies  loss and loss adjustment reserves and unearned premium reserves as of September 15, 2014, which, the parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer Agreement have agreed will be established upon reevaluation as of December 31, 2015. CP Re was to pay AIIL and NG Re Ltd. total premium of   $56,000   on the fifth anniversary of the Stop-Loss Agreement. The premium payable by NG Re Ltd. and AIIL to ACP Re pursuant to the Retrocession Agreement was   $56,000   in the aggregate, less a ceding commission of   5.5%   to be retained by NG Re Ltd. and AII. The Company recorded this reinsurance transaction under the deposit method of accounting. On September 20, 2016, the Stop-Loss Agreement and Retrocession Agreement were terminated. 
    
  Credit Agreement 
    
  On September 15, 2014, NG Re Ltd. entered into a credit agreement (the  ACP Re Credit Agreement ) by and among AmTrust, as Administrative Agent, ACP Re and London Acquisition Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACP Re, as the borrowers (collectively, the  Borrowers ), ACP Re Holdings, LLC, as Guarantor, and AIIL and NG Re Ltd., as Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders made a   $250,000   loan (  $125,000   made by each Lender) to the Borrowers on the terms and conditions contained within the ACP Re Credit Agreement. 
    
  On July 28, 2016, the parties entered into a restatement agreement (the  Restatement Agreement ) to the ACP Re Credit Agreement. The parties to the Restatement Agreement agreed to restate the ACP Re Credit Agreement as a result of a   $200,000   contribution (the "Contribution") by the Michael Karfunkel Family 2005 Trust (the  Trust ) and members of the Michael Karfunkel family to CNIC. The Contribution was made in connection with the Conservation Plan developed by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of California for CNIC as successor by merger to the Tower Companies. The restated terms of the ACP Re Credit Agreement became effective on September 20, 2016. 
    
  Under the restated terms, the borrower became ACP Re Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company owned by the Trust. The Trust will cause ACP Re Holdings, LLC to maintain assets having a value greater than   115%   of the value of the then outstanding loan balance, and if there is a shortfall, the Trust will make a contribution to ACP Re Holdings, LLC of assets having a market value of at least the shortfall (the  Maintenance Covenant ). The amounts borrowed are secured by equity interests, cash and cash equivalents, other investments held by ACP Re Holdings, LLC and proceeds of the foregoing in an amount equal to the requirements of the Maintenance Covenant. The maturity date changed from September 15, 2021 to September 20, 2036. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of   $250,000   changed from a fixed annual rate of   7%   to a fixed annual rate of   3.7%  , provided that up to   1.2%   thereof may be paid in kind. Commencing on September 20, 2026, and for each year thereafter,   two percent   of the then outstanding principal balance of the loan (inclusive of any amounts previously paid in kind) is due and payable. A change of control of greater than   50%   and an uncured breach of the Maintenance Covenant are included as events of default. 
    
  The Company recorded interest income of   $2,049   and   $2,115     for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $6,424   and   $6,514     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, under the ACP Re Credit Agreement. 
    
  At   June 30, 2016  , based on the consolidated financial condition of ACP Re and the continued losses from its subsidiaries' legacy Tower book of business, management of the Company identified the loan for impairment evaluation. Management determined that it was probable for the Company to be unable to collect all the contractual principal and interest payments as scheduled in the original ACP Re Credit Agreement, deeming the loan impaired. While the loan was considered impaired at   June 30, 2016  , the Restatement Agreement contains a Maintenance Covenant with a collateral interest which exceeded the   $125,000   outstanding balance. As such, management determined no write down or reserve was needed for the carrying value of the loan at   June 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2016  . Interest income during the period the loan was impaired was   $2,049   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Management evaluates the loan for impairment on a quarterly basis, including the adequacy

of our reserve position based on collateral levels maintained. The Company continues to accrue interest on the loan as all contractually required interest payments have been made in accordance with the terms of the ACP Re Credit Agreement. 
    
  Surplus Notes of the Reciprocal Exchanges 
    
  The Reciprocal Exchanges issued the Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes when they were originally capitalized. The obligation to repay principal and interest on the Reciprocal Exchanges  Surplus Notes is subordinated to the Reciprocal Exchanges  other liabilities. Principal and interest on the Reciprocal Exchanges  Surplus Notes are payable only with regulatory approval. Effective March 31, 2016, the Company purchased the Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes from subsidiaries of ACP Re for an aggregate amount of approximately   $88,900  . The purchase price was based on an independent third party valuation of the fair market value of the surplus notes. At   September 30, 2016  , the surplus notes receivable and the surplus notes payable are eliminated upon consolidation. (See Note 10, "Debt" for additional information). 
    
  AIBD Health Plan 
    
  On September 1, 2012, the Company purchased The Association Benefits Solution companies, a group of companies affiliated with the accident and health insurance industry. As part of the purchase, the Company is now affiliated with AIBD Health Plan which is a welfare benefit plan for several member groups. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a receivable of   $5,425   and   $5,418  , respectively. Also, as part of this plan, the Company utilizes an employer trust to administer additional claims. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a receivable to the employer trust in the amount of   $1,810   and   $2,950  , respectively. 

16. Segment Information 
    
  The Company currently operates   two   business segments, Property and Casualty and Accident and Health. The  Corporate and Other  column represents the activities of the holding company, as well as income from the Company s investment portfolio. The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment profit separately from the results of the Company's investment portfolio. Other operating expenses allocated to the segments are called General and Administrative expenses which are allocated on an actual basis except salaries and benefits where management s judgment is applied. In determining total assets by segment, the Company identifies those assets that are attributable to a particular segment such as deferred acquisition cost, reinsurance recoverable, goodwill, intangible assets and prepaid reinsurance while the remaining assets are allocated to Corporate and Other. 
    
  The Property and Casualty segment, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges and the Management Companies, reports the management fees earned by NGHC from the Reciprocal Exchanges for underwriting, investment management and other services as service and fee income for the Company. The effects of these transactions between NGHC and the Reciprocal Exchanges are eliminated in consolidation to derive consolidated net income.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Note on Forward-Looking Statements

Additional information about these risks and uncertainties, as well as others that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, is contained in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The projections and statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Overview 
    
  We are a specialty personal lines insurance holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we provide a variety of insurance products, including personal and commercial automobile, homeowners and umbrella, supplemental health, lender-placed and other niche insurance products. We sell insurance products with a focus on underwriting profitability through a combination of our customized and predictive analytics and our technology driven low cost infrastructure. 
    
  We manage our business through two segments: Property and Casualty ("P C") and Accident and Health ("A H"). We transact business primarily through our   fifteen   regulated domestic insurance subsidiaries: Integon Casualty Insurance Company, Integon General Insurance Corporation, Integon Indemnity Corporation, Integon National Insurance Company ( Integon National ), Integon Preferred Insurance Company, New South Insurance Company, MIC General Insurance Corporation, National General Insurance Company, National General Assurance Company, National General Insurance Online, Inc., National Health Insurance Company, Personal Express Insurance Company, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Agent Alliance Insurance Company and Century-National Insurance Company ( Century-National ). Our insurance subsidiaries have been assigned an "A-" (Excellent) group rating by A.M. Best. We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda, Luxembourg and Sweden. 
    
  The operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing, the frequency and severity of losses, the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses, general economic conditions, the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates, state regulation of premium rates, changes in fair value of investments, and other factors such as changes in tax laws. The property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity. While these cycles can have a large impact on a company s ability to grow and retain business, we have sought to focus on niche markets and regions where we are able to maintain premium rates at generally consistent levels and maintain underwriting discipline throughout these cycles. We believe that the nature of our P C insurance products, including their relatively low limits, the relatively short duration of time between when claims are reported and when they are settled, and the broad geographic distribution of our customers, have allowed us to grow and retain our business throughout these  

64 

cycles. In addition, we have limited our exposure to catastrophe losses through reinsurance. With regard to seasonality, we tend to experience higher claims and claims expense in our P C segment during periods of severe or inclement weather. 
    
  We evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability, including net loss ratio, net combined ratio (non-GAAP) and operating leverage. We target a net combined ratio (non-GAAP) between 90% and 95% while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our A.M. Best rating objectives. To achieve our targeted net combined ratio (non-GAAP) we continually seek ways to reduce our operating costs and lower our expense ratio. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our annualized operating leverage (the ratio of net earned premium to average total stockholders  equity) was   1.6x  , which was within our planned target operating leverage of between 1.5x and 2.0x. 
    
  Investment income is also an important part of our business. Because we often do not settle claims until several months or longer after we receive the original policy premiums, we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time. We invest our capital and surplus in accordance with state and regulatory guidelines. Our net investment income was   $76.9 million   and   $53.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We held   5.7%   and   9.6%   of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Our most significant balance sheet liability is our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) reserves. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, were   $1,169.2 million   and   $922.4 million  , respectively. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any time based on known facts and circumstances. Our reserves, excluding life reserves, for loss and LAE incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors. Our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. Judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of future claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If we change our estimates, these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made, with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings. 

Principal Revenue and Expense Items 
    
  Gross premium written.   Gross premium written represents premium from each insurance policy that we write, including as a servicing carrier for assigned risk plans, during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy, prior to ceding reinsurance to third parties. 
    
  Net premium written.   Net premium written is gross premium written less that portion of premium that we cede to third-party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. 
    
  Change in unearned premium.   Change in unearned premium is the change in the balance of the portion of premium that we have written but have yet to earn during the relevant period because the policy is unexpired. 
    
  Net earned premium.   Net earned premium is the earned portion of our net premium written. We generally earn insurance premium on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium, which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of six months or one year. For a six-month policy written on January 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premium in the first quarter of 2016 and the other half in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Ceding commission income.   Ceding commission income is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our acquisition, underwriting and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premium ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. The portion of ceding commission income which represents reimbursement of successful acquisition costs related to the underlying policies is recorded as an offset to acquisition and other underwriting expenses. 

65 

Service and fee income.   We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and non-sufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy s term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Non-sufficient fund fees are charged when the customer s payment is returned by the financial institution. 
    
  All fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer s payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer s policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer s policy is reinstated. A non-sufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer s payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked. 
    
  We also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We also collect management fees in connection with our management of the Reciprocal Exchanges. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary. 
    
  Net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and (losses).   We invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets. We report net realized gains and losses on our investments separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when we sell our investment securities for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when we sell our investment securities for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or we write down the investment securities as a result of other-than-temporary impairment loss. We classify our fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale. We report net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available for sale separately in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we have a small portfolio of fixed maturities and equity securities classified as trading. We report realized and unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as trading in earnings. 
    
  Loss and loss adjustment expenses.   Loss and LAE represent our largest expense item and, for any given reporting period, include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations and statistical analyses. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle, and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of claimants and the costs of their medical treatment. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability. 
    
  Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.   Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition and marketing expenses, salaries and benefits expenses. Policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents, wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf and promotional fees directly attributable to our affinity relationships. Acquisition costs also include costs that are related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts including comprehensive loss underwriting exchange reports, motor vehicle reports, credit score checks, and policy issuance costs. 
    
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses is composed of all other operating expenses, including various departmental salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the maintenance of policies, information systems, and accounting for insurance transactions, and other insurance expenses such as federal excise tax, postage, telephones and Internet access charges, as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges. In addition, general and administrative expenses includes those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non-insurance activities in which we engage. 

66 

Interest expense.   Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then-applicable interest rates. 
    
  Income tax expense.   We incur federal, state and local income tax expenses as well as income tax expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. 
    
  Net operating expense.   These expenses consist of the sum of general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses   less   ceding commission income and service and fee income. 
    
  Underwriting income.   Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, interest expense and income taxes. Underwriting income is calculated as net earned premium   plus   ceding commission income and service and fee income   less   loss and LAE, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, and general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated subsidiaries.   This represents primarily our share in earnings or losses of our investment in four companies that own life settlement contracts, which includes the gain realized upon a mortality event and the change in fair value of the investments in life settlements as evaluated at the end of each reporting period. These unconsolidated subsidiaries determine the fair value of life settlement contracts based upon an estimate of the discounted cash flow of the anticipated death benefits incorporating a number of factors, such as current life expectancy assumptions, expected premium payment obligations and increased cost assumptions, credit exposure to the insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the policies. The gain realized upon a mortality event is the difference between the death benefit received and the recorded fair value of that particular policy. 

Insurance Ratios 
    
  Net loss ratio  . The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of loss and LAE incurred to net earned premium. 
    
  Net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP)  . The net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) is one component of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net operating expense to net earned premium. 
    
  Net combined ratio (non-GAAP)  . The net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). If the net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient. 
    
  Net operating expense ratio and net combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, net operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income, and is therefore a non-GAAP measure. Management uses net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and net combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company s management. For a reconciliation showing the total amounts by which acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses were offset by ceding commission income and service and fee income in the calculation of net operating expense, see  Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations   for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (Unaudited)  below.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions could change, which would have an impact on actual results that may differ materially from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions. We have not made any changes in estimates or judgments that have had a significant effect on the reported amounts as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  For more information related to recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , see Note 2, "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

On   June 1, 2016  , we closed the acquisition of Century-National, a California based property and casualty insurance company and Western General, a California corporation. 
    
  On October 1, 2015, we closed on a master transaction agreement with QBE Investments (North America), Inc. ( QBE Parent ) and its subsidiary, QBE Holdings, Inc. (together with QBE Parent,  QBE ), pursuant to which we acquired QBE s lender-placed insurance business ( LPI Business ), including certain of QBE s affiliates engaged in the LPI Business. 
    
  On October 1, 2015, we closed our acquisition of certain business lines and assets from Assurant Health, which is a business segment of Assurant, Inc. As part of the transaction, we acquired the small group self-funded and supplemental product lines, as well as North Star Marketing, a proprietary small group sales channel (the "Assurant Transaction"). 
    
  Since the time of our acquisition of the Attorneys-in-Fact that manage the Reciprocal Exchanges on September 15, 2014, we have been required to consolidate the financial statements of the Reciprocal Exchanges. As noted above in Note 3, "Reciprocal Exchanges" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, due to the adoption of ASU 2015-02 in January 1, 2016, we were not required to consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges as variable interest entities for the first quarter of 2016 (the  Deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ). Accordingly, comparative information regarding revenues, expenses and cash flows will be affected for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as the revenues, expenses and cash flows included the Reciprocal Exchanges in the first quarter of 2015, but such measures exclude the Reciprocal Exchanges for the first quarter of 2016. Effective March 31, 2016, we acquired the surplus notes issued by the Reciprocal Exchanges and in accordance with ASU 2015-02, we consolidated the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  As a result of the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, the Assurant Transaction and the Deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges, comparisons between our 2016 and 2015 results will be less meaningful. 
    
  Consolidated Results of Operations for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   (Unaudited)

The increase by segment was: P C   $206.6 million   and A H   $60.0 million  . The increase in the P C segment was attributable to the acquisitions of Century-National (  $52.0 million  ) and LPI Business (  $103.8 million  ), and organic growth (  $50.9 million  ). The increase in the A H segment was due to premium from the Assurant Transaction (  $46.6 million  ) and organic growth (  $13.4 million  ). 
    
  Ceding commission income.   Ceding commission income   increased   from   $12.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $14.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .

The increase was primarily attributable to our service and fee income related to the A H segment (  $20.5 million  ), resulting primarily from the Assurant Transaction and the increase related to the P C segment (  $14.3 million  ), resulting primarily from Century-National and the LPI Business acquisitions and organic growth. 

71 

The components of service and fee income are as follows: 

Loss and loss adjustment expense; net loss ratio.   Loss and LAE   increased   by   $207.6 million  , or   68.7%  , from   $302.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $509.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, the Assurant Transaction, catastrophe losses related to floods that occurred in Louisiana in August 2016 and loss development related to hail storms that occurred in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas in the first half of 2016, and loss experience in our legacy domestic stop loss programs. The changes by segment were: P C   increased   by   $164.0 million   and A H   increased   by   $43.6 million  . Loss and LAE for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   included   $3.3 million   of unfavorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. The   $3.8 million   of unfavorable development in the P C segment was primarily driven by unfavorable development in private passenger automobile liability of which   $3.1 million   was attributable to the Reciprocal Exchanges, while   $0.5 million   of favorable development in the A H segment was primarily driven by favorable development in our domestic A H businesses. Loss and LAE for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   included   $4.7 million   of favorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves primarily attributable to positive development on claims in the P C segment for private passenger automobile liability. 
    
  Our consolidated net loss ratio   increased   from   60.1%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   66.2%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher P C segment net loss ratio driven by product mix changes, catastrophe losses related to floods that occurred in Louisiana in August 2016 and loss development related to hail storms that occurred in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas in the first half of 2016. 
    
  Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  . Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses   increased   by   $32.0 million  , or   29.4%  , from   $108.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $140.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, the Assurant Transaction and organic growth, partially offset by lower acquisition costs in the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $80.2 million  , or   67.6%  , from   $118.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $198.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, slightly higher expenses in the Reciprocal Exchanges, the Assurant Transaction and organic growth. 
    
  Net operating expense; net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP).   Net operating expense   increased   by   $75.0 million  , or   48.6%  , from   $154.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $229.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The consolidated net operating expense ratio, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges,   decreased   to   29.8%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   30.7%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the net operating expense ratio was   29.0%   and   29.2%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges' net operating expense ratio was   46.0%   and   50.3%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Net investment income.   Net investment income   increased   by   $9.2 million  , or   49.8%   from   $18.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $27.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to interest income from our fixed maturities and increases in our invested assets as a result of our issuances of debt, preferred stock and common stock capital raising activities in 2016 and 2015. 

72 

Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments.   Net realized and unrealized loss on investments increased by   $6.4 million   from   $4.6 million   loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to a   $11.0 million   loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , due to the higher recognition of other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") partially offset by higher net realized and unrealized gains on fixed maturities in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   we reclassified certain available-for-sale securities to trading securities for the purpose of selling them in the near term and benefit from the change in prices. 
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which primarily relates to our 50% interest in life settlement entities,   increased   by   $0.7 million   from   $2.3 million   in earnings for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.0 million   in earnings for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , due to the change in fair market value of the life settlement contracts and income from our real estate investments. 
    
  Interest expense.   Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $10.5 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively.

Income tax expense   increased   by   $0.2 million  , or   2.2%  , from   $8.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , reflecting an effective tax rate of   16.9%  , to   $8.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting an effective tax rate of   23.8%  . Income tax expense included a tax benefit of   $1.6 million   and a tax detriment of   $3.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, attributable to the deferred tax liability associated with the equalization reserves of our Luxembourg reinsurers. The effect of this tax benefit reduced the effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by   4.4%  . The effect of this tax detriment increased the effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   by   7.1%  . 
    
  Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, income tax expense was   $9.1 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, reflecting effective tax rates of   26.5%   and   16.1%  , respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges had pre-tax income of   $2.7 million   and a pre-tax loss of   $2.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. A full valuation allowance was recorded in the Reciprocal Exchanges.

73 

Service and fee income.   Service and fee income   increased   by   $109.3 million  , or   63.1%  , from   $173.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $282.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Loss and LAE for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $8.2 million   of favorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. The   $11.3 million   of favorable development in the P C segment was primarily driven by favorable development in our LPI Business, while   $3.1 million   of unfavorable development in the A H segment was primarily driven by unfavorable development in European A H policies produced by our Euro Accident Health   Care Insurance Aktiebolag ("EHC") business. Loss and LAE for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   included   $2.6 million   of favorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves consisting of   $4.7 million   of positive development on claims in the P C segment for private passenger automobile liability partially offset by   $2.1 million   of loss emergence in the A H segment, of which   $1.4 million   related to domestic medical stop loss programs and   $0.7 million   related to European A H policies. 
    
  Our consolidated net loss ratio   increased   from   61.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   65.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   with a slightly higher P C segment net loss ratio and a higher A H segment net loss ratio primarily driven by greater loss experience in our legacy domestic stop loss programs. 
    
  Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  . Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses   increased   by   $67.4 million  , or   22.8%  , from   $295.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $362.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, the Assurant Transaction, lower acquisition costs in the Reciprocal Exchanges and organic growth, partially offset by the Deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $223.1 million  , or   65.0%  , from   $343.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $566.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the Century-National and LPI Business acquisitions, the Assurant Transaction, slightly higher expenses in the Reciprocal Exchanges, organic growth and the Deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges. 
    
  Net operating expense; net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP).

The net operating expense ratio   decreased   from   23.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   20.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of increased net earned premiums and higher service and fee income partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. 
    
  Underwriting income.   Underwriting income   increased   from   $5.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $14.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of the Assurant Transaction partially offset by underwriting loss in our legacy domestic business. The net combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   slightly   increased   to   95.4%   compared to   94.8%   for the same period in   2015  .

Investment Portfolio 
    
  Our investment strategy emphasizes, first, the preservation of capital and, second, maximization of an appropriate risk-adjusted return. We seek to maximize investment returns using investment guidelines that stress prudent allocation among cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit, commercial paper, pooled short-term money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of 90 days or less. Our fixed maturities include obligations of the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies, obligations of U.S. and Canadian corporations, mortgages guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit entities, and asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage obligations. Our equity securities include common and preferred stock of U.S. and Canadian corporations. From time to time, we also reclassify available-for-sale securities to trading securities for the purpose of buying and selling them in the near term and benefit from the change in market prices or spreads. 
    
  The average yield on our investment portfolio was   3.2%   and   3.3%   and the average duration of the portfolio was   5.58   and   5.00   years for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Available-for-Sale Securities.   The cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value on available-for-sale securities were as follows: 

83 

The   decrease   in gross unrealized losses from   $64.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $11.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   resulted from the recognition of OTTI, fluctuations in market interest rates and performance of our equity securities. 
    
  The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturities and securities pledged, held as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

84 

Gross Unrealized Losses.   The tables below summarize the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale, by the length of time the security had continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

There were   231   and   444   securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that account for the gross unrealized loss, none of which we deemed to be other-than-temporary impairments. At   September 30, 2016  , we have determined  

85 

that the unrealized losses on fixed maturities were primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates since their date of purchase. At   September 30, 2016  , we have determined that the unrealized losses on common stock was primarily due to continued weakness in the equities market. Significant factors influencing our determination that none of these securities were OTTI included the length of time and/or magnitude of unrealized losses in relation to cost, the nature of the investment, the current financial condition of the issuer and its future prospects, the ability to recover to cost in the near term, and management s intent not to sell these securities and it being more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized OTTI of   $22.1 million   and   $22.1 million  , respectively.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized OTTI of   $6.0 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively. OTTI on investments is based on our qualitative and quantitative review. 
    
  Trading Securities.   The cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value on trading securities were as follows: 

Credit Quality of Investments.   The tables below summarize the credit quality of our fixed maturities, securities pledged and preferred securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as rated by Standard   Poor s. 

86 

The tables below summarize the investment quality of our corporate bond holdings and industry concentrations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Restricted Cash and Investments.   In order to conduct business in certain states, we are required to maintain letters of credit or assets on deposit to support state-mandated regulatory requirements and certain third party agreements. We also utilize trust accounts to collateralize business with our reinsurance counterparties. Assets held on deposit or in trust accounts are primarily in the form of cash or certain high-grade securities. The fair values of our restricted assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

87 

The increase in restricted cash and restricted investments from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to our acquisition of Century-National. 
    
  Short-term Investments.   We had short-term investments of   $146,126   and   $3,527  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper issued by large banks and corporations, this commercial paper was rated by Standard   Poor s as A, A+ and A-. The increase from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was a result of our issuance of preferred stock. 
    
  Other Investments.   The table below summarize the composition of our other investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Our other investments consisted primarily of limited partnerships, having investments in residential and commercial real estate, real estate debt funds and preferred securities. We believe our exposure to risk associated with these investments is generally limited to the investment carrying amounts. The increase from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was to diversify our alternative investment portfolio. 
    
  Reverse Repurchase and Repurchase Agreements.   We enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, which are accounted for as either collateralized lending or borrowing transactions and are recorded at contract amounts which approximate fair value. For the collateralized borrowing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements), we receive cash or securities that we invest or hold in short-term or fixed income securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   collateralized lending transaction principal outstanding. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   collateralized borrowings transactions. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had collateralized borrowing transaction principal outstanding of   $52.5 million  , at interest rate of   0.80%  . Interest expense associated with these repurchase borrowing agreements   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, and   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.1 million   interest income and   $0.0 million   interest expense, respectively. We had   $55.4 million   of collateral pledged in support for these agreements as of   December 31, 2015  .

Investment in Entities Holding Life Settlement Contracts 
    
  A life settlement contract is a contract between the owner of a life insurance policy and a third party who obtains the ownership and beneficiary rights of the underlying life insurance policy. During 2010, we formed Tiger Capital LLC ( Tiger ) with a subsidiary of AmTrust for the purpose of acquiring certain life settlement contracts. In 2011, we formed AMT Capital Alpha, LLC ( AMT Alpha ) with a subsidiary of AmTrust for the purpose of acquiring additional life settlement contracts. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired a 50% interest in AMT Capital Holdings, S.A. ( AMTCH ), the other 50% of which is owned by AmTrust. We have a 50% ownership interest in each of Tiger, AMT Alpha and AMTCH (collectively, the  LSC Entities ). The LSC Entities may also acquire premium finance loans made in connection with the borrowers  purchase of life insurance policies that are secured by the policies. The LSC Entities acquire the underlying policies securing the loan through the borrowers  voluntary surrender of the policy in satisfaction of the loan or foreclosure. A third party serves as the administrator for two of the life settlement contract portfolios, for which it receives an administrative fee. The third-party administrator is eligible to receive a percentage of profits after certain time and performance thresholds have been met. 
    
  The LSC Entities account for investments in life settlements in accordance with ASC 325-30, "Investments in Insurance Contracts", which states that an investor shall elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts by using either the investment method or the fair value method. The election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. The LSC Entities have elected to account for these investments using the fair value method. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have a 50% ownership interest in the LSC Entities that hold certain life settlement contracts, and the fair value of these contracts owned by the LSC Entities is   $332.1 million  , with our proportionate interest being   $166.0 million  . Total capital contributions of approximately   $11.0 million   and   $1.1 million   were made to the LSC Entities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for which we contributed approximately   $5.5 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, in those same periods. The LSC Entities used the contributed capital to pay premiums and purchase policies. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the face value amounts of the   256   life insurance policies disclosed in the table below was approximately   $1.6 billion  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the LSC Entities owned no premium finance loans. 
    
  The following table describes details of our investment in LSC Entities as of   September 30, 2016  . This table shows the gross amounts for the portfolio of life insurance policies owned by the LSC Entities, in which we and AmTrust each own a 50% interest. 

(1)   
    The LSC Entities determined the fair value as of   September 30, 2016   based on   224   policies out of   256   policies, as the LSC Entities assigned no value to   32   of the policies as of   September 30, 2016  . The LSC Entities estimated the fair value of a life insurance policy using a cash flow model with an appropriate discount rate. In some cases, the cash flow model calculates the value of an individual policy to be negative, and therefore the fair value of the policy is zero as no liability exists when a negative value is calculated. The LSC Entities are not contractually bound to pay the premium on its life settlement contracts and, therefore, would not pay a willing buyer to assume title of these contracts. Additionally, certain of the LSC Entities' acquired policies were structured to have low premium payments at inception of the policy term, which later escalate greatly towards the tail end of the policy term. At the current time, the LSC Entities expense all premiums paid, even on policies with zero fair value. Once the premium payments escalate, the LSC Entities may allow the policies to lapse. In the event that death benefits are realized in the time frame between initial acquisition and premium escalation, it is a benefit to cash flow of the LSC Entities. 

89 

For the contracts where the LSC Entities determined the fair value to be negative and therefore assigned a fair value of zero, the table below details the amount of premiums paid and the death benefits received during the twelve months preceding   September 30, 2016  :

For additional information about the fair value of the life settlement contracts, see Note 6, "Equity Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information about the risks inherent in determining the fair value of the portfolio of life insurance policies, see Item 1A,    Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business Generally-A portion of our financial assets consists of life settlement contracts that are subject to certain risks    of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We are organized as a holding company with   fifteen   domestic insurance company subsidiaries, various foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, as well as various other non-insurance subsidiaries. Our principal sources of operating funds are premiums, service and fee income, investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. The primary sources of cash for the management companies of the Reciprocal Exchanges are management fees for acting as the attorneys-in-fact for the exchanges. Our primary uses of operating funds include payments of claims and operating expenses. Currently, we pay claims using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash primarily in fixed maturities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Except as set forth below, we expect that projected cash flows from operations, as well as the net proceeds from our debt and equity issuances, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated growth by providing capital to increase the surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as to pay claims and operating expenses, and to pay interest and principal on debt and debt facilities and other holding company expenses for the foreseeable future. However, if our growth attributable to potential acquisitions, internally generated growth, or a combination of these factors, exceeds our expectations, we may have to raise additional capital. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To support our current and future policy writings, we have recently raised substantial capital using a combination of debt and equity, and we may raise additional capital over the next twelve months. 
    
  We may generate liquidity through the issuance of debt or equity securities or financing through borrowings under credit facilities, or a combination thereof. We also have a   $225.0 million   credit agreement, under which there was   $50.0 million   outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The proceeds of borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. See "Revolving Credit Agreements" below. 
    
  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions imposed on insurance companies by their place of domicile which limit the amount of cash dividends or distributions that they may pay to us unless special permission is received from the insurance regulator of the relevant domicile. The aggregate limit imposed by the various domiciliary regulatory authorities of our insurance subsidiaries was approximately   $420.5 million   and   $360.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, taking into account dividends paid in the prior twelve month periods. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   $25.0 million   and   $20.8 million  , respectively, of dividends or return of capital paid by the insurance subsidiaries to National General Management Corp. ("Management Corp.") or the Company. 
    
  We forecast claim payments based on our historical experience. We seek to manage the funding of claim payments by actively managing available cash and forecasting cash flows on both a short-term and long-term basis. Cash payments for claims were   $1,263.6 million   and   $871.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Historically, we have funded claim payments from cash flow from operations (principally premiums), net of amounts ceded to our third party reinsurers. We presently expect to maintain sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated claim obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs. Our cash and cash equivalents and total investments have   increased   from   $2,950.0 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $3,786.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . We do not anticipate selling securities in our investment portfolio to pay claims or to fund operating expenses. Should circumstances arise that would require us to do so, we may incur losses on such sales, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could reduce investment income in future periods. 
    
  Pursuant to a tax allocation agreement by and among us and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, we compute and pay federal income taxes on a consolidated basis. Each subsidiary party to this agreement computes and pays to us its respective share of the federal income tax liability primarily based on separate return calculations. 
    
  The LSC Entities in which we own a 50% interest also purchase life settlement contracts that require the LSC Entities to make premium payments on individual life insurance policies in order to keep the policies in force. We presently expect to maintain sufficient cash flow to make future capital contributions to the LSC Entities to permit them to make future premium payments.

The following table is a summary of our statement of cash flows: 

Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $314.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $211.3 million   net cash   provided by   operating activities for the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash   provided by   operating activities   increased   by   $102.7 million  , primarily from an increase in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and unearned premiums in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 
    
  Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $554.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $514.6 million   net cash   used in   investing activities for the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash   used in   investing activities   increased   by   $39.7 million  , due to an increase of cash used for acquisitions (  $64.6 million  ), an increase of cash used in purchases of investments (  $158.6 million  ), an increase of cash used in purchases of premises and equipment (  $14.8 million  ), offset by a decrease of cash used in investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries (  $56.6 million  ) and a decrease in proceeds received from sale of investments (  $141.7 million  ). 
    
  Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $176.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $450.0 million   net cash   provided by   financing activities for the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash   provided by   financing activities   decreased   by   $273.8 million  , due to a decrease in proceeds received from issuances of common and preferred stock, net of returns of capital (  $176.8 million  ), a decreased in the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, net (  $47.1 million  ), a decrease in proceeds received from borrowings, net of repayments (  $45.9 million  ), increased payments of dividends in 2016 (  $9.5 million  ), partially offset by an increase in cash received for stock options (  $5.6 million  ).

Other Material Changes in Financial Position 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Premiums and other receivables, net   increased   by   $165.1 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the acquisition of Century-National and increased premium volume from our acquired company Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. ("ARS") which is now written on our paper, and additional policies in our A H segment. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves   increased   by   $331.3 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the acquisition of Century-National, increased ARS premium and catastrophe losses within our P C segment, and the increase in incurred but not reported claims in our A H segment. Unearned premiums   increased   by   $276.7 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the acquisition of Century-National and increased ARS premium volume which is now written on our paper. Debt   increased   by   $184.0 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , due to borrowings under our credit facility loan and the Century-National promissory note partially offset by our purchase of the Reciprocal Exchanges' surplus notes. Other liabilities   increased   by   $43.3 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , due to the acquisition of Century-National and an increase in outstanding in process disbursements. 

Reinsurance 
    
  Our insurance subsidiaries utilize reinsurance agreements to transfer portions of the underlying risk of the business we write to various affiliated and third-party reinsurance companies. Reinsurance does not discharge or diminish our obligation to pay claims covered by the insurance policies we issue; however, it does permit us to recover certain incurred losses from our reinsurers and our reinsurance recoveries reduce the maximum loss that we may incur as a result of a covered loss event. We believe it is important to ensure that our reinsurance partners are financially strong and they generally carry at least an A.M. Best rating of   A-   (Excellent) at the time we enter into our reinsurance agreements. We also enter reinsurance relationships with third-party captives formed by agents as a mechanism for sharing risk and profit. The total amount, cost and limits relating to the reinsurance coverage we purchase may vary from year to year based upon a variety of factors, including the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and the level of risk that we choose to retain for our own account. 
    
  As of   July 1, 2016  , a reinsurance property catastrophe excess of loss program went into effect protecting the Reciprocal Exchanges against accumulations of losses resulting from a catastrophic event. The property catastrophe program provides a total of   $355.0 million   in coverage in excess of a   $20.0 million   retention, with one reinstatement. 
    
  As of   May 1, 2016  , our new reinsurance property catastrophe excess of loss program went into effect protecting us against catastrophic events and other large losses. The property catastrophe program provides a total of   $475.0 million   in coverage in excess of a   $50.0 million   retention, with one reinstatement. Included in this coverage is a Florida Hurricane Catastrophic Fund ("FHCF") cover of   $52.2 million   excess of   $16.3 million   with no reinstatement. The casualty program provides   $45.0 million   in coverage in excess of a   $5.0 million   retention. We pay a premium as consideration for ceding the risk. 
    
  For a more detailed description of our reinsurance arrangements, see   Reinsurance   in   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

7.625% Subordinated Notes due 2055 
    
  On August 18, 2015, we sold   $100.0 million   aggregate principal amount of our   7.625%   subordinated notes due 2055 (the    7.625%   Notes ) in a public offering. The net proceeds we received from the issuance was approximately   $96.6 million  , after deducting the underwriting discount, commissions and expenses. 
    
  The   7.625%   Notes bear interest at a rate equal to   7.625%   per year, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015. The   7.625%   Notes are our subordinated unsecured obligations and rank (i) senior in right of payment to any future junior subordinated debt, (ii) equal in right of payment with any unsecured, subordinated debt that we incur in the future that ranks equally with the   7.625%   Notes, and (iii) subordinate in right of payment to any of our existing and future senior debt, including amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, our   6.75%   Notes and certain of our other obligations. In addition, the   7.625%   Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The   7.625%   Notes mature on September 15, 2055, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us. 
    
  Interest expense on the   7.625%   Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.9 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively. Interest expense on the   7.625%   Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $1.1 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  The indenture contains customary covenants, such as reporting of annual and quarterly financial results, and restrictions on certain mergers and consolidations. The indenture also includes covenants relating to the incurrence of debt if our consolidated leverage ratio would exceed   0.35   to   1.00  , a limitation on liens, a limitation on the disposition of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and a limitation on transactions with certain of our affiliates. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture as of   September 30, 2016  . 

6.75% Notes due 2024 
    
  On May 23, 2014, we sold   $250.0 million   aggregate principal amount of our   6.75%   Notes due 2024 (the "  6.75%   Notes") to certain purchasers in a private placement. The net proceeds we received from the issuance was approximately   $245.0 million  , after deducting the issuance expenses. 
    
  The   6.75%   Notes bear interest at a rate equal to   6.75%   per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2014. The   6.75%   Notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the   6.75%   Notes. The   6.75%   Notes are also effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries (including trade payables). The   6.75%   Notes mature on May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us. 
    
  On   October 8, 2015  , we sold an additional   $100.0 million   aggregate principal amount of our   6.75%   Notes to certain purchasers in a private placement. The additional   6.75%   Notes bear interest at a rate equal to   6.75%   per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on   November 15, 2015  . The additional   6.75%   Notes mature on   May 15, 2024  , unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us. The net proceeds we received from the issuance was approximately   $98.9 million  , after deducting the estimated issuance expenses payable us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes, including strategic acquisitions and to support its current and future policy writings. The additional   6.75%   Notes were issued under the same indenture as the original   6.75%   Notes. 
    
  Interest expense on the   6.75%   Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $6.0 million   and   $17.7 million  , respectively. Interest expense on the   6.75%   Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $4.3 million   and   $12.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  The indenture contains customary covenants, such as reporting of annual and quarterly financial results, and restrictions on certain mergers and consolidations. The indenture also includes covenants relating to the incurrence of debt if our consolidated leverage ratio would exceed   0.35   to   1.00  , a limitation on liens, a limitation on the disposition of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and a limitation on transactions with certain of our affiliates. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture as of   September 30, 2016  .

Revolving Credit Agreement 
    
  On   January 25, 2016  , we entered into a   $225.0 million   credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, KeyBank National Association as Syndication Agent, and Associated Bank, National Association and First Niagara Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, and the various lending institutions party thereto. The credit facility is a revolving credit facility with a letter of credit sublimit of   $112.5 million   and an expansion feature not to exceed   $50.0 million  . Proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of   January 25, 2020  . 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants customary for facilities of this type (subject to negotiated exceptions and baskets), including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and investments, restricted payments and dispositions. There are also financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum risk-based capital and a minimum statutory surplus. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, with grace periods where customary, including failure to pay principal when due, failure to pay interest or fees within   three   business days after becoming due, failure to comply with covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, the occurrence of certain material judgments, or a change in control of the Company. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the administrative agent, upon the request of the requisite percentage of the lenders, may terminate the obligations of the lenders to make loans and to issue letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, declare the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Alternate Base Rate ("ABR") or LIBOR. ABR borrowings (which are borrowings bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the ABR) under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (x) the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the   federal funds   effective rate on such day plus   0.5 percent   or (c) the adjusted   LIBOR   for a one-month interest period on such day plus   1 percent  . Eurodollar borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect. Fees payable by us under the Credit Agreement include a letter of credit participation fee (the margin applicable to Eurodollar borrowings), a letter of credit fronting fee with respect to each letter of credit (  0.125%  ) and a commitment fee on the available commitments of the lenders (a range of   0.20%   to   0.30%   based on our consolidated leverage ratio, and which rate was   0.30%   as of   September 30, 2016  ). 
    
  On May 31, 2016, we borrowed   $50,000   under the Credit Agreement, Eurodollar borrowings was elected for interest rate. Interest payments are due the last day of the interest period in intervals of three months duration, commencing on the date of such borrowing. The borrowing bears interest at the adjusted   LIBOR   rate which was   3.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest expense on the Credit Agreement   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. We were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Imperial-related Debt 
    
  Our subsidiary, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, is the issuer of   $5.0 million   principal amount of Surplus Notes due 2034 ("Imperial Surplus Notes"). The notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to   LIBOR   plus   4.05%  , payable quarterly. The notes are redeemable by us at a redemption price equal to   100%   of their principal amount. Interest expense on the Imperial Surplus Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. Interest expense on the Imperial Surplus Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively.

Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes 
    
  The Reciprocal Exchanges issued surplus notes ("Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes") when they were originally capitalized. The obligation to repay principal and interest on these surplus notes is subordinated to the Reciprocal Exchanges  other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders and claimants for benefits under insurance policies. Principal and interest on these surplus notes are payable only with regulatory approval. Interest expense on the Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $3.6 million   and   $11.1 million  , respectively, which includes amortization of   $1.9 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively. Effective March 31, 2016, we purchased the Reciprocal Exchanges' Surplus Notes from subsidiaries of ACP Re for an aggregate amount of approximately   $88.9 million  . The purchase price was based on an independent third party valuation of the fair market value of the surplus notes. At   September 30, 2016  , the surplus notes receivable and surplus notes payable are eliminated upon consolidation. Interest income and interest expense from the purchased date were also eliminated upon consolidation. (See Note 3, "Reciprocal Exchanges" and Note 15, "Related Party Transactions" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 

Century-National Promissory Note 
    
  On   June 1, 2016  , in connection with the closing of our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Century-National and Western General, we issued a promissory note ("Century-National Promissory Note")     in the approximate amount of   $178.9 million   to the seller to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition. The Century-National Promissory Note is unsecured and has a two-year term. Principal on the Century-National Promissory Note is payable in   two   equal installments of approximately   $89.4 million   on June 1, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Century-National Promissory Note accrues at an annual rate of   4.4%   and is payable in arrears on each of the two payment dates. The Century-National Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time, without penalty. The Century-National Promissory Note contains a cross-acceleration provision that is triggered in the event that payment under our   $225.0 million   Credit Agreement is accelerated and such acceleration is not revoked, rescinded or withdrawn within 30 days of such acceleration. The Century-National Promissory Note also contains customary events of default. Interest expense on the Century-National Promissory Note   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $2.0 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively. 

Securities Sold (Purchased) Under Agreements to Repurchase (Sell), at Contract Value 
    
  We enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, which are accounted for as either collateralized lending or borrowing transactions and are recorded at contract amounts which approximate fair value. For the collateralized borrowing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements), we receive cash or securities that we invest or hold in short-term or fixed income securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   collateralized lending transaction principal outstanding. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   collateralized borrowings transactions. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had collateralized borrowing transaction principal outstanding of   $52.5 million  , at interest rate of   0.80%  . Interest expense associated with these repurchase borrowing agreements   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, and   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.1 million   interest income and   $0.0 million   interest expense, respectively. We had   $55.4 million   of collateral pledged in support for these agreements as of   December 31, 2015  .

Preferred Stock 
    
  Series C Preferred Stock 
    
  On   July 7, 2016  , we completed a public offering of   8,000,000   of our depositary shares, each representing a1/40th interest in a share of our   7.50%   Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C,   $0.01   par value per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), with a liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share (equivalent to   $25   per depositary share). Each depositary share entitles the holder to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock represented thereby (including any dividend, liquidation, redemption and voting rights). Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares will be payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a non-cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, at a rate of   7.50%   per annum, quarterly in arrears, on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2016, from and including the date of original issuance. The Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares is not redeemable prior to   July 15, 2021  . After that date, we may redeem at our option, in whole or in part, the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares at a redemption price of   $1,000   per share (equivalent to   $25   per depositary share) plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then current dividend period. A total of   8,000,000   depositary shares (equivalent to   200,000   shares of Series C Preferred Stock) were issued, including the underwriters' over-allotment option. Net proceeds from this offering were   $193.5 million  . We incurred approximately   $6.5 million   in underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, which were recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. 

ACP Re Credit Agreement 
    
  On July 28, 2016, NG Re Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, AmTrust and its wholly-owned subsidiary AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AIIL"), entered into a restatement agreement (the "Restatement Agreement") to the ACP Re Credit Agreement, dated September 15, 2014, among AmTrust, as Administrative Agent, ACP Re, ACP Re Holdings, LLC, as Guarantor, and AIIL and NG Re Ltd., as Lenders.  
    
  On September 20, 2016, the terms of the Restatement Agreement became effective altering the original terms of the ACP Re Credit Agreement principally by lengthening the maturity date, reducing the interest rate and improving the credit profile. Such modification of terms were deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring under GAAP. Based on the maintenance covenant within the Restatement Agreement, we possess a collateral interest of at least   115%   of the   $125.0 million   outstanding balance. At   September 30, 2016  , management determined no write down or reserve in the carrying value of the loan was required as a result of the new terms of the Restatement Agreement. We evaluate the loan for impairment on a quarterly basis, including the adequacy of our reserve position based on collateral levels maintained. (See Note 15, "Related Party Transactions" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Liquidity Risk.   Liquidity risk represents our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they become due. We maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations. We purchase reinsurance coverage to mitigate the risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. 
    
  Credit Risk.   Credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed-maturity securities and the financial condition of our third party reinsurers. Additionally, we have counterparty credit risk with our repurchase agreement counterparties. 
    
  We address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed-maturity securities by investing primarily in fixed-maturity securities that are rated  BBB-  or higher by Standard   Poor s. We also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed-maturity securities. To limit our risk exposure, we employ diversification policies that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector. 
    
  We are subject to credit risk with respect to our third party reinsurers. Although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them, we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded. As a result, reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers. We address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers that have an A.M. Best rating of  A-  (Excellent) or better at the time we enter into the agreement and by performing, along with our reinsurance broker, periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers. If one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade, we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment, including commutation, novation and letters of credit. See Item 2, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Reinsurance.  
    
  Counterparty credit risk with our repurchase agreement counterparties is mitigated by obtaining collateral. We obtain collateral in the amount of 105-110% of the value of the securities we have sold with agreement to repurchase. Additionally, repurchase agreements are only transacted with pre-approved counterparties. 
    
  Market Risk.   Market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The major components of market risk affecting us are interest rate risk and equity price risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk.   We had fixed maturities, securities pledged and preferred stock with a fair value of   $3,022.4 million   and a cost or amortized cost of   $2,897.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   that are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed-maturity securities. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability matching and capital management process. In the management of this risk, the characteristics of duration, credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements. These risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position. 
    
  The table below summarizes the interest rate risk by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed-maturity securities as of   September 30, 2016   to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, and the associated impact on our stockholders  equity. We anticipate that we will continue to meet our obligations out of income. We classify our fixed-maturity and equity securities as available-for-sale. Temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our stockholders  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. 
    
  The selected scenarios with our fixed maturities (including our securities pledged) and excluding   $15.8 million   of preferred stock, in the table below are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturities and on our stockholders  equity, each as of   September 30, 2016  . 

100 

Changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of our fixed-rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on our earnings or cash flow. We currently have   $683.9 million   principal amount of debt instruments of which   $628.9 million   are fixed-rate debt instruments. A fluctuation of 100 basis points in interest on our variable-rate debt instruments, which are tied to LIBOR, would affect our earnings and cash flows by   $0.6 million   before income tax, on an annual basis, but would not affect the fair market value of the variable-rate debt. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Risk.   As of   September 30, 2016   we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

101 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

102 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are routinely involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, in particular in connection with claims adjudication with respect to our policies. We believe we have recorded adequate reserves for these liabilities and that there is no individual case pending that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   as filed with the SEC.

CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, Barry Karfunkel, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of National General Holdings Corp.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a)

  I, Michael Weiner, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of National General Holdings Corp.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of the annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
