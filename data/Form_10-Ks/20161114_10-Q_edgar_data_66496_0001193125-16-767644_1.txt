  MILLS MUSIC TRUST  
 NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF CASH RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS  
 THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  
  (UNAUDITED)     NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Organization and Background   
 Mills Music Trust (the   Trust  ) was created by a Declaration of Trust, dated December 3, 1964 (the   Declaration of
Trust  ), for the purpose of acquiring from Mills Music, Inc. (  Old Mills  ), the right to receive payment of a deferred contingent purchase price obligation (the   Contingent Portion  ) payable to Old Mills.
The obligation to pay the Contingent Portion arose as the result of the sale by Old Mills of its music and lyric copyright catalogue (the   Catalogue  ) to a newly formed company pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated
December 5, 1964 (the   Asset Purchase Agreement  ). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, payment of the Contingent Portion to the Trust continues until the end of the year in which the last copyright in the Catalogue
expires and cannot be renewed.    The Contingent Portion amounts are currently payable by EMI Mills Music Inc. (  EMI  ), the owner of the
copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. The Trust has been advised that Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is the administrator and manager of EMI and the Catalogue.  
 HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. is the Corporate Trustee of the Trust (the   Corporate Trustee  ), and Lee Eastman and Michael E. Reiss are the
Individual Trustees of the Trust (the   Individual Trustees   and together with the Corporate Trustee, the   Trustees  ).  
  Proceeds from Contingent Portion Payments     The Trust
receives quarterly payments of the Contingent Portion from EMI and distributes the amounts it receives to the registered owners of Trust certificates (the   Unit Holders  ) representing interests in the Trust (the   Trust
Units  ), after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust provides that these are the Trust s sole responsibilities and that the Trust is prohibited from engaging in
any business activities.    Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are based on royalty income which the Catalogue generates. The Trust does not
own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset
Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust as its Contingent Portion payment obligation, in accordance with
the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.    The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement. For information regarding the calculation of the Contingent Portion and a related dispute between EMI and the Trust see  Contingent Portion Payments  under Part I   Item 2,  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .     Cash Distributions to Unit Holders   
 The Declaration of Trust provides for the distribution to the Unit Holders of all funds the Trust receives after payment of, or withholdings in connection
with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. For information regarding disbursements made to Unit Holders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 see the table headed  Statement of Cash Receipts
and Disbursements  under Part I   Item 1,  Financial Statements .

Table of Contents  

   The Copyright Catalogue   
 The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 25,000 music titles (the   Copyrighted Songs  ), of which approximately 1,600 produced royalty
income in recent years. EMI has provided the Trust with a listing of the top 50 earning songs in the Catalogue during the 2015 calendar year (the   Top 50 Songs  ), together with certain copyright information with respect to each of
the Top 50 Songs (the   2015 Listing  ). A copy of the 2015 Listing, as provided to the Trust, is included in the Trust s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The 2015 Listing does not
include any information regarding Copyrighted Songs for the 2016 calendar year.     Accounting Policies   
 Payments to the Trust of the Contingent Portion are typically made in March, June, September and December for the prior calendar quarter. The payments received
are accounted for on a cash basis, as are expenses of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust provides for the distribution of the amounts it receives in Contingent Portion payments to the Unit Holders after payment of, or withholdings in connection
with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust.    The Trust s financial statements reflect only cash transactions and do not include transactions that
would be recorded in financial statements presented on the accrual basis of accounting, as contemplated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Trust does not prepare a balance sheet or a statement of cash flows.  
 NOTE 2. INCOME TAXES    No provision for income taxes has been
made since the liability is that of the Unit Holders and not the Trust.    NOTE 3. GOVERNANCE OF THE TRUST  
 The Trust does not have, nor does the Declaration of Trust provide for, officers or a board of directors. HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. is the Corporate Trustee of the
Trust, and Lee Eastman and Michael E. Reiss are the Individual Trustees of the Trust. Pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, the Trustees of the Trust serve until their removal, resignation, incapacity, or in the case of Individual Trustees, their
death.    On December 23, 2014, the Trust adopted a code of ethics (as defined in Item 406 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of
1933) applicable to the Individual Trustees and the trust officers of the Corporate Trustee. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided to any person without charge upon written request to the Trust at its administrative office, c/o HSBC BANK
USA, N.A., Corporate Trust, Issuer Services, 452 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. In addition, the Trust relies on the Corporate Trustee to abide by HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. s Statement of Business Principles and Code of Ethics, which is available on
the Corporate Trustee s website at http://www.us.hsbc.com.    The Trust is not a corporate entity and thus does not have an Audit Committee. The Trust
has established a policy with regard to audit, audit-related and certain non-audit engagements of its independent auditors. Under this policy, the Trust annually approves certain limited, specified recurring services which may be provided by the
Trust s accountant or independent auditors. All other engagements for services to be performed by the Trust s independent auditors must be separately preapproved by the Trust. Joel Faden of Schulman Lobel et al. LLP (formerly of Joel
Faden, CPA, P.C.) acts as Chief Financial Individual providing accounting services for the Trust.    NOTE 4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
 The Trustees are paid in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, which provides that each Trustee shall receive annual compensation of $2,500, provided that
such aggregate compensation to the Trustees as a group may not exceed 3% of the Contingent Portion amounts received by the Trust in any year. The Declaration of Trust also provides for the reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in the
performance of a Trustee s duties to the Trust, including clerical and administrative services. Accordingly, the Trustees are entitled to receive annual compensation and reimbursement for services performed for the Trust, including the
Corporate Trustee s services as the Registrar and Transfer Agent of the certificates representing the Trust Units. The Declaration of Trust also provides that if a Trustee performs unusual or extraordinary services, reasonable compensation for
such services shall be paid, subject to the terms and conditions of the Declaration of Trust.  
      3

  Pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, disbursements were made as follows to the Trustees for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:      

(1) 
 These services are performed by the Corporate Trustee.      The administrative office of the Trust is located at
the offices of the Corporate Trustee, HSBC Bank, USA, N.A., Corporate Trust Issuer Services, 452 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10018. Except for fees paid to the Corporate Trustee in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, no expense is being
charged or paid by the Trust for the office space and office equipment of the Corporate Trustee that is being utilized for the Trust.     
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     The Copyright Catalogue   
 The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 25,000 music titles, of which approximately 1,600 produced royalty income in recent years. Based on the 2015
Listing, the Trust s receipts are derived principally from copyrights established prior to 1958 in the Unites States. The receipts fluctuate based on consumer interest in the nostalgia appeal of older songs and the overall popularity of the
songs contained in the Catalogue. The Catalogue also generates royalty income in Canada and other foreign countries in which copyright is claimed.    A
number of factors create uncertainties with respect to the Catalogue s ability to continue to generate royalty income on a continuing, long-term basis for the Trust. These factors include: (i) the effect that foreign and domestic copyright
laws and any changes thereto have or will have on renewal rights (e.g., vesting of renewal term rights), (ii) the length of the term of copyright protection under foreign and domestic copyright laws, (iii) reversionary rights that may
effect whether EMI is able to retain its rights to the Copyrighted Songs during certain renewal terms (e.g., statutory termination of transfers or  copyright recapture ) and (iv) ongoing disputes regarding the payment and calculation
of the Contingent Portion.    The Trust does not own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for
collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection
with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust in accordance with its Contingent Portion payment obligation.    The
Trust s income is dependent, in part, on EMI s ability to maintain its rights in the Copyrighted Songs through copyright protection. As the copyrights for the Copyrighted Songs expire, less royalty income will be generated and the size of
each payment of the Contingent Portion will be reduced accordingly.    Based on the 2015 Listing, the Top 50 Songs obtained copyright registration under the
United States Copyright Act of 1909 (the   1909 Act  ) between 1922 and 1958. For copyrighted works subject to the 1909 Act, copyright law generally provides for a possible 95 years of copyright protection, subject to certain factors,
including the initial registration date of each copyright and compliance with certain statutory provisions including notice and renewal. The Copyright expiration dates for the Top 50 Songs range between 1997 and 2076, as set forth in the 2015
Listing.    The Copyrighted Songs are subject to statutory rights of termination of transfers, which may impact whether EMI is able to retain its ownership
of the Copyrighted Songs during their respective terms of copyright protection. For copyrights governed by the 1909 Act, this termination right vests at the end of two different renewal terms, which  

      4  

Table of Contents  

vary for each Copyrighted Song. As the owner of the Catalogue, EMI (and not the Trust) is responsible for administrating the Catalogue and seeking renewals of the Copyrighted Songs. The Asset
Purchase Agreement provides that EMI is obligated to use its best efforts to secure renewals.     Contingent Portion Payments   
 Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are ordinarily made on a quarterly basis, approximately two to three months after a quarter ends. The Trust
distributes the amounts it receives in Contingent Portion payments to the Unit Holders after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust.  
 The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Prior to the first quarter of 2010, the
Contingent Portion was calculated as an amount ranging from 65% to 75% of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty expenses. In addition, the Contingent Portion was guaranteed to be at least
a minimum of $167,500 per quarter (the   Minimum Payment Obligation  ).    Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Asset Purchase
Agreement provides for certain changes with respect to the calculation of the Contingent Portion. One such change is that the Minimum Payment Obligation is no longer in effect. The Trust is also of the view that the Contingent Portion payable to the
Trust changed to a fixed 75% of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty related expenses (the   New Calculation Method  ). However, EMI has disputed that the New Calculation
Method is the correct interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result of the New Calculation Method not being applied, EMI s payments of the Contingent Portion have been deficient, in the Trust s view, by the following amounts
(the   Underpayments  ):      
   As of the date hereof, the Trust has not received the Underpayments. The Trust can offer no assurance that it will be able to
recover any of the Underpayments or that it will resolve the dispute relating to the New Calculation Method with respect to future payments of the Contingent Portion.  
 The Trust also asserted that even under EMI s own interpretation of the formula set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement governing calculation of the
Contingent Portion payment to be made to the Trust in each quarterly period, EMI had over-deducted gross royalty income for the quarterly periods beginning with the third quarter of 2012 through the second quarter of 2014 and for the fourth quarter
of 2014. In a letter dated July 15, 2015, EMI agreed with the Trust s assessment, and on July 17, 2015 the Corporate Trustee confirmed receipt of an EMI payment to the Trust in the aggregate amount of $203,706, reflecting the
cumulative over-deductions of gross royalty income during the quarters ending with the fourth quarter of 2014.    The Trust has engaged Prager Metis CPAs,
LLC to conduct a special audit of the books and records of EMI administered by Sony/ATV to resolve the ongoing dispute and also determine whether there have been any other material royalty omissions or expense over-deductions for the periods ending
September 30, 2015.     Recent Contingent Portion Payment   
 On September 1, 2016 the Trust received a Contingent Portion payment of $204,729 (or $$0.7372 per Trust Unit) from EMI, which was attributable to
royalties from the second quarter of 2016.  
      5

   Recent Distributions to Unit Holders   
 On September 23, 2016, the Trust made a distribution of $171,676 (or $0.6182 per Trust Unit) to the Trust s Unit Holders of record at the close of
business on September 16, 2016. For computation details regarding the distribution please refer to the quarterly distribution report, dated September 23, 2016, attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on  Form 8-K,  filed by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 17, 2016.     Cash and
Administrative Expenses     As of November 3, 2016, the Trust was holding $64 in cash and had received invoices for an aggregate of $29,203 in unpaid
administrative expenses for services rendered to the Trust.     Inflation   
 The Trust does not believe that inflation has materially affected its activities.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Declaration of Trust
provides for the distribution to the Unit Holders of all funds the Trust receives after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust.  
 See the table headed  Statement of Cash Receipts and Disbursements  under Part 1   Item 1,  Financial Statements  for
information regarding cash disbursements made to Unit Holders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     There are no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Trust s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations or liquidity that is material to investors.
     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
 Not applicable      ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES    (a) Controls and Procedures  
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Trust carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Trust s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) under the supervision and with the participation of the Trust s management, including the Chief Financial
Individual providing accounting services and the trust officer of the Corporate Trustee. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Financial Individual providing accounting services and the trust officer of the Corporate Trustee concluded that the
Trust s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.    Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Trust s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Trust s reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Trust s management, including the Chief Financial Individual providing accounting services and the trust officer of the Corporate Trustee, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
