NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Nature
of Business   

On
August 9, 2010 the Company was incorporated as Nepia Inc. in the State of Nevada. From August 9, 2010 to July 18, 2013, the Company
was in the business of developing, manufacturing, and selling small boilers aimed at farmers primarily in Southeast Asia. Beginning
on July 19, 2013, the Company acquired bio-pharmaceutical intellectual property for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and is entering into phase II human studies. The goal is to perfect this indication for marketing purposes for distribution
world-wide. On August 26, 2013, as a consequence of our new business direction, the Company changed its name to Rich Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. ( Rich  or  the Company ).  

On
July 18, 2013, the Company designated, from our 10,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001, 6,000,000 shares
of Series  A  Preferred Stock. Our Series  A  Preferred Stock has voting rights of 100 votes per share
and votes with common shares as a single class.  

On
July 18, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) with Imagic, LLC
and its principals to acquire certain assets including a US Patent entitled  Phorbol esters as anti-neoplastic and white
blood cell elevating agents  and all related intellectual property associated with the patent. In consideration for the
intellectual property the Company issued 827,670 common shares, and 6,000,000 Series  A  Preferred shares. The common
and preferred shares were valued at $123,973. The Company further agreed to use its best efforts to complete a financing resulting
in proceeds of at least $2,000,000. If the Company was unable to raise $400,000 according to the terms of the Assignment Agreement,
the patent reverts back to Imagic, LLC and its principals. On January 17, 2014, the right of reversion was terminated in exchange
for a payment of $20,000.  

On
July 19, 2013, the Company entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations
(the  Sale Agreement ) with our prior officers and directors. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Company transferred
all assets and business operations associated with our boiler business in exchange for assumption of all obligations associated
with that business and cancellation of loans amounting to $28,818. The cancellation of debt was recorded as additional paid-in
capital. In consequence to the Sale Agreement two former officers sold 5,312,925 common shares held by them to our new officer/director.
In turn, our new officer/director agreed to cancel 5,002,554 of those shares he received and returned them to treasury for retirement.
Certain other shareholders also agreed to cancel 2,625,210 common shares.  

On
September 5, 2013, the Company increased the authorized common shares, par value $0.0010, from 900,000 shares to 375,030,000 shares.
Correspondingly, the Company affirmed a forward split of 4.167 for 1 in which each shareholder was issued 4.167 common shares
for each share held. All share and per share date included in these financial statements has been retrospectively adjusted to
account for the stock split.  

Effective
February 11, 2016, the Company approved a reverse stock split of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share at a ratio of 1
for 100 of each share issued and outstanding on the effective date. These financial statements retroactively reflect the reverse
stock split for all periods.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

  The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30,
2016 and March 31, 2016 the Company had $- and $-, respectively, of unrestricted cash.

NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Basis
of Presentation   

  The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in U.S. dollars. The Company has adopted a March 31 fiscal
year end.  

Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with
a reading of the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Property
and Equipment   

  Property
and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. The useful lives of the assets are as follows: Computer equipment, 3 years.  

Long-Lived
and Intangible Assets   

  The
Company accounts for long-lived and intangible assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05,  Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate.
The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result
from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an
impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair value or disposable value.
As of March 31, 2014, the Company fully impaired their intangible assets to $0. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company
acquired another intangible asset from a related party and valued it at the cost of the intangible to the related party totaling
$82,120. As of March 31, 2015, the Company fully impaired their intangible assets to $0.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
amounts due to related parties, stock deposits, and a convertible note payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments
approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise
disclosed in these financial statements.  

Fair
value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs
used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring
that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing
the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs
are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or
liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

NOTE

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments (continued)   

  Level
1   Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

  Level
2   Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly;  

  Level
3   Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.  

The
Company did not have any level 1 or level 3 financial instruments at September 30, 2016 or March 31, 2016. As of September 30,
2016, the derivative liabilities were considered a level 2 item; see Note 8.  

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Income
Taxes   

  Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

Revenue
Recognition   

  The
Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.  

Research
and Development   

  The
Company will charge research and development costs to expense when incurred. The research and development costs include payments
made to unrelated third party vendors for their work on enhancements to existing technology, or research into new potentially
patentable products or processes.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

  Stock-based
compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. On September 6, 2013, the Company approved the adoption
of Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2013 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the  2013 Plan ). The 2013 Plan is intended to
aid in recruiting and retaining key employees, directors or consultants and to motivate them by providing incentives through the
granting of awards of stock options or other stock based awards. The 2013 Plan is administered by the board of directors. Directors,
officers, employees and consultants and our affiliates are eligible to participate under the 2013 Plan. A total of 3,900,048 common
shares have been reserved for awards under the 2013 Plan. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company granted 197,500 stock
options to officers, directors, employees and consultants. During the period ended March 31, 2016, the Company granted 3,900,003
stock options to officers, directors, employees and consultants. The Company made the following modifications to the exercise
prices of its options: January 12, 2015, the Company modified the exercise price on all outstanding stock options to $0.17; April
6, 2015, the Company modified the exercise price on all outstanding stock options to $0.08 per share; August 4, 2015, the Company
modified the exercise price on all outstanding stock options to $0.01 per share.

Basic
Loss Per Share   

  The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the
Company s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as
of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

  The
Company does not expect the adoption of any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the
Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.  

NOTE
2   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

Property
and equipment, recorded at cost, consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016:

expense was $863 and $799 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. 

NOTE
3   INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

On
July 18, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) with Imagic, LLC
and its principals to acquire certain assets including a US Patent entitled  Phorbol esters as anti-neoplastic and white
blood cell elevating agents  and all related intellectual property associated with the patent. In consideration for the
intellectual property the Company issued 827,670 common shares and 6,000,000 Series  A  Preferred Stock. These shares
were valued at a total of $123,973. The Company has also paid additional funds to third parties to further the development of
this asset and terminate the right of reversion totaling $45,000. The Company analyzed the assets at March 31, 2014 and determined
that the value could not be supported and impaired the assets to $0.  

On
October 6, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) with Imagic,
LLC and its principals to acquire certain assets including a US Patent entitled  Compositions and methods of use of Phorbol
Esters for the treatment of Hodgkin s Lymphoma , and all related intellectual property, inventions and trade secrets,
data and clinical study results. In consideration for the intellectual property the Company issued 2,207,920 common shares. These
shares were valued at a total of $7,904,355; however, since the asset was acquired from a related party the Company valued the
asset at the cost of the asset to the related party, $82,120, and treated the excess value as a deemed dividend reducing additional
paid in capital. The Company analyzed the assets at March 31, 2015 and determined that the value could not be supported and impaired

NOTE
8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)   

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative liability upon the initial conversion date and at
each reporting period.  Included in the model to value the derivative liabilities of the above loans are the following
assumptions: stock price at valuation date of $0.0002, exercise price of $0.0001 - $0.000116, dividend yield of zero, years to
maturity of 0.060270   .728770, a risk free rate of 0.29% - 0.59%, and annualized volatility of 284% - 379%. The above loans
were all discounted in full with the exception of the March 2, 2015 loan which had a debt discount of $46,370, the May 5, 2015
loan which had an initial debt discount of $41,222, and the May 27, 2015 loan which had an initial debt discount of $15,000. Based
on the valuations on the initial valuation dates for the period ending September 30, 2016, the Company recognized debt discounts
related to the conversion features totaling $- and a derivative expense of $- related to the excess value of the derivative liabilities.
Once the loans are fully converted, the remaining derivative liability is reclassified to equity as additional paid-in capital.
As of September 30, 2016, unamortized debt discount, including original issue discounts totaled $16,005. The derivative liabilities
totaled $270,531 as of September 30, 2016, of which $- related to long-term debt.

NOTE
11   LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has a working capital deficit, has not yet received revenues from sales of products or services, and has incurred losses
since inception. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common
stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management s plans include selling its
equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations; however, there can be no
assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview   

   Results
of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016   

  We
generated no revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016. We do not anticipate earnings revenues until we are
able to sell or license our products.  

  Our
operating expenses and net loss during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 were $182,795 and $398,272 respectively,
as compared with $234,528 and $560,442 for the same period ended 2015. The operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 consisted mainly of professional fees ($34,158), wages and taxes ($96,001), and office expense ($35,472). The operating
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 consisted mainly of professional fees ($88,401), wages and taxes ($191,956),
and office expense ($70,046).  

The operating expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 consisted mainly of professional fees ($26,338), wages and taxes ($91,071), office expense
($25,140) and stock based compensation ($62,301). The operating expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2015 consisted
mainly of professional fees ($92,285), wages and taxes ($182,793), office expense ($45,894) and stock based compensation of ($192,392). 

  We
anticipate our operating expenses will continue to increase with our plan of operations.  

   Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

  As
of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $0; we had total current liabilities of $2,761,048; and we had a stockholders 
deficit of $2,758,179. Operating activities used $190,438 in cash for the six months ended September 30, 2016.  

  Our
net loss of $444,883 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 primarily accounted for our negative operating cash flow. Financing
activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016 generated $190,438 in cash.  

  As
of September 30, 2016 and the date of this report, we have insufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for
the next twelve months and insufficient cash to achieve our business goals. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
our ability to obtain additional financing and to generate profits and positive cash flow. We will require additional cash of
$2,000,000 over the next twelve months to cover the costs of overhead and operations, drug manufacturing, maintaining our patent
portfolio, and conducting clinical trials for the indication Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ). We intend to raise the
required capital pursuant to private debt or equity financings in the near term, but there is no guarantee or assurances that
we will be able to do so.   

   Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

  As
of September 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

   Going
Concern   

  We
have negative working capital and have not yet received revenues from sales of products or services. These factors create substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary
if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

  Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on generating cash from the sale of our common stock and/or obtaining debt
financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management s plans include selling our equity securities and obtaining
debt financing to fund our capital requirement and ongoing operations; however, there can be no assurance we will be successful
in these efforts.

    Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

  We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

  A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

    Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

  We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered
by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we were not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
such weaknesses, and subject to our ability to obtain additional funding, we plan to implement the following changes during our
fiscal year ending March 31, 2016: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and
ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.
The remediation efforts set out are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material
manner.  

    Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

     Item
1A: Risk Factors.  An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the
risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this quarterly report on Form 10Q, before making
an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
You should read the above section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of what types of statements
are forward-looking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report.  

Risks
Related To Our Business   

We
are a development stage company and may never commercialize any of our products or services or earn a profit.   Prior to
July 19, 2013, we were a  shell  company with no or nominal operations. We recently became funded and commenced operations.
We are a development stage company in the business of developing treatments for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). We currently
have no products ready for commercialization, have not generated any revenue from operations and expect to incur substantial net
losses for the foreseeable future to further develop and commercialize our technology. We cannot predict the extent of these future
net losses, or when we may attain profitability, if at all. If we are unable to generate significant revenue from our technology
or attain profitability, we will not be able to sustain operations. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated
with developing and commercializing our technology, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become
profitable, if ever. We may never become profitable and you may never receive a return on an investment in our common stock. An
investor in our common stock must carefully consider the substantial challenges, risks and uncertainties inherent in the attempted
development and commercialization of medical treatments. We may never successfully commercialize our technology, and our business
may fail.  

We
will need to raise substantial additional capital to commercialize our technology, and our failure to obtain funding when needed
may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or collaboration efforts.   As of the date of
this Annual Report on Form 10K, we have limited cash resources. Due to our expectation that we will continue to incur losses
in the future, we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our technology.
During the next 12 months and potentially thereafter, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development
and commercialization of our technology. When we seek additional capital, we may seek to sell additional equity and/or debt securities
or to obtain a credit facility, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional
financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment.
If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back
or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our technologies, restrict our operations or obtain
funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms.  

Our
ability to successfully commercialize our technology will depend largely upon the extent to which third-party payors reimburse
the costs for our treatment in the future. Physicians and patients may decide not to order our products unless third-party payors,
such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid pay a substantial portion of the
price of the treatment. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor s determination
that our product candidates are:  

not experimental or investigational;  

effective;  

medically necessary;  

appropriate for the specific patient;  

cost-effective;  

supported by peer-reviewed publications; and  

included in clinical practice guidelines.  

Table of Contents        

Market
acceptance, sales of products based upon our technology, and our profitability may depend on reimbursement policies and health
care reform measures. Several entities conduct technology assessments of medical treatments and provide the results of their assessments
for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and health care providers as
grounds to deny coverage for a treatment or procedure. The levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such
as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, may reimburse the price patients pay for such products could
affect whether we are able to commercialize our products. Our technology may receive negative assessments that may impact our
ability to receive reimbursement of the treatment. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy
to reimburse a treatment, seeking these approvals may be a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be sure that reimbursement
in the U.S. or elsewhere will be available for any of our products in the future. If reimbursement is not available or is limited,
we may not be able to commercialize our products.  

If
we are unable to obtain reimbursement approval from private payors and Medicare and Medicaid programs for our product candidates,
or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues could be limited. Even if we are being reimbursed,
insurers may withdraw their coverage policies or cancel their contracts with us at any time, stop paying for our treatment or
reduce the payment rate for our treatment, which would reduce our revenue.  

The
commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of these products among physicians,
patients, health care payors and the medical community.   The use of our treatment technology has never been commercialized
for any indication. Even if approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory authorities, physicians may not order treatment based
upon out technology, in which event we may be unable to generate significant revenue or become profitable. Acceptance of our technology
will depend on a number of factors including:  

acceptance of products based upon our technology by physicians and patients;  

successful integration into clinical practice;  

adequate reimbursement by third parties;  

cost effectiveness;  

potential advantages over alternative treatments; and  

relative convenience and ease of administration.  

We
will need to make leading physicians aware of the benefits of using our technology through published papers, presentations at
scientific conferences and favorable results from our clinical studies. In addition, we will need to gain support from thought
leaders who believe that our treatment will provide superior results. Ideally, we will need these individuals to publish support
papers and articles which will be necessary to gain acceptance of our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to
obtain this support. Our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners
to order our treatment for their patients and consequently our revenue and profitability will be limited.  

If
our potential treatments are unable to compete effectively with current and future treatments targeting similar markets as our
potential products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.   The medical treatment industry for AML
and stroke is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress. In each of our potential product areas,
we face significant competition from large biotechnology, medical diagnostic and other companies. The technologies associated
with the medical industry are evolving rapidly and there is intense competition within such industry. Certain companies have established
technologies that may be competitive to our technology and any future products that we develop. Some of these competing companies
may use different approaches or means to obtain results, which could be more effective or less expensive than our treatments.
Moreover, these and other future competitors have or may have considerably greater resources than we do in terms of technology,
sales, marketing, commercialization and capital resources. These competitors may have substantial advantages over us in terms
of research and development expertise, experience in clinical studies, experience in regulatory issues, brand name exposure and
expertise in sales and marketing as well as in operating central laboratory services. Many of these organizations have financial,
marketing and human resources greater than ours; therefore, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with present
or potential competitors or that such competition will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position
or results of operations.  

Since
our technology is under development, we cannot predict the relative competitive position of any product based upon the technology.
However, we expect that the following factors will determine our ability to compete effectively: safety and efficacy; product
price; turnaround time; ease of administration; performance; reimbursement; and marketing and sales capability.  

If
our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of our technologies, we may never sell our products and services.   The
results of our clinical studies may not show that treatment results using our technology are superior to existing treatment. In
that event, we will have to devote significant financial and other resources to further research and development, and commercialization
of products using our technologies will be delayed or may never occur.

If
we do not receive regulatory approvals, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our technology.   We will need FDA
approval to market products based on our technology in the United States and approvals from foreign regulatory authorities to
market products based on our technology outside the United States. We have not yet filed an application with the FDA to obtain
approval to market any of our proposed products. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of products based
on our technology, we will be unable to sell such products and will not be able to sustain operations. The regulatory review and
approval process, which may include evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical trials of products based on our technology,
as well as the evaluation of manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers  facilities, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain.
Securing regulatory approval for products based upon our technology may require the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical
data and supporting information to regulatory authorities to establish such products  safety and effectiveness for each
indication. We have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals.  

Regulatory
authorities generally have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept an application, or may
decide after review of an application that the data submitted is insufficient to allow approval of any product based upon our
technology. If regulatory authorities do not accept or approve our applications, they may require that we conduct additional clinical,
preclinical or manufacturing studies and submit that data before regulatory authorities will reconsider such application. We may
need to expend substantial resources to conduct further studies to obtain data that regulatory authorities believe is sufficient.
Depending on the extent of these studies, approval of applications may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend
more resources than we may have available. It is also possible that additional studies may not suffice to make applications approvable.
If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our applications for approval, which might cause us to cease operations.  

If
we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies,
which would impair our competitive advantage.   We will rely on patent protection as well as a combination of copyright
and trade secret protection, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide
limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail
to protect our intellectual property, we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be
able to compete more effectively against us. We cannot assure you that the patent issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated
or held unenforceable. We cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made in connection with our
patent and any future patent applications. In addition to our patent and any future patent applications, we will rely on contractual
restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. We will require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements
and employees to also sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us. Nevertheless,
we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights.   

We
may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property
rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.   The inventor of the intellectual property
which was assigned to the Company in July 2013 by Imagic, LLC and Richard L. Chang s Holdings, LLC is presently in declaratory
relief litigation with Biosuccess Biotech, Co. LTD. ( Biosuccess ), a company who was previously assigned licensing
rights in the intellectual property. In connection with this litigation, on January 17, 2014, the Company received notice of a
complaint filed by Biosuccess against the Company, Imagic, LLC, Richard L. Chang s Holdings, LLC, and Ben Chang (our CEO
and a director) in the United States District Court, Central District of California Western Division (the  District Court ).
The Complaint includes allegations of patent and copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary
duty, unfair competition and other causes of actions against the Company, Imagic, LLC, Richard L. Chang s Holdings, LLC,
and Ben Chang (the  Litigation ). The Complaint seeks relief which includes compensatory damages, attorneys 
fees and costs, an award of treble damages, and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. As previously disclosed
on January 4, 2016, the Litigation has been settled through a confidential mediation process supervised by the Federal Court
and the Litigation has been dismissed with prejudice by the Federal Court .  The Company incurred substantial legal fees
in defending the Litigation.  

Also,
our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such
patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents
covering such technologies. There may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to
our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes. If another party has filed a United States patent
application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States
Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial,
and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect
to such inventions. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other
remedies if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter
into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may also become
subject to injunctions against the further development and use of our technology, which would have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex
patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties
resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise
the funds necessary to continue our operations.  

Table of Contents        

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.   We have generated
losses to date and have limited working capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. The report of our independent
registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern in their audit report included herein. If we cannot generate the required revenues and gross margin to achieve
profitability or obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we will need to substantially revise our business plan or cease
operations and an investor could suffer the loss of a significant portion or all of his investment in our Company.  

We
do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends and, consequently, the only opportunity
for investors to achieve a return on their investment is if a trading market develops and investors are able to sell their shares
for a profit or if our business is sold at a price that enables investors to recognize a profit.     We currently intend
to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends
for the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking
into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans
and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our
common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, we cannot assure investors any return on their investment, other than in
connection with a sale of their shares or a sale of our business. At the present time there is a limited trading market for our
shares. Therefore, holders of our securities may be unable to sell them. We cannot assure investors that an active trading market
will develop or that any third party will offer to purchase our business on acceptable terms and at a price that would enable
our investors to recognize a profit.  

Corporate
and Other Risks   

Limitations
on director and officer liability and indemnification of our Company s officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders
from bringing suit against an officer or director.    Our Company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide,
with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or
our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct,
fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing
suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders
on our behalf against a director.  

We
are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.   Should our officers and/or directors require us
to contribute to their defense, we may be required to spend significant amounts of our capital. Our certificate of incorporation
and bylaws also provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances,
against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their
association with or activities on behalf of our Company. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures,
which we may be unable to recoup. If these expenditures are significant, or involve issues which result in significant liability
for our key personnel, we may be unable to continue operating as a going concern.  

Certain
provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-of-control.  
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred
stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors
without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights,
redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our
common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders
of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of the Board
of Directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire
or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable
offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.  

The
issuance of Preferred Stock to our Chief Executive Officer provides him with voting control which may limit your ability and the
ability of our other stockholders, whether acting alone or together, to propose or direct the management or overall direction
of our Company.   Our Chief Executive Officer has 6,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock which provide him with 100 to 1 voting
rights over shares of common stock. This ownership provides him with voting control over matters which require shareholder approval.
This concentration of voting power could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our Company that might otherwise result
in an investor receiving a premium over the market price for his shares. If you acquire shares of our common stock, you may have
no effective voice in the management of our Company.  Such concentrated control of our Company may adversely affect the price
of our common stock. Our principal stockholders may be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including
the election of directors, mergers or other business combinations. Such concentrated control may also make it difficult for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event we merge with a third party or enter into
different transactions which require stockholder approval. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be
willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.   

We
are dependent for our success on a few key individuals.    Our success depends on the skills, experience and performance
of key members of our management team.  Each of those individuals may voluntarily terminate his relationship with the Company
at any time. Were we to lose one or more of these key individuals, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in
the pursuit of a replacement, which would result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion
of limited working capital. We do not maintain a key man insurance policy on any of our executive officers.

Capital
Market Risks   

Our
common stock recently commenced trading and has limited volume and high price volatility, so you may be unable to sell your shares
to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.    The Company s common stock commenced trading
March 14, 2014 on the OTC Markets. The trading volume has been very limited by the fact that many major institutional investment
funds, including mutual funds, as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in OTC stocks and certain major
brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending OTC stocks because they are considered speculative, volatile, thinly
traded and the market price of the common stock may not accurately reflect our underlying value. The market price of our common
stock is subject to wide fluctuations, and may be subject to further fluctuations based on announcements of new products or services
by us, significant sales of our common stock, including  short  sales, the operating and stock price performance of
other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic
conditions.  

The
application of the  penny stock  rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock,
adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. A  s long
as the trading price of our common stock is below $5 per share, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to
the  penny stock  rules, unless we otherwise qualify for an exemption from the  penny stock  definition.
The  penny stock  rules impose additional sales practice requirements on certain broker-dealers who sell securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). These regulations, if they apply, require the delivery, prior
to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks.
Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain
accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser s
written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our
common stock, reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock and increasing the transaction costs for sales and purchases
of our common stock as compared to other securities. The stock market in general and the market prices for penny stock companies
in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These
broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance.  Stockholders
should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Release No. 34-29093, the market for
penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include 1) control of the market for
the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 2) manipulation of prices through
prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure
sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; 4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential
and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after
prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent
investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.  

We
may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms, which could have a material adverse impact on the market value
of our common stock.    Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our common stock since
there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. The absence of such coverage limits the
likelihood that an active market will develop for our common stock. It will also likely make it more difficult to attract new
investors at times when we require additional capital.  

We
may be unable to list our common stock on NASDAQ or on any securities exchange.   Although we may apply to list our
common stock on NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial
listing standards, including the minimum per share price and minimum capitalization requirements, or that we will be able to maintain
a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other trading venue. If our common stock begins trading, until such time
as we would qualify for listing on NASDAQ, the American Stock Exchange or another trading venue, our common stock would trade
on OTC Markets or OTC Bulletin Board or another over-the-counter quotation system where an investor may find it more difficult
to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, rules promulgated
by the SEC impose various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities that fail to meet certain criteria set forth
in those rules to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.  Consequently, if our common stock begins
trading, these rules may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity
of our common stock. It would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.  

Future
sales and issuances of our equity securities could put downward selling pressure on our securities, and adversely affect the stock
price.   There is a risk that this downward pressure may make it impossible for an investor to sell his or her securities
at any reasonable price, if at all. Future sales of substantial amounts of our equity securities in the public market, or the
perception that such sales could occur, could put downward selling pressure on our securities, and adversely affect the market
price of our common stock.  

Conversion
of our convertible notes into common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.   We have issued convertible
notes which are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices which are at a discount to the then current trading
price of our common stock. Additionally, upon the occurrence of certain events of default (including conditions outside of our
control) the note holders are entitled to increased repayment and interest rates, as well as other remedies. The note holders
have anti-dilution and conversion reset provisions which are triggered by the issuance of lower priced securities. The Company
has issued a significant number of shares of common stock as a result of the conversion of these convertible notes and expects
to continue to issue a significant number of shares in the future. A significant portion of these additional share issuances resulted
from the conversion of convertible notes. As shares of our common stock are issued due to the conversion of some or all of the
convertible notes in the future, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will continue to be diluted and such dilution
is expected to be significant.  

Table of Contents        

Events
of Default under our convertible notes could result in a judgment against the Company and a foreclosure on all of our assets.
  We have issued convertible notes which have remedies to the note holder which include a confession of judgment against
us in the event of a default. We are currently in default under these convertible notes for our failure to timely file our public
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The exercise of rights by the note holder for this event of default could
result in a judgment against us and the foreclosure upon all of our assets which would have a material adverse effect on the Company
and the price of its shares.  

The
Company s common stock was the subject of an unauthorized spam stock promotion.   In April 2014, the Company was made
aware of spam stock promotion regarding shares of the Company. The Company received complaints, and was forwarded emails and links
to social media sites, relating to unsolicited messages containing false and misleading information regarding the Company and
its stock price. The spam mails touted RCHA as   the opportunity of the year   that could go past   2 or
3 dollars  . The Company did not, and does not, authorize, endorse or sponsor these illegal spam stock promotions or any
of the information contained in the emails. However, the spam stock promotions caused the OTC Markets to place a skull and crossbones
next to the Company s stock symbol on the OTC Markets website warning investors with respect to the Company s stock,
and may have caused reputational damage to the Company and its stock. The Company does not have the ability to stop or restrict
any future spam stock promotions which may occur and any such future promotions could have an adverse effect on the Company and
its share price.
