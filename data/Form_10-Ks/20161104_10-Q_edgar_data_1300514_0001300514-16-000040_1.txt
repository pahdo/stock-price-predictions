  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OF COMPANY 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Las Vegas Sands Corp. ( LVSC ), a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively the  Company ) for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations; however, the Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period have been included. The interim results reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of expected results for the full year. The Company s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  LVS.  
  The ordinary shares of the Company s subsidiary, Sands China Ltd. ( SCL,  the indirect owner and operator of the majority of the Company s operations in the Macao Special Administrative Region ( Macao ) of the People s Republic of China), are listed on The Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ( SEHK ). The shares were not, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent a registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an applicable exception from such registration requirements. 
  Operations 
  Macao 
  The Company currently owns   70.1%   of SCL, which includes the operations of The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel ("The Venetian Macao"); Sands Cotai Central; The Parisian Macao, as further described below; Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Cotai Strip (the "Four Seasons Hotel Macao") and the Plaza Casino (together with the Four Seasons Hotel Macao, the "Four Seasons Macao"); Sands Macao; and other ancillary operations that support these properties. The Company operates the gaming areas within these properties pursuant to a   20  -year gaming subconcession agreement, which expires in   June 2022  . 
  On September 13, 2016, the Company opened The Parisian Macao, an integrated resort connected to The Venetian Macao and Four Seasons Macao, which includes a   253,000     square foot casino. The Parisian Macao also features approximately   3,000   rooms and suites; approximately   340,000     square feet of retail and dining space; a meeting room complex of approximately   63,000     square feet; and a   1,200  -seat theater. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded pre-opening costs at The Parisian Macao of   $86.1 million   and   $124.9 million  , respectively. 
  Singapore 
  The Company owns and operates the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. In April 2016, the Company paid   66.0 million   Singapore dollars ("SGD," approximately   $48.4 million   at exchange rates in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) to the Singapore Casino Regulatory Authority as part of the process to renew its gaming license at Marina Bay Sands for a three-year term and such license now expires in   April 2019  . 
  United States 
  The Company owns and operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino ( The Venetian Las Vegas ), The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino ( The Palazzo ) and an expo and convention center (the  Sands Expo Center ) in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem (the  Sands Bethlehem ) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Development Projects 
  Macao 
  The Company is completing the development of certain open areas surrounding its Cotai Strip properties. Under the Company s land concessions for Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao, the Company is required to complete these developments by December 2016 and January 2017 (which was extended by the Macao government from November 2016), respectively. Should the Company determine it is unable to complete Sands Cotai Central or The Parisian Macao by their respective deadlines, the Company would then expect to apply for another extension from the Macao government to the extent necessary. If the Company is unable to meet the current deadlines and the deadlines for either development are not extended, the Company could lose its land concessions for Sands Cotai Central or The Parisian Macao, which would prohibit the Company from operating any facilities developed under the respective land concessions. As a result, the Company could record a charge for all or some portion of its   $4.90 billion   or   $2.62 billion   in capitalized construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization), as of   September 30, 2016  , related to Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao, respectively. 
  United States 
  The Company was constructing a high-rise residential condominium tower (the  Las Vegas Condo Tower ), located on the Las Vegas Strip between The Palazzo and The Venetian Las Vegas. The Company suspended construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for Las Vegas Strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions. The Company is evaluating the highest return opportunity for the project and intends to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve. The impact of the suspension on the estimated overall cost of the project is currently not determinable with certainty. Should demand and conditions fail to improve or management decides to abandon the project, the Company could record a charge for some portion of the   $178.6 million   in capitalized construction costs as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other 
  The Company continues to pursue new development opportunities globally. 
  Capital Financing Overview 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has funded its development projects primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities, operating cash flows, proceeds from its equity offerings and proceeds from the disposition of non-core assets. 
  The Company held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $1.79 billion   and restricted cash and cash equivalents of   $9.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company believes the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of its credit facilities. In the normal course of its activities, the Company will continue to evaluate its capital structure and opportunities for enhancements thereof. In June 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to amend its Macao credit facility, which became effective in August 2016. This agreement extended the maturity of a portion of the term loans under the facility to   May 2022   and provides for additional term loan commitments of   $1.0 billion   (see "  Note 3   Long-Term Debt   2016 VML Credit Facility ). In August 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to amend its U.S. credit facility, which extended the maturity of a portion of the revolving credit commitments under the facility to   September 2020   (see "  Note 3   Long-Term Debt  2013 U.S. Credit Facility).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standard update on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In April 2016, the FASB issued an additional update that adds clarifying guidance to assist an entity with identifying performance obligations in contracts with customers and implementing licensing contracts with customers. The guidance will be required to be applied on a retrospective basis, using one of two methodologies, and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method, to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. If the net realizable value of inventory is lower than its cost, the difference shall be recognized as a loss during the period in which it occurs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on leases, which requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach must be applied for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective approach depending on the specific portion of the guidance being applied. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to reduce the diversity on how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, and should be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   
  Reclassification 
  The Company adopted the accounting standard update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs as of January 1, 2016, on a retrospective basis. As a result, debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of   $169.7 million   were reclassified from deferred financing costs, net to long-term debt and other assets, net. Debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of   $124.0 million   related to the Company's term loans were reclassified to long-term debt and debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of   $45.7 million   related to the Company's revolving debt were reclassified to other assets, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The reclassification did not have an effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 2   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET 
  Property and equipment consists of the following (in thousands): 

Construction in progress consists of the following (in thousands): 

The   $378.8 million   in other construction in progress as of   September 30, 2016  , consists primarily of construction of the Las Vegas Condo Tower and various projects at The Venetian Macao. 
  In accordance with the April 2004 purchase and sale agreement, as amended, between Venetian Casino Resort, LLC ( VCR ) and GGP Limited Partnership ("GGP") (the  Amended Agreement ), the Company sold the portion of the Grand Canal Shoppes located within The Palazzo (formerly referred to as "The Shoppes at the Palazzo"). Under the terms of the settlement with GGP on June 24, 2011, the Company retained the   $295.4 million   of proceeds previously received and participates in certain potential future revenues earned by GGP. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the transaction has not been accounted for as a sale because the Company s participation in certain potential future revenues constitutes continuing involvement. Therefore,   $266.2 million   of the proceeds allocated to the mall sale transaction has been recorded as deferred proceeds (a long-term financing obligation), which will accrue interest at an imputed rate and will be offset by (i) imputed rental income and (ii) rent payments made to GGP related to spaces leased back from GGP by the Company. The property and equipment legally sold to GGP totaling   $203.7 million   (net of   $96.3 million   of accumulated depreciation) as of   September 30, 2016  , will continue to be recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be depreciated in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company capitalized interest expense of   $11.4 million  ,   $32.6 million  ,   $7.1 million   and   $16.8 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company capitalized approximately   $7.2 million  ,   $21.6 million  ,   $7.0 million   and   $22.6 million  , respectively, of internal costs, consisting primarily of compensation expense for individuals directly involved with the development and construction of property.

NOTE 3   LONG-TERM DEBT 
  Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands): 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    Unamortized deferred financing costs of   $37.2 million   and   $45.7 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the U.S., Macao and Singapore revolving credit facilities are included in other assets, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
       
  2013 U.S. Credit Facility 
  During August 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Amendment Agreement") to amend the existing 2013 U.S. Credit Facility, to among other things, obtain revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of   $1.15 billion   (the "2013 Extended U.S. Revolving Facility"), which mature on   September 19, 2020  , and were used to replace the commitments under, and refinance all amounts outstanding under, the existing 2013 U.S. Revolving Facility and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment. Borrowings under the 2013 Extended U.S. Revolving Facility will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $1.15 billion   of available borrowing capacity under the 2013 Extended U.S. Revolving Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit.  
  The revolving loans bear interest, at the Company's option, at either an adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus a credit spread, or an alternative base rate, plus a credit spread, which credit spread in each case is determined based on the Company's corporate family rating as set forth in the pricing grid in the Amendment Agreement (the "Corporate Rating"). The credit spread ranges from   0.125%   to   0.625%   per annum for loans accruing interest at the base rate and from   1.125%   to   1.625%   per annum for loans accruing interest at an adjusted Eurodollar rate. The initial credit spread is   0.45%   per

annum for loans accruing interest at a base rate and   1.45%   per annum for loans accruing interest at an adjusted Eurodollar rate.  
  The Company pays a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts under the 2013 Extended U.S. Revolving Facility. The commitment fee is determined based on the Corporate Rating and ranges from   0.125%   to   0.25%   per annum. The initial commitment fee is   0.20%   per annum. Other than the items noted above, the terms and conditions of the existing 2013 U.S. Credit Facility remain unchanged.  
  The Company recorded a   $1.6 million   loss on early retirement of debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the Amendment Agreement. 
  2016 VML Credit Facility 
  During June 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the "VML Amendment Agreement") to amend its 2011 VML Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity of a portion of the then existing term loans, modify the scheduled amortization payment dates of such term loans and obtain new term loan commitments (as so amended and restated, the "Restated VML Credit Agreement"). The Restated VML Credit Agreement became effective on August 31, 2016, upon satisfaction of all closing conditions (the "Restatement Date"). Pursuant to the Restated VML Credit Agreement and as of the Restatement Date, certain lenders extended the maturity of existing term loans (the "Extended Initial VML Term Loans") to   May 31, 2022  , the balance of which is   $3.12 billion   in aggregate principal amount consisting of   $2.12 billion   related to the Extended 2011 VML Term Facility and   $1.0 billion   related to the 2011 VML Accordion Term. In addition, certain lenders provided   $1.0 billion   in aggregate principal amount of new term loan commitments with a maturity date of   May 31, 2022   (the  New VML Term Loans,  and together with the Extended Initial VML Term Loans, the "2016 VML Term Loans," an aggregate principal amount of   $4.12 billion  ). The terms and the maturity date of the balance of the term loans under the 2011 VML Credit Facility that are not 2016 VML Term Loans (the  2016 Non-Extended VML Term Loans ) in the amount of   $269.3 million   and the   $2.0 billion   Extended 2011 VML Revolving Facility remain unchanged (the "2016 VML Revolving Facility," and together with the 2016 VML Term Loans and the 2016 Non-Extended VML Term Loans, the "2016 VML Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the 2016 VML Term Loans will be used for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including to make any investment or payment not specifically prohibited by the terms of the loan documents. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.0 billion   of available borrowing capacity under the 2016 VML Revolving Facility.  
  Commencing with the quarterly period ending March 31, 2020, and at the end of each subsequent quarter through December 31, 2020, the Restated VML Credit Agreement requires the borrower to repay the outstanding 2016 VML Term Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to   2.5%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of the Restatement Date. For the quarterly periods ending on March 31 through June 30, 2021, the borrower is required to repay the outstanding 2016 VML Term Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to   5.0%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of the Restatement Date. For the quarterly periods ending on September 30 through December 31, 2021, the borrower is required to repay the outstanding 2016 VML Term Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to   12.5%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of the Restatement Date. For the quarterly period ending on March 31, 2022, the borrower is required to repay the outstanding 2016 VML Term Loans on a pro rata basis in an amount equal to   20.0%   of the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of the Restatement Date. The remaining balance on the 2016 VML Term Loans is due on the maturity date. 
  The 2016 VML Term Loans and the 2016 Non-Extended VML Term Loans both bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the adjusted Eurodollar rate or Hong Kong Inter-bank Offered Rate ( HIBOR ), plus a credit spread, or an alternative base rate, plus a credit spread, which credit spread in each case is determined based on the consolidated total leverage ratio as set forth in the Restated VML Credit Agreement. The credit spread ranges from   0.25%   to   1.125%   per annum for loans accruing interest at the base rate and from   1.25%   to   2.125%   per annum for loans accruing interest at an adjusted Eurodollar or HIBOR rate. The initial credit spread is   0.875%   per annum for loans accruing interest at a base rate and   1.875%   per annum for loans accruing interest at an adjusted Eurodollar or HIBOR rate.  
  The Company recorded a   $1.8 million   loss on modification of debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the VML Amendment Agreement.

Company s common stock are made at the Company s discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

On February 27 and July 15, 2015, SCL paid a dividend of HKD   0.99   and HKD   1.00   per share, respectively, to SCL shareholders (a total of   $2.07 billion  , of which the Company retained   $1.45 billion  ).

  Earnings Per Share 
  The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share consisted of the following: 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted solely of foreign currency translation adjustments. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a   $5.3 million   gain related to the dissolution of a wholly owned foreign subsidiary was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and comprehensive income to net income. The amount is included in other income (expense) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  NOTE 5   VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
  The Company consolidates any variable interest entities ( VIEs ) in which it is the primary beneficiary and discloses significant variable interests in VIEs for which it is not the primary beneficiary, if any, which designation is determined based on accounting standards for VIEs. 
  The Company has entered into various joint venture agreements with independent third parties. The operations of these joint ventures have been consolidated by the Company due to the Company s significant investment in these joint ventures, its power to direct the activities of the joint ventures that would significantly impact their economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the rights to receive potentially significant

benefits from these joint ventures. The Company evaluates its primary beneficiary designation on an ongoing basis and assesses the appropriateness of the VIE s status when events have occurred that would trigger such an analysis. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s consolidated joint ventures had total assets of   $79.6 million   and   $79.4 million  , respectively, and total liabilities of   $167.8 million   and   $148.4 million  , respectively. 
   
  NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Macao and Singapore. The Company is subject to examination for tax years beginning   2010   in the U.S. and Singapore, and tax years beginning in   2011   in Macao. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore is performing a compliance review of the Marina Bay Sands tax return for tax years   2010   through   2012  . The Company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions; however, there is no assurance that the taxing authorities will not propose adjustments that are different from the Company s expected outcome, which may impact the provision for income taxes. 
  The Company does not consider current year s tax earnings and profits of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s major foreign subsidiaries distributed, and may continue to distribute, earnings in excess of their current year s tax earnings and profits in order to meet the Company s liquidity needs. The Company has not provided deferred taxes for foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in the applicable foreign jurisdictions. The Company expects there will be sufficient creditable foreign taxes to offset any U.S. income tax that would result from the repatriation of these foreign earnings. The Company recorded valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets of its U.S. operations and certain foreign jurisdictions. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period and to the extent it becomes  more-likely-than-not  that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made. 
  In October 2013, the Company received a   5  -year income tax exemption in Macao that exempts the Company from paying corporate income tax on profits generated by gaming operations. The Company will continue to benefit from this tax exemption through the   end of 2018  . In May 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with the Macao government, effective through the   end of 2018  , that provides for an annual payment of   42.4 million   patacas (approximately   $5.3 million   at exchange rates in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) that is a substitution for a   12%   tax otherwise due from Venetian Macau Limited ( VML ) shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits.

NOTE 7   STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION 
  Stock-based compensation activity under the LVSC 2004 and SCL Equity Plans is as follows (in thousands, except weighted average grant date fair values): 

There were   no   cash-settled awards paid on vested restricted stock units during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , SCL paid   $1.4 million   to settle vested restricted stock units that were previously classified as equity awards. During the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, SCL paid   $0.4 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, to settle vested restricted stock units that were previously classified as equity awards.   
  The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

NOTE 8   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance also establishes a valuation hierarchy for inputs in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs (inputs market participants would use based on market data obtained from

sources independent of the Company) and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs (inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions based upon the best information available in the circumstances) by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities. Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
  The Company currently uses certain derivatives as effective economic hedges to offset foreign currency forward contracts to manage its foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency forward contracts involve the purchase and sale of a designated currency at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date. The aggregate notional value of these foreign currency contracts was   $497.6 million   and   $672.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As these derivatives have not been designated and/or do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in fair value are recognized as other income (expense) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value (in thousands):

    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   20   and   19   foreign currency forward contracts, respectively, with fair values based on recently reported market transactions of forward rates. Assets were included in prepaid expenses and other and liabilities were included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a   $10.0 million   gain and   $18.1 million   loss, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the forward contracts. The Company did not have forward contracts during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   interest rate cap agreements.

NOTE 9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Litigation 
  The Company is involved in other litigation in addition to those noted below, arising in the normal course of business. Management has made certain estimates for potential litigation costs based upon consultation with legal counsel. Actual results could differ from these estimates; however, in the opinion of management, such litigation and claims will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  On October 15, 2004, Richard Suen and Round Square Company Limited ( Roundsquare ) filed an action against LVSC, Las Vegas Sands, Inc. ( LVSI ), Sheldon G. Adelson and William P. Weidner in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada (the  District Court ), asserting a breach of an alleged agreement to pay a success fee of   $5.0 million   and   2.0%   of the net profit from the Company s Macao resort operations to the plaintiffs as well as other related claims. In March 2005, LVSC was dismissed as a party without prejudice based on a stipulation to do so between the parties. Pursuant to an order filed March 16, 2006, plaintiffs  fraud claims set forth in the first amended complaint were dismissed with prejudice against all defendants. The order also dismissed with prejudice the first amended complaint against defendants Sheldon G. Adelson and William P. Weidner. On May 24, 2008, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs in the amount of   $43.8 million  . On June 30, 2008, a judgment was entered in this matter in the amount of   $58.6 million   (including pre-judgment interest). The Company appealed the verdict to the Nevada Supreme Court. On November 17, 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. In its decision reversing the monetary judgment against the Company, the Nevada Supreme Court also made several other rulings, including overturning the pre-trial dismissal of the plaintiffs  breach of contract claim and deciding several evidentiary matters, some of which confirmed and some of which overturned rulings made by the District Court. On February 27, 2012, the District Court set a date of March 25, 2013, for the new trial. On June 22, 2012, the defendants filed a request to add experts and plaintiffs filed a motion seeking additional financial data as part of their discovery. The District Court granted both requests. The retrial began on March 27 and on May 14, 2013, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Roundsquare in the amount of   $70.0 million  . On May 28, 2013, a judgment was entered in the matter in the amount of   $101.6 million   (including pre-judgment interest). On June 7, 2013, the Company filed a motion with the District Court requesting that the judgment be set aside as a matter of law or in the alternative that a new trial be granted. On July 30, 2013, the District Court denied the Company s motion. On October 17, 2013, the District Court entered an order granting plaintiff's request for certain costs and fees associated with the litigation in the amount of approximately   $1.0 million  . On December 6, 2013, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the jury verdict with the Nevada Supreme Court. The Company filed its opening appellate brief with the Nevada Supreme Court on June 16, 2014. On August 19, 2014, the Nevada Supreme Court issued an order granting plaintiffs additional time until September 15, 2014, to file their answering brief. On September 15, 2014, Roundsquare filed a request to the Nevada Supreme Court to file a brief exceeding the maximum number of words, which was granted. On October 10, 2014, Roundsquare filed their answering brief. On January 12, 2015, the defendants filed their reply brief. On January 27, 2015, Roundsquare filed their reply brief. The Nevada Supreme Court set oral argument for December 17, 2015, before a panel of justices only to reset it for January 26, 2016, en banc. Oral arguments were presented to the Nevada Supreme Court as scheduled. On March 11, 2016, the Nevada Supreme Court issued an order affirming the judgment of liability, but reversing the damages award and remanding for a new trial on damages. On March 29, 2016, Roundsquare filed a petition for rehearing. The Nevada Supreme Court ordered an answer by the Company, which the Company filed on May 4, 2016. On May 12, 2016, Roundsquare filed a motion for leave to file a reply brief in support of their petition for rehearing, and on May 19, 2016, the Company filed an opposition to that motion. On June 24, 2016, the Nevada Supreme Court issued an order granting Roundsquare's petition for rehearing and submitting the appeal for decision on rehearing without further briefing or oral argument. On July 22, 2016, the Nevada Supreme Court once again ordered a new trial on the issue of damages. A pre-trial hearing has been set in District Court for December 12, 2016. The Company believes that the amount of any loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and has not recorded any reserves or contingencies related to this legal matter. In the event that the Company s assumptions used to evaluate this matter as neither probable nor estimable change in future periods, it may be required to record a liability for an adverse outcome. 
  On February 9, 2011, LVSC received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) requesting that the Company produce documents relating to its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the

FCPA ). The Company was also advised by the Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) that it is conducting a similar investigation. As previously disclosed by LVSC, on April 7, 2016, the SEC announced a comprehensive civil administrative settlement with LVSC in which LVSC neither admitted nor denied allegations related to the internal controls and books and records provisions of the FCPA pursuant to Section 21(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  SEC Order ). 
  The Company continues to respond to all remaining government inquiries. Based on the proceedings to date, management is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of the remaining inquiries, the extent of materiality, or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. 
  On May 24, 2010, Frank J. Fosbre, Jr. filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District Court, against LVSC, Sheldon G. Adelson, and William P. Weidner. The complaint alleged that LVSC, through the individual defendants, disseminated or approved materially false information, or failed to disclose material facts, through press releases, investor conference calls and other means from August 1, 2007 through November 6, 2008. The complaint sought, among other relief, class certification, compensatory damages and attorneys  fees and costs. On July 21, 2010, Wendell and Shirley Combs filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District Court, against LVSC, Sheldon G. Adelson, and William P. Weidner. The complaint alleged that LVSC, through the individual defendants, disseminated or approved materially false information, or failed to disclose material facts, through press releases, investor conference calls and other means from June 13, 2007 through November 11, 2008. The complaint, which was substantially similar to the Fosbre complaint, discussed above, sought, among other relief, class certification, compensatory damages and attorneys  fees and costs. On August 31, 2010, the U.S. District Court entered an order consolidating the Fosbre and Combs cases, and appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. As such, the Fosbre and Combs cases are reported as one consolidated matter. On November 1, 2010, a purported class action amended complaint was filed in the consolidated action against LVSC, Sheldon G. Adelson and William P. Weidner. The amended complaint alleges that LVSC, through the individual defendants, disseminated or approved materially false and misleading information, or failed to disclose material facts, through press releases, investor conference calls and other means from August 2, 2007 through November 6, 2008. The amended complaint seeks, among other relief, class certification, compensatory damages and attorneys  fees and costs. On January 10, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which, on August 24, 2011, was granted in part, and denied in part, with the dismissal of certain allegations. On November 7, 2011, the defendants filed their answer to the allegations remaining in the amended complaint. On July 11, 2012, the U.S. District Court issued an order allowing defendants  Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the U.S. District Court's order dated August 24, 2011, striking additional portions of the plaintiffs' complaint and reducing the class period to a period of February 4 to November 6, 2008. On August 7, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a purported class action second amended complaint (the  Second Amended Complaint ) seeking to expand their allegations back to a time period of 2007 (having previously been cut back to 2008 by the U.S. District Court) essentially alleging very similar matters that had been previously stricken by the U.S. District Court. On October 16, 2012, the defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs responded to the motion to dismiss on November 1, 2012, and defendants filed their reply on November 12, 2012. On November 20, 2012, the U.S. District Court granted a stay of discovery under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act pending a decision on the new motion to dismiss and therefore, the discovery process was suspended. On April 16, 2013, the case was reassigned to a new judge. On July 30, 2013, the U.S. District Court heard the motion to dismiss and took the matter under advisement. On November 7, 2013, the judge granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions to dismiss. On December 13, 2013, the defendants filed their answer to the Second Amended Complaint. Discovery in the matter resumed. On January 8, 2014, plaintiffs filed a motion to expand the certified class period, which was granted by the U.S. District Court on June 15, 2015. Fact discovery closed on July 31, 2015, and expert discovery closed on December 18, 2015. On January 22, 2016, defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motions for summary judgment on March 11, 2016. Defendants filed their replies in support of summary judgment on April 8, 2016. No hearing date for the summary judgment has been set. Management has determined that based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On March 9, 2011, Benyamin Kohanim filed a shareholder derivative action (the  Kohanim action ) on behalf of the Company in the District Court against Sheldon G. Adelson, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, George P. Koo, Michael A. Leven, Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Irwin A. Siegel, the members of the Board of Directors at the time. The complaint alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties in failing to properly implement, oversee and maintain internal controls to ensure compliance with the FCPA. The complaint seeks to recover for the Company unspecified damages, including restitution and disgorgement of profits, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the plaintiff. On April 18, 2011, Ira J. Gaines, Sunshine Wire and Cable Defined Benefit Pension Plan Trust dated 1/1/92 and Peachtree Mortgage Ltd. filed a shareholder derivative action (the  Gaines action ) on behalf of the Company in the District Court against Sheldon G. Adelson, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, George P. Koo, Michael A. Leven, Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Irwin A. Siegel, the members of the Board of Directors at the time. The complaint raises substantially similar claims as alleged in the Kohanim action. The complaint seeks to recover for the Company unspecified damages, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the plaintiffs. The Kohanim and Gaines actions have been consolidated and are reported as one consolidated matter. On July 25, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a first verified amended consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs have twice agreed to stay the proceedings. A 120-day stay was entered by the District Court in October 2011. It was extended for another 90 days in February 2012 and expired in May 2012. The parties agreed to an extension of the May 2012 deadline that expired on October 30, 2012. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on November 1, 2012, based on the fact that the plaintiffs have suffered no damages. On January 23, 2013, the District Court denied the motion to dismiss in part, deferred the remainder of the motion to dismiss and stayed the proceedings until July 22, 2013. The District Court has granted several successive stays since that time, with the case currently stayed until April 18, 2017.     This consolidated action is in a preliminary stage and management has determined that based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
  On April 1, 2011, Nasser Moradi, Richard Buckman, Douglas Tomlinson and Matt Abbeduto filed a shareholder derivative action (the  Moradi action ), as amended on April 15, 2011, on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court, against Sheldon G. Adelson, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, George P. Koo, Michael A. Leven, Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Irwin A. Siegel, the members of the Board of Directors at the time. The complaint raises substantially similar claims as alleged in the Kohanim and Gaines actions. The complaint seeks to recover for the Company unspecified damages, including exemplary damages and restitution, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the plaintiffs. On April 18, 2011, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System filed a shareholder derivative action (the  LAMPERS action ) on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court, against Sheldon G. Adelson, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, George P. Koo, Michael A. Leven, Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Irwin A. Siegel, the members of the Board of Directors at the time, and Wing T. Chao, a former member of the Board of Directors. The complaint raises substantially similar claims as alleged in the Kohanim, Moradi and Gaines actions. The complaint seeks to recover for the Company unspecified damages, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the plaintiff. On April 22, 2011, John Zaremba filed a shareholder derivative action (the  Zaremba action ) on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court, against Sheldon G. Adelson, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, George P. Koo, Michael A. Leven, Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Irwin A. Siegel, the members of the Board of Directors at the time, and Wing T. Chao, a former member of the Board of Directors. The complaint raises substantially similar claims as alleged in the Kohanim, Moradi, Gaines and LAMPERS actions. The complaint seeks to recover for the Company unspecified damages, including restitution, disgorgement of profits and injunctive relief, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the plaintiff. On August 25, 2011, the U.S. District Court consolidated the Moradi, LAMPERS and Zaremba actions and such actions are reported as one consolidated matter. On November 17, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay the federal action due to the parallel District Court action described above. On May 25, 2012, the case was transferred to a new judge. On August 27, 2012, the U.S. District Court granted the motion to stay pending a further update of the Special Litigation Committee due on October 30, 2012. On October 30, 2012, the defendants filed the update asking the judge to determine whether to continue the stay until January 31, 2013, or to address motions to dismiss. On November 7, 2012, the U.S. District Court denied defendants request for an extension of the stay but asked the parties to brief the motion to dismiss. On November 21, 2012, defendants filed their motion

to dismiss. On December 21, 2012, plaintiffs filed their opposition and on January 18, 2013, defendants filed their reply. On May 31, 2013, the case was reassigned to a new judge. On April 11, 2014, the judge denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered the case stayed pending the outcome of the District Court action in Kohanim described above. Following a January 22, 2016, status report by the parties, on January 27, 2016, the judge ordered another status report on May 16, 2016. Following the May 16, 2016 status report by the parties, on May 17, 2016, the judge ordered another status report on December 16, 2016. This consolidated action is in a preliminary stage and management has determined that based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
  On July 5, 2016, W.A. Sokolowski filed a shareholder derivative action ( Sokolowski III ) on purported behalf of the Company in the District Court, Clark County Nevada, against Sheldon G. Adelson, Michael A. Leven, Jason N. Ader, Irwin Chafetz, Charles D. Forman, Irwin A. Siegel, George P. Koo, Charles A. Koppelman, Jeffrey H. Schwartz, Robert G. Goldstein, Micheline Chau, Steven L. Gerard, George Jamieson, David Levi, and George P. Koo, each of whom is serving or previously served on the Board of Directors (collectively, the  Directors  as well as against PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ( PwC ), the Company s former auditor, and a partner of PwC. On September 16, 2016, Sokolowski filed an amended complaint ("Sokolowski IV") with additional nominal plaintiff Curtis Acton, adding former Director Wing T. Chau as a defendant. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by failing to prevent certain alleged misrepresentations and wrongdoing by the Company s management, wasting corporate assets in litigating the Jacobs lawsuit, and concealing certain alleged facts in connection with audits performed by PwC. The amended complaint seeks, among other things the appointment of a conservator or special master to oversee the Company s discussions with governmental agencies as well as to recover for the Company unspecified damages, including restitution and disgorgement of compensation, and also seeks to recover attorneys  fees, costs and related expenses for the nominal plaintiffs. Many of the allegations duplicate allegations Sokolowski made in a previous case, Sokolowski v. Adelson, No. 2:14-cv-00111-JCM-NJK (D. Nev.) ( Sokolowski I and II ), in which final judgment was entered against him. In Sokolowski IV, nominal plaintiffs also complain that the Company wrongfully caused Sokolowski to lose Sokolowski I and II. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on October 24, 2016. This matter is in a preliminary stage and management has determined that it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter, whether this matter will result in litigation or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
  On March 6, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company received a shareholder demand letter from a purported shareholder named the John F. Scarpa Foundation ("Scarpa"). This letter recites substantially the same allegations as the complaint filed in the Sokolowski I and II actions and demands that the same claims be asserted by the Company, which was delivered to the Company by the same counsel representing Mr. Sokolowski. The Company acknowledged, through its counsel, on March 26, 2014. Scarpa then sent a revised demand letter to the Board of Directors on March 31, 2014. The Company acknowledged, through its counsel, on April 8, 2014. Scarpa then sent an additional demand letter dated August 14, 2014, which the Company acknowledged on August 22, 2014. The Company responded to the demand by letters dated June 4, 2015. This matter is in a preliminary stage and management has determined that based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter, whether this matter will result in litigation or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
  On January 19, 2012, Asian American Entertainment Corporation, Limited ( AAEC ) filed a claim (the  Macao action ) with the Macao Judicial Court (Tribunal Judicial de Base) against VML, LVS (Nevada) International Holdings, Inc. ( LVS (Nevada) ), Las Vegas Sands, LLC ( LVSLLC ) and VCR (collectively, the  Defendants ). The claim is for   3.0 billion   patacas (approximately   $375.6 million   at exchange rates in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) as compensation for damages resulting from the alleged breach of agreements entered into between AAEC and LVS (Nevada), LVSLLC and VCR (collectively, the "U.S. Defendants") for their joint presentation of a bid in response to the public tender held by the Macao government for the award of gaming concessions at the end of 2001. On July 4, 2012, the Defendants filed their defense to the Macao action with the Macao Judicial Court. AAEC then filed a reply that included several amendments to the original claim, although the amount of the claim was not amended. On January 4, 2013, the

Defendants filed an amended defense to the amended claim with the Macao Judicial Court. On September 23, 2013, the U.S. Defendants filed a motion with the Macao Second Instance Court, seeking recognition and enforcement of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in the Prior Action, referred to below, given on April 10, 2009, which partially dismissed AAEC s claims against the U.S. Defendants. On April 24, 2014, the Macao Judicial Court issued a Decision (Despacho Seneador) holding that AAEC s claim against VML is unfounded and that VML be removed as a party to the proceedings, and that the claim should proceed exclusively against the U.S. Defendants. On May 8, 2014, AAEC lodged an appeal against that decision. The Macao Judicial Court further held that the existence of the pending application for recognition and enforcement of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling before the Macao Second Instance Court did not justify a stay of the proceedings against the U.S. Defendants at the present time, although in principle an application for a stay of the proceedings against the U.S. Defendants could be reviewed after the Macao Second Instance Court had issued its decision. On June 25, 2014, the Macao Second Instance Court delivered a decision, which gave formal recognition to and allowed enforcement in Macao of the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals, dismissing AAEC's claims against the U.S. Defendants. AAEC appealed against the recognition decision to the Macao Court of Final Appeal, which, on May 6, 2015, dismissed the appeal and held the U.S. judgment to be final and have preclusive effect. The Macao Court of Final Appeal's decision became final on May 21, 2015. On June 5, 2015, the U.S. Defendants applied to the Macao Judicial Court to dismiss the claims against them as res judicata. AAEC filed its response to that application on June 30, 2015. The U.S. Defendants filed their reply on July 23, 2015. On September 14, 2015, the Macao Judicial Court admitted two further legal opinions from Portuguese and U.S. law experts. On March 16, 2016, the Macao Judicial Court dismissed the defense of res judicata. An appeal against that decision was lodged on April 7, 2016, together with a request that the appeal be heard immediately. By a decision dated April 13, 2016, the Macao Judicial Court accepted that the appeal be heard immediately. Legal arguments were submitted May 23, 2016. AAEC replied to the legal arguments on or about July 14, 2016, which was three days late, upon payment of a penalty. The U.S. Defendants submitted a response on September 20, 2016. On March 25, 2015, application was made by the U.S. Defendants to the Macao Judicial Court to revoke the legal aid granted to AAEC, accompanied by a request for evidence taking from AAEC, relating to the fees and expenses that they incurred and paid in the U.S. subsequent action referred to below. The Macao Public Prosecutor has opposed the action on the ground of lack of evidence that AAEC's financial position has improved. No decision has been issued in respect to that application up to the present time. A complaint against AAEC's Macao lawyer arising from certain conduct in relation to recent U.S. proceedings was submitted to the Macao Lawyer's Association on October 19, 2015. A letter dated February 26, 2016, has been received from the Conselho Superior de Advocacia of the Macao Bar Association advising that disciplinary proceedings have commenced. A further letter dated April 5, 2016, was received from the Conselho Superior de Advocacia requesting confirmation that the signatories of the complaint were acting within their corporate authority. By a letter dated April 14, 2016, such confirmation has been provided. On September 28, 2016, the Conselho Superior de Advocacia invited comments on the defense which had been lodged by AAEC's Macao lawyer. On July 9, 2014, the plaintiff filed yet another action in the U.S. District Court against LVSC, LVSLLC, VCR (collectively, the "LVSC entities"), Sheldon G. Adelson, William P. Weidner, David Friedman and Does 1-50 for declaratory judgment, equitable accounting, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of confidence and conversion based on a theory of copyright law. The claim is for   $5.0 billion  . On November 4, 2014, plaintiff finally effected notice on the LVSC entities which was followed by a motion to dismiss by the LVSC entities on November 10, 2014. Plaintiff failed to timely respond and on December 2, 2014, the LVSC entities moved for immediate dismissal and sanctions against plaintiff and his counsel for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. On December 19, 2014, plaintiff filed an incomplete and untimely response, which was followed by plaintiff's December 27, 2014 notice of withdrawal of the lawsuit and the LVSC entities' December 29, 2014, reply in favor of sanctions and dismissal with prejudice. On August 31, 2015, the judge dismissed the U.S. action and the LVSC entities' sanctions motion. The Macao action is in a preliminary stage and management has determined that based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
  As previously disclosed by the Company, on February 5, 2007, AAEC brought a similar claim (the  Prior Action ) in the U.S. District Court, against LVSI (now known as LVSLLC), VCR and Venetian Venture Development, LLC, which are subsidiaries of the Company, and William P. Weidner and David Friedman, who are former executives of the Company. The U.S. District Court entered an order on April 16, 2010, dismissing the Prior Action. On April 20,

2012, LVSLLC, VCR and LVS (Nevada) filed an injunctive action (the  Nevada Action ) against AAEC in the U.S. District Court seeking to enjoin AAEC from proceeding with the Macao Action based on AAEC s filing, and the U.S. District Court s dismissal, of the Prior Action. On June 14, 2012, the U.S. District Court issued an order that denied the motions requesting the Nevada Action, thereby effectively dismissing the Nevada Action. 
  On February 11, 2014, the Company disclosed that it was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack on its computer networks in the United States. As a result of this criminal attack, the U.S. government has commenced investigations into the source of the attack. In addition, the Company is working with internal and external forensic information technology systems experts in connection with this effort. As a result of the investigations and the Company s efforts, which are ongoing, the Company has learned that certain customer and employee data was compromised at its Bethlehem facility and other data may have been stolen in the attack as well as that the attack may have destroyed certain other Company data. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigations. Based on the information available to date and the absence of claims asserted thus far, management is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of any matters relating to the cyber-attack, the extent of materiality or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. 
   
  NOTE 10   SEGMENT INFORMATION

  ITEM 2     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q. Certain statements in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  are forward-looking statements. See   Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  
   
  Operations 
  We view each of our casino properties as an operating segment. Our operating segments in the Macao Special Administrative Region ( Macao ) of the People s Republic of China consist of The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel ( The Venetian Macao  Sands Cotai Central; The Parisian Macao, which opened on September 13, 2016; the Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Cotai Strip and the Plaza Casino (collectively, the  Four Seasons Macao  the Sands Macao; and various other operations that are ancillary to our properties in that region ( Ferry Operations and Other ). Our operating segment in Singapore is the Marina Bay Sands. Our operating segments in the United States consist of The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino ( The Venetian Las Vegas ), The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino ( The Palazzo ) and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem (the  Sands Bethlehem ). The Venetian Las Vegas and The Palazzo operating segments are managed as a single integrated resort and have been aggregated into one reportable segment (the  Las Vegas Operating Properties ), considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products, the regulatory business environment of the operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gross revenue at our reportable segments was derived as follows: 
             
    At The Venetian Macao, approximately   82.3%   and   81.3%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived from mall, room, food and beverage and other non-gaming sources. 
                
    At Sands Cotai Central, approximately   79.2%   and   80.9%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived from room, food and beverage, mall and other non-gaming sources. 
                
    At The Parisian Macao, for the 18-day period ended September 30, 2016, approximately   78.7%   was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived primarily from room, mall and food and beverage operations. 
                
    At Four Seasons Macao, approximately   69.7%   and   74.1%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived primarily from mall, room and food and beverage operations. 
                
    At Sands Macao, approximately   92.6%   and   92.9%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived primarily from room and food and beverage operations. 
                
    At Marina Bay Sands, approximately   72.1%   and   74.7%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived from room, food and beverage, mall and other non-gaming sources. 
                
    At our Las Vegas Operating Properties, approximately   74.4%   and   72.3%  , respectively, was derived from room, food and beverage and other non-gaming sources, with the remainder derived from gaming activities. The percentage of non-gaming revenue reflects the integrated resort s emphasis on the group convention and trade show business. 
                
    At Sands Bethlehem, approximately   88.6%   and   88.5%  , respectively, was derived from gaming activities, with the remainder derived primarily from food and beverage and other non-gaming sources. 
      
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

believe these critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  presented in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016. 
  There were no newly identified significant accounting estimates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , nor were there any material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our   2015   Annual Report.

  Summary Financial Results 
  The following table summarizes our results of operations: 

Operating Results 
  Key Operating Revenue Measurements 
  Operating revenues at The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, The Parisian Macao, Four Seasons Macao, Marina Bay Sands and our Las Vegas Operating Properties are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. Operating revenues at Sands Macao and Sands Bethlehem are principally driven by casino customers who visit the properties on a daily basis. 
  The following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues: 
  Casino revenue measurements for Macao and Singapore:   Macao and Singapore table games are segregated into two groups, consistent with the Macao and Singapore markets  convention: Rolling Chip play (all VIP players) and Non-Rolling Chip play (mostly non-VIP players). The volume measurement for Rolling Chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. The volume measurement for Non-Rolling Chip play is table games drop ( drop ), which is the sum of markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop box and gaming chips purchased at the cage. Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip volume measurements are not comparable as the amounts wagered  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

and lost are substantially higher than the amounts dropped. Slot handle ( handle ), also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.  
  We view Rolling Chip win as a percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle. Win or hold percentage represents the percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. Based upon our mix of table games, our Rolling Chip win percentage (calculated before discounts and commissions) is expected to be within a range of 2.7% to 3.0% and our Non-Rolling Chip table games have produced a trailing 12-month win percentage (calculated before discounts) of   24.7%  ,   20.7%  ,   22.5%  ,   17.9%   and   28.6%   at The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Our slot machines have produced a trailing 12-month hold percentage (calculated before slot club cash incentives) of   4.6%  ,   3.6%  ,   6.1%  ,   3.3%   and   4.4%   at The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Actual win may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages. Generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. In Macao and Singapore,   16.5%   and   27.2%  , respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Casino revenue measurements for the U.S.:   The volume measurements in the U.S. are slot handle, as previously described, and table games drop which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in the table drop box. We view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of handle. Based upon our mix of table games, our table games are expected to produce a win percentage (calculated before discounts) within a range of 21% to 29% for Baccarat and 16% to 20% for non-Baccarat. Table games at Sands Bethlehem have produced a trailing 12-month win percentage of   19.1%  . Our slot machines have produced a trailing 12-month hold percentage (calculated before slot club cash incentives) of   8.0%   and   6.9%   at our Las Vegas Operating Properties and at Sands Bethlehem, respectively. Actual win may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages. As in Macao and Singapore, slot machine play is generally conducted on a cash basis. Approximately   59.3%   of our table games play at our Las Vegas Operating Properties, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was conducted on a credit basis, while our table games play in Pennsylvania is primarily conducted on a cash basis. 
  Hotel revenue measurements:   Performance indicators used are occupancy rate, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, and average daily room rate, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. The calculations of the hotel occupancy and average daily room rates include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. Complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail (or cash) room rates by customer segment and type of room product to ensure the complimentary room rates are consistent with retail rates. Revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy. Because not all available rooms are occupied, average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room. Reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re-sold to walk-in guests. These rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk-in guest revenue. In cases where a significant number of rooms are resold, occupancy rates may be in excess of 100% and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate. 
  Mall revenue measurements:   Occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. Occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area ( GLOA ) divided by gross leasable area ( GLA ) at the end of the reporting period. GLOA is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. GLA does not include space that is currently under development or not on the market for lease. Base rent per square foot is the annualized base, or minimum, rent charge in effect at the end of the reporting period, which is calculated on a weighted average basis, for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. Only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Operating Revenues 
  Our net revenues consisted of the following: 

Consolidated net revenues were   $2.97 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $74.9 million   compared to   $2.89 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was driven by $68.6 million of net revenues at The Parisian Macao, which opened in September 2016, and an $11.9 million increase at Marina Bay Sands. 
  Casino revenues increased $64.0 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to a $79.8 million increase at The Venetian Macao, driven by increases in Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip win percentages, as well as $58.1 million of revenues attributable to The Parisian Macao, partially offset by decreases of $38.4 million at Sands Macao, driven by decreases in Rolling Chip volume and win percentage, and $31.9 million at Sands Cotai Central, driven by a decrease in Rolling Chip volume. The following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:

Room revenues increased $22.5 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to increases of $11.4 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties and $10.3 million at Marina Bay Sands, driven by increased average daily room rates, and $5.8 million of revenues attributable to The Parisian Macao, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease at The Venetian Macao, driven by decreased average daily room rates. The suites at Sands Macao are primarily provided to casino patrons on a complimentary basis. The following table summarizes the results of our room activity:

Food and beverage revenues decreased $4.7 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to an $11.3 million decrease at our Las Vegas Operating Properties, driven by     a decrease in banquet operations, partially offset by $3.5 million of revenues attributable to The Parisian Macao, and a $3.0 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, primarily driven by the opening of new restaurants. 
  Mall revenues increased $6.8 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to $5.4 million of revenues at the Shoppes at Parisian.

Convention, retail and other revenues increased $11.2 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to increases of $5.7 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties and $3.5 million at Marina Bay Sands, driven by increases in our convention operations.  
  Operating Expenses 
  The breakdown of operating expenses is as follows: 

Operating expenses were   $2.25 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of $94.4 million compared to   $2.15 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a $76.2 million increase in pre-opening expenses related to the opening of The Parisian Macao and a $30.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Casino expenses decreased $52.4 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in junket commissions and the ongoing cost control and cost avoidance initiatives at our Macao operations, and a decrease in casino expenses at our Las Vegas Operating Properties and Marina Bay Sands. Our casino expenses also decreased in connection with the transition of certain personnel from our existing Macao operations to The Parisian Macao to focus on pre-opening activities in connection with its opening in September 2016. 
  The provision for doubtful accounts was   $51.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time. We believe that the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit. 
  General and administrative expenses increased $16.0 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an $8.1 million increase at our Las Vegas Operating Properties, driven by an increase in marketing and advertising efforts, and $6.5 million of expenses incurred at The Parisian Macao. 
  Pre-opening expense represents personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. Pre-opening expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily related to activities at The Parisian Macao, which opened in September 2016. Development expenses include the costs associated with the Company s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are also expensed as incurred. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased $30.1 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to an $18.5 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, driven by the acceleration of depreciation of certain assets due to room renovations, as well as $9.0 million attributable to The Parisian Macao.

  Consolidated Adjusted Property EBITDA 
  Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of its operations with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. The following table summarizes information related to our segments (see  Item 1   Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 10   Segment Information  for discussion of our operating segments and a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to net income): 

Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations increased $83.3 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $58.4 million increase at The Venetian Macao, driven by an increase in casino revenues, as well as $19.2 million in adjusted property EBITDA attributable to The Parisian Macao. 
  Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands increased $0.9 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net revenues increased $11.9 million, offset by increases in the associated operating expenses. 
  Adjusted property EBITDA at our Las Vegas Operating Properties increased $5.5 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in room revenues, partially offset by a decrease in food and beverage operations and an increase in marketing and advertising costs.  
  Adjusted property EBITDA at Sands Bethlehem increased $0.6 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net revenues increased $2.3 million, offset by increases in the associated operating expenses.

Interest Expense 
  The following table summarizes information related to interest expense: 

Interest cost increased $2.5 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting primarily from an increase in our weighted average debt balance. Capitalized interest increased $4.2 million compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the construction of The Parisian Macao. 
  Other Factors Effecting Earnings 
  Other income was   $21.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other income during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to $11.0 million of foreign currency transaction gains, driven by Singapore dollar denominated intercompany debt held in the U.S., and a $10.0 million fair value adjustment on our Singapore forward contracts. 
  Our effective income tax rate was 10.3% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to 10.5% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective income tax rates reflect a 17% statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations and a zero percent tax rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao, effective through the end of 2018. We have recorded a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets generated by operations in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions; however, to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes  more-likely-than-not  that these deferred tax assets, or a portion thereof, are realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowances in the period such determination is made as appropriate. 
  The net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests was   $92.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $98.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of Sands China Ltd. ("SCL").

The decrease in net revenues was driven by decreases of $362.8 million at our Macao operations and $172.1 million at Marina Bay Sands, primarily due to decreased casino revenues. 
  Casino revenues decreased $514.9 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to a $336.4 million decrease at our Macao operations, driven by a decrease in Rolling Chip volume, and a $181.2 million decrease at Marina Bay Sands, driven by decreases in Rolling Chip volume and win percentage, as well as a decrease in Non-Rolling Chip drop.

The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in casino expenses at our Macao operations.  
  Casino expenses decreased $369.6 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Of the decrease, $184.5 million was due to the 39.0% gross win tax on decreased casino revenues at our Macao operations, and a $64.5 million decrease in casino expenses associated with the decreased casino revenues at Marina Bay Sands. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in junket commissions, as well as the ongoing cost control and cost avoidance initiatives at our Macao operations.  
  Convention, retail and other expenses decreased $21.4 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $19.7 million decrease at The Venetian Macao, primarily driven by a decrease in entertainment. 
  The provision for doubtful accounts was   $138.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $126.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was primarily due to a $39.5 million decrease at our Macao operations, driven by a reduction in marketing and advertising efforts as a result of ongoing cost control initiatives. The decrease was partially offset by increases of $6.7 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties and $6.0 million at Marina Bay Sands. 
  Corporate expenses increased $80.8 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to nonrecurring legal costs.

Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations decreased $6.6 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As previously described, the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in casino operations, driven by decreased demand in the VIP market, partially offset by our ongoing cost control and cost avoidance initiatives.  
  Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands decreased $145.7 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

The increase in the effective income tax rate relates primarily to the valuation allowances recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as we determined that certain deferred tax assets were no longer  more-likely-than-not  realizable.

  Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations 
  We own and operate retail malls at our integrated resorts at The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, Four Seasons Macao, The Parisian Macao, Marina Bay Sands and Sands Bethlehem. Management believes that being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. 
  Our malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our integrated resorts. Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our customers and provide a wide variety of shopping options. We generate our mall revenues primarily from leases with tenants through minimum base rents, overage rents, and reimbursements for common area maintenance ( CAM ) and other expenditures.

              (4) 
    Commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in Cotai. Each property is also eligible to obtain an additional six-year exemption, provided certain qualifications are met. To date, The Venetian Macao and the Four Seasons Macao have obtained the second exemption, extending the property tax exemption to August 2019 and August 2020, respectively. 
              (5) 
    Mall-related expenses consist of CAM, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs. 
     It is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income ( NOI ) as a useful supplemental measure of a mall s operating performance. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
  In the tables above, we believe that taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. Other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. As such, this calculation may not be comparable to the NOI of other mall operating companies.

Development Projects 
  Macao 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have capitalized an aggregate of $12.19 billion in construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization) for our Cotai Strip developments, which include The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, The Parisian Macao and Four Seasons Macao, as well as our investments in transportation infrastructure, including our passenger ferry service operations.  
  Land concessions in Macao generally have an initial term of 25 years with automatic extensions of 10 years thereafter in accordance with Macao law. We have received land concessions from the Macao government to build on the sites on which The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, The Parisian Macao and Four Seasons Macao are located. We do not own these land sites in Macao; however, the land concessions grant us exclusive use of the land. As specified in the land concessions, we are required to pay premiums for each parcel, which are either payable in a single lump sum upon acceptance of the land concessions by the Macao government or in seven semi-annual installments, as well as annual rent for the term of the land concessions. 
  We are completing the development of certain open areas surrounding our Cotai Strip properties. Under our land concessions for Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao, we are required to complete these developments by December 2016 and January 2017 (which was extended by the Macao government from November 2016), respectively. Should we determine we are unable to complete Sands Cotai Central or The Parisian Macao by their respective deadlines, we would then expect to apply for another extension from the Macao government to the extent necessary. If we are unable to meet the current deadlines and the deadlines for either development are not extended, we could lose our land concessions for Sands Cotai Central or The Parisian Macao, which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under the respective land concessions. As a result, we could record a charge for all or some portion of our   $4.90 billion   or   $2.62 billion   in capitalized construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization), as of   September 30, 2016  , related to Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao, respectively. 
  United States 
  We were constructing the Las Vegas Condo Tower, located on the Las Vegas Strip between The Palazzo and The Venetian Las Vegas. We suspended our construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for Las Vegas Strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions. We are evaluating the highest return opportunity for the project and intend to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve. The impact of the suspension on the estimated overall cost of the project is currently not determinable with certainty. Should demand and conditions fail to improve or management decides to abandon the project, we could record a charge for some portion of the   $178.6 million   in capitalized construction costs as of   September 30, 2016  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flows   Summary 
  Our cash flows consisted of the following: 

Cash Flows   Operating Activities 
  Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. Net cash generated from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased $389.5 million compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to changes in our working capital accounts, consisting primarily of changes in accounts receivable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by the decrease in net income. 
  Cash Flows   Investing Activities 
  Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $1.10 billion  , including $970.7 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted primarily of $797.9 million for The Parisian Macao and $97.7 million for Sands Cotai Central; $56.8 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; and $50.0 million in Singapore. Additionally, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid   66.0 million   Singapore dollars ("SGD," approximately   $48.4 million   at exchange rates in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) to renew our Singapore gaming license for a three-year term. 
  Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , totaled   $1.11 billion  , including $938.4 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted primarily of $519.8 million for The Parisian Macao and $333.4 million for Sands Cotai Central; $96.7 million in Singapore; and $55.0 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties.  
  Cash Flows   Financing Activities 
  Net cash flows used in financing activities were   $2.08 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily attributable to $2.34 billion in dividend payments, partially offset by net proceeds of $297.3 million from our various credit facilities.

     Table of Contents  

Net cash flows used in financing activities were   $2.93 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily attributable to $2.17 billion in dividend payments and net repayments of $614.4 million on our various credit facilities. 
  Capital Financing Overview 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , we have funded our development projects primarily through borrowings under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, operating cash flows, proceeds from our equity offerings and proceeds from the disposition of non-core assets. 
  Our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities contain various financial covenants. The U.S. credit facility, as amended, requires our Las Vegas operations to comply with a financial covenant at the end of each quarter to the extent that any revolving loans or certain letters of credit are outstanding. This financial covenant requires our Las Vegas operations to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined ( Adjusted EBITDA ). The maximum leverage ratio is 5.5x for all quarterly periods through maturity. We can elect to contribute cash on hand to our Las Vegas operations on a bi-quarterly basis; such contributions having the effect of increasing Adjusted EBITDA during the applicable quarter for purposes of calculating compliance with the maximum leverage ratio. Our Macao credit facility requires our Macao operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA. The maximum leverage ratio is 4.0x for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2016 through March 31, 2017, and then decreases to, and remains at 3.5x for all quarterly periods thereafter through maturity. Our Singapore credit facility requires our Marina Bay Sands operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA. The maximum leverage ratio is 3.5x for the quarterly periods ending September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2019, and then decreases to, and remains at, 3.0x for all quarterly periods thereafter through maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , our U.S., Macao and Singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 0.7x, 2.0x and 2.5x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 5.5x, 4.0x and 3.5x, respectively. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities. A default under the U.S. credit facility would trigger a cross-default under our airplane financings. Any defaults or cross-defaults under these agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. If the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance any amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations. 
  We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $1.79 billion   and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $9.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which approximately   $1.22 billion   of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the   $1.22 billion  , approximately $980.5 million is available to be repatriated to the U.S. with minimal taxes owed on such amounts due to the significant foreign taxes we paid, which would ultimately generate U.S. foreign tax credits if cash is repatriated. The remaining unrestricted amounts are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third party public shareholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL. We believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $3.51 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, as of   September 30, 2016  , will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and opportunities for enhancements thereof. 
  In June 2016, we entered into an agreement to amend our 2011 VML Credit Facility, which became effective in August 2016. This agreement extended the maturity of a portion of the term loans under the facility to May 2022 and provides for additional term loan commitments of $1.0 billion (see "Item 1   Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 3   Long-Term Debt   2016 VML Credit Facility ). In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to amend our 2013 U.S. Credit Facility, which extended the maturity of a portion of the revolving credit commitments under the facility to September 2020 (see "Item 1   Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 3   Long-Term Debt  2013 U.S. Credit Facility). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net borrowings of $999.7 million on our Macao credit facilities and made net repayments of $630.0 million on our 2013 U.S. Revolving Facility.

On February 26 and June 24, 2016, SCL paid a dividend of   0.99   Hong Kong dollars ("HKD") and HKD   1.00   per share, respectively, to SCL shareholders (a total of   $2.07 billion  , of which we retained   $1.45 billion   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ). On March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2016, we paid a dividend of   $0.72   per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and recorded   $1.72 billion   as a distribution against retained earnings (of which   $932.6 million   related to our Principal Stockholder s family and the remaining   $784.2 million   related to all other shareholders) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In November 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.72   per common share (a total estimated to be approximately   $572 million  ) to be paid on December 30, 2016, to shareholders of record on December 21, 2016. In November 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors increased the dividend for the 2017 calendar year to $2.92 per common share, or $0.73 per common share per quarter. 
  In October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of   $2.0 billion   of our outstanding common stock, which expired in October 2016. In November 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of   $1.56 billion   of our outstanding common stock, which expires in   November 2018  . Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   share repurchases under this program. All share repurchases of our common stock are recorded as treasury stock. 
  Aggregate Indebtedness and Other Known Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there had been no material changes to our aggregated indebtedness and other known contractual obligations, which are set forth in the table included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , with the exception of the following: 
             
    amendment and extension of our 2011 VML Credit Facility, which included additional term loan proceeds of $1.0 billion (see "Item 1   Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 3   Long-Term Debt   2016 VML Credit Facility  and 
      Restrictions on Distributions 
  We are a parent company with limited business operations. Our main asset is the stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. The debt instruments of our U.S., Macao and Singapore subsidiaries contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or equity interests, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase equity interests or certain indebtedness, create certain liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain mergers or consolidations or sell our assets of our company without prior approval of the lenders or noteholders.

  ITEM 3     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our operations outside the United States, which we may manage through the use of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps, forward contracts and similar instruments. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. Our derivative financial instruments currently consist exclusively of foreign currency forward contracts, none of which have been designated as hedging instruments. 
  To manage exposure to foreign currency forward contracts, we enter into agreements with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. Frequently, these institutions are also members of the bank group providing our credit facilities, which management believes further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. 
  The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Weighted average variable rates are based on   September 30, 2016  , LIBOR, HIBOR and SOR plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company s reporting currency, for the twelve months ending   September 30  : 

_______________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs (quoted prices in markets that are not active). 
              (2) 
    Based upon contractual interest rates for current LIBOR, HIBOR and SOR for variable-rate indebtedness. Based on variable rate debt levels as of   September 30, 2016  , an assumed 100 basis point change in LIBOR, HIBOR and SOR would cause our annual interest cost to change by approximately $99.0 million. 
     
   53 

     Table of Contents  

Foreign currency transaction losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were $15.5 million primarily due to Singapore dollar denominated intercompany debt held in the U.S., partially offset by U.S. dollar denominated debt held in Macao. We may be vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar/SGD and U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rates. Based on balances as of   September 30, 2016  , an assumed 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the SGD would cause a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $70.3 million or a loss of approximately $85.1 million, and an assumed 1% change in the U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of approximately $17.2 million. We maintain a significant amount of our operating funds in the same currencies in which we have obligations, thereby reducing our exposure to currency fluctuations. Additionally, we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations with foreign currency forward contracts. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   20   foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional value of   $497.6 million   and a total liability fair value of   $15.4 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , an unfavorable 10% change in the U.S. dollar/SGD exchange rate would have increased our unrealized loss by approximately $49.9 million.

  ITEM 4       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  , and have concluded that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The only change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that had, or was reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company s internal control over financial reporting was the opening of The Parisian Macao in September 2016. The Company has implemented controls and procedures at The Parisian Macao similar to those in effect at the Company's other properties.

(iv)          any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall, subject to subsection 2.2B(v), end on the last Business Day of a calendar month; 

(v)           no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Loans shall extend beyond the Maturity Date for such Loans;

Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 

F.              Computation of Interest  . Interest on the Loans shall be computed on the basis of (i) a 360-day year, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (ii) a 365-day year, in respect of Base Rate Loans and HIBOR Rate Loans, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues.

Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied (1) as specified by the Borrower with respect to Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans in the applicable notice of prepayment and (2) on a pro rata basis (in accordance with subsection 2.4B(iv)(c)) with respect to Term Loans or, at the option of the Borrower, applied to the Non-Extended Initial Term Loans on a pro rata basis (in accordance with subsection 2.4B(iv)(c));   provided   that in the event the Borrower fails to specify the Loans to which any such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied   first   to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans and Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof on a pro rata basis and   second   to repay outstanding Term Loans on a pro rata basis (in accordance with subsection 2.4B(iv)(c)). 

(b)              Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of Loans  . Any amount (the   Applied Amount  ) required to be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to subsections 2.4B(iii)(a)-(e) or (h) shall be applied to   first   prepay the Term Loans on a pro rata basis to the full extent thereof,   provided   that, until the date that is 270 calendar days after the 2016 Restatement Date and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may elect to apply such prepayments first to prepay the Non-Extended Initial Term Loans on a pro rata basis before prepaying the Extended Initial Term Loans or the New Initial Term Loans, and   second  , to the extent of  

84 

any remaining portion of the Applied Amount, to prepay the Revolving Loans pro rata to the full extent thereof (without any reduction of Revolving Loan Commitments).

(c)              Application of Prepayments of Term Loans to the Scheduled Installments of Principal Thereof  . Any prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) or 2.4B(iii)(a)-(e) or (h) shall be applied to the scheduled installments thereof (including the final principal payment on the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date) on a pro rata basis. 

(d)            [Reserved]. 

(e)              Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Rate Loans and HIBOR Rate Loans  . Considering Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.6D. 

C.              General Provisions Regarding Payments  . 

(i)              Manner and Time of Payment  . All payments by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder and under the Notes shall be made in Dollars, Patacas or HK Dollars, based on each Lender s Percentage of outstanding Term Loans and Revolving Loans in each such currency (or, with respect to commitment fees under subsection 2.3A, each Lender s Percentage of the Commitments under the applicable Facility in the currency of such Commitments), in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00a.m. (Macau SAR time) on the date due (or, if necessary, on the next preceding Business Day) at the applicable Payment and Funding Office for the account of Lenders; for purposes of computing interest and fees, funds received by the Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by the Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge its accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause timely payment to be made to the Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that purpose). 

(ii)             Application of Payments to Principal and Interest  . All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal. 

(iii)            Apportionment of Payments  . Aggregate principal and interest payments in respect of Loans shall be apportioned among all outstanding Loans proportionately to the Lenders  respective Pro Rata Shares (subject to subsection 2.12). The Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its primary address set forth on   Schedule 2.1   or at such other address as such Lender may request in writing, its Pro Rata Share of all such payments received by the Administrative Agent, and the  

85 

commitment fees of such Lender and all other amounts due to such Lender, when received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3 (subject to subsection 2.12). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Conversion/Continuation Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or Market Disruption Lender or if any Affected Lender or Market Disruption Lender makes Base Rate Loans or Alternate HK Dollar Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter.

(iv)            Payments on Business Days  . Subject to the provisos set forth in the definition of  Interest Period  as they may apply to Revolving Loans, whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to Revolving Loans only, such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be. 

(v)             Notation of Payment  . Each Lender agrees that before disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by granting participations therein), that Lender will make a notation thereon of all Loans evidenced by that Note and all principal payments previously made thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has been paid;   provided   that the failure to make (or any error in the making of) a notation of any Loan made under such Note shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under such Note with respect to any Loan or any payments of principal or interest on such Note. 

2.5             Use of Proceeds.  

A.              Revolving Loans  . The proceeds of the 2014 Restatement Date Revolving Loans, including any Swing Line Loans,   shall be applied by the Borrower (i) to fund the ongoing development of the VOL Casino Hotel Resort Project, (ii) to fund the development on Site 3 and (iii) for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Loan Parties, including to make any investment or payment not specifically prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents and to pay the Transaction Costs.

(a) The proceeds of the Existing Term Loans were applied by the Borrower in accordance with the 2014 Credit Agreement and (b) the proceeds of the New Initial Term Loans shall be applied by the Borrower for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Loan Parties including to make any investment or payment not otherwise specifically prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents.

D.              Margin Regulations  . No portion of the proceeds of any borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates in any manner that would cause the borrowing or the application of such proceeds to violate  

86 

Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

E.              Sanctions  . No portion of the proceeds of any borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the actual knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their Affiliates) for business activities relating to Cuba, Sudan, Iran, Myanmar (Burma), Syria, North Korea or Libya. No portion of the proceeds of any borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the actual knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their Affiliates) for business activities that are prohibited by sanctions, restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United Nations, the European Union, the United States Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, HM Treasury of the United Kingdom, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia and/or the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Furthermore, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue a Letter of Credit where the beneficiary thereof is a Restricted Party or has direct or indirect activities with a Restricted Party. 

2.6             Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans and HIBOR Rate Loans.  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans as to the matters covered:

A.              Determination of Applicable Interest Rate  . As soon as practicable after 1:00p.m. (Macau SAR time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and each Lender. 

B.              Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate  . In the event that the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar or HK Dollar market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate or HIBOR Rate, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans, as the case may be, until such time as Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise  

87 

to such notice no longer exist and (ii) any Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by the Borrower with respect to the Loans denominated in Dollars in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be made with respect to Base Rate Loans.

C.              Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans  . In the event that it becomes unlawful for a Lender to make, maintain or continue its Commitments or Loans, as contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Change in Law (or would conflict with any treaty, order, policy, rule or regulation (including any regulation set forth by the Nevada Gaming Authority or any other gaming authority with jurisdiction over the gaming business of the Company) having the force of law), then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an   Affected Lender   and it shall promptly give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (i) if the same is unlawful for such Affected Lender, the obligation of such Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans, HIBOR Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender (which such Affected Lender shall do at the earliest practicable date), (ii) if it becomes unlawful for such Affected Lender to maintain its outstanding Loans, such Affected Lender s obligation to maintain its outstanding Loans (the   Affected Loans  ) shall, subject to subsection 2.8A, be terminated, its Commitments shall be terminated and its RL Percentage and/or TL Percentage, as applicable, shall be reduced to zero, in each case, at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by law), whereupon such Affected Lender shall receive a prepayment in the amount of its outstanding Loans and cease to be a Lender under this Agreement, and (iii) the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent such additional amounts of cash as reasonably requested by any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender to be held as security for the Borrower s reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans then outstanding (such amount not to exceed such Affected Lender s obligations under subsection 2.10D, subsection 3.1C or subsection 3.3C). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

D.              Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods  . The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by that Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by that Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by that Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds) which that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by that Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or HIBOR Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Borrowing Notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, as applicable, or a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or HIBOR Rate Loan does not occur as a result of the revocation by the Borrower of the related Borrowing Notice pursuant to subsection 2.6F, or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or HIBOR Rate Loan does not occur  

88 

on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment (including any prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) and subsection 2.4B(iii)) or other principal payment (including pursuant to an assignment of Revolving Loans on any Increased Amount Date pursuant to Section 2.12) or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower, or (iv) as a consequence of any other default by the Borrower in the repayment of its Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement. If at any time any prepayment is required that would give rise to any compensation pursuant to this subsection 2.6D under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, and no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then at the Borrower s option upon five Business Days  notice to the Administrative Agent, the applicable prepayment amount may be deposited irrevocably into the Prepayment Account in lieu of payment to the applicable Lenders. Such funds shall be held in the Prepayment Account until the last day of the applicable Interest Period, at which time the amount deposited in the Prepayment Account shall be further disbursed to the applicable Lenders. The deposit of amounts into the Prepayment Account shall not constitute a prepayment of principal and all principal to be prepaid using the proceeds from such account shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable interest rate until actually prepaid.

E.              Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans  . Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender,   provided   that as of the date of any such change in any Lender s booking office for its Commitments or Loans hereunder or the effective date of any such assignment to an Affiliate of such Lender, such Lender or Affiliate is not entitled to claim an amount in excess of that which would have been payable to or for the account of original branch of such Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, in respect of Included Taxes pursuant to subsection 2.7C(i) (but without prejudice to any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect to such Included Taxes occurring after the date of such change or assignment). 

F.              Market Disruption  . If within one Business Day after the Interest Rate Determination Date for any Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans the Administrative Agent receives notifications from any Lender, or Lenders, holding more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Loans (any such Lender or Lenders,   Market Disruption Lenders  ) that the cost to it or them of obtaining matching deposits in the London interbank market or the Hong Kong interbank market, respectively, would be in excess of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate or the HIBOR Rate, as the case may be (a   Market Disruption Event  ), then, the rate of interest for such Loans for such Interest Period shall be calculated in the manner set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of the next sentence. Upon receipt of notification from the Market Disruption Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower in writing (which notice shall identify the Market Disruption Lenders) of the occurrence of such Market Disruption Event, and thereafter the Borrower may by telephonic notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time prior to the Business Day next preceding the date of such Borrowing or the first day of such Interest Period, as the case may be, revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or  

89 

HIBOR Rate Loans, as applicable, or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of (1) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, Base Rate Loans and (2) in the case of Loans denominated in HK Dollars or Patacas, Loans at the HIBOR Rate determined as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by Reference Banks in accordance with clause (b) in the definition of HIBOR Rate (or if the HIBOR Rate which gave rise to the Market Disruption Event was already determined in such manner, at the Alternate HK Dollar Rate) in the amount specified therein. If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Administrative Agent or the Borrower so requires, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing as substitute basis for determining the rate of interest for Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans, as the case may be). Any alternative basis so agreed between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, with the prior consent of all Lenders and the Borrower, be binding on all parties hereto.

G.              Eurodollar Rate Loans and HIBOR Rate Loans After Default  . After the occurrence of and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default, (i) if so notified by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may not elect to have a Loan be made or maintained as, or converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a HIBOR Rate Loan (  provided   that, if such notice has been given by the Administrative Agent, such HIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Alternate HK Dollar Rate), after the expiration of any Interest Period then in effect for that Loan and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, any Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by the Borrower with respect to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation that has not yet occurred shall be deemed made with respect to Base Rate Loans. 

2.7             Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Taxes.  

A.              Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes  . Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7C (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any Change in Law: 

(i)            subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office or (as the case may be) any of its direct or indirect parents) to any additional Tax (other than any (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 

(ii)            imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender or (as the case may be) any of its direct or indirect parents (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate or HIBOR Rate, respectively); or 

90 

(iii)            imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the interbank Eurodollar or HK Dollar market; 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or (as the case may be) any of its direct or indirect parents of agreeing to make, making or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or HIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office or (as the case may be) any of its direct or indirect parents) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this subsection 2.7A, which statement shall be prima facie evidence of the matters set forth therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender pursuant to this subsection 2.7A for any Taxes, costs or reduced amounts incurred more than twelve (12) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the circumstances giving rise to such Taxes or increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable by such Lender and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstances giving rise to such Taxes, increased costs or reductions are retroactive in effect, then the twelve-month period referred to above shall (if the period of retroactive effect includes any period prior to the first day of such twelve month period) be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

B.              Capital Adequacy Adjustment  . If any Lender (which term shall include the Issuing Lender for purposes of this subsection 2.7B) shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender s Loans or Commitments or participations in Letters of Credit or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender, or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by the Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or (as the case may be) or such controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error;   provided   that (A) the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this subsection 2.7B for any amount incurred more than 270 days prior to the date of the written demand therefor, and (B) the limitation in (A) shall not apply to any claim arising out of the retroactive application of any Change in Law giving rise to such loss, expense or liability. 

91 

C.              Taxes; Withholding; Etc  . 

(i)              Payments to Be Free and Clear  . All sums payable by or on account of any  obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to any Agent or any Lender shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax (other than an Excluded Tax) imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within (a) the United States or any political subdivision in or of the United States or (b) Macau SAR or any political subdivision in or of Macau SAR or (c) any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made or deemed made by or on behalf of the Borrower or by any federation or organization of which the United States or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment, all such non-excluded Taxes being hereinafter collectively referred to as   Included Taxes  . 

(ii)             Withholding of Taxes  . If the Borrower or any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Included Tax from any sum paid or payable by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Loan Documents (each, as applicable, a   Withholding Agent  ), then: 

(a)           the applicable Withholding Agent or the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding; 

(b)           the applicable Withholding Agent or the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Instrumentality in accordance with the applicable law; and 

(c)           the sum payable by the applicable Withholding Agent shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment (including any deduction, withholding or payment on amounts paid pursuant to this subsection 2.7C(ii)), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made. 

(iii)            Evidence of Payments  . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Instrumentality pursuant to subsection 2.7C, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority. 

(iv)            Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower  . The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Instrumentality in accordance with the applicable law any Other Taxes. 

(v)             Indemnification by the Borrower  . The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this subsection 2.7C), and  

92 

any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Instrumentality. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(vi)            Indemnification by the Lenders  . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.1, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable and paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonably expenses arising therefore or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Instrumentality. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. 

(vii)           Status of Lenders  . Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any Included Taxes imposed on payments made pursuant to the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower, promptly upon request to such Lender by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation provided by the Borrower and prescribed by applicable law and such other information reasonably requested that is necessary to reduce or eliminate such Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be obligated to provide any documentation pursuant to this subsection 2.7C(vii) if such Lender is not legally able to do so. 

(a)            If a payment made to any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this subsection 2.7C(vii)(a),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(viii)          Treatment of Certain Refunds  . If a Lender or the Administrative Agent receives or anticipates, in its sole discretion, that it will ultimately receive or otherwise benefit from a refund that it determines, in its sole discretion, is in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7C(ii), it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over the amount of such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this subsection 2.7C with respect to Taxes giving rise to such refund) net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such refund);   provided   that the Borrower, upon request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalty, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection 2.7C, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection 2.7C(viii), the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Taxes subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Taxes had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 

(ix)             Survival  . Each party s obligations under this subsection 2.7C shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

(x)            For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the 2016 Restatement Date, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Loans as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). 

2.8             Obligation of Lenders to Mitigate; Replacement of Lenders.  

A.            Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender responsible for administering the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender or Issuing Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 it will, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund or maintain the Commitments of such Lender or Issuing Lender or the affected Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letters of credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender or  

94 

(ii) take such other measures as such Lender or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender or Issuing Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit through such other lending or Letters of Credit office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect, in any material respect, such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit or the interests of such Lender or Issuing Lender;   provided   that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be obligated to utilize such other lending or Letters of Credit office pursuant to this subsection 2.8A if such Lender or Issuing Lender would incur incremental expenses as a result of utilizing such other lending office as described in clause (i) above unless the Loan Parties agree in writing to pay all such incidental costs on or prior to the date such costs would be incurred by such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.8A (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender or Issuing Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that it will not request compensation under subsection 2.7 unless such request would be consistent with such Lender s or Issuing Lender s general practice in such regard at such time.

B.            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender becomes (x) an Affected Lender, (y) a Market Disruption Lender or (z) entitled to receive any additional amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7A, 2.7B, or 2.7C(ii), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in subsection 10.1, including as a condition precedent to such assignment, (i) Administrative Agent s consent to the assignee unless not otherwise required by subsection 10.1 and (ii) payment by the Borrower of the registration fee set forth in subsection 10.1B(i), if applicable), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment, or an Affiliate of the Company to the extent such Affiliate is permitted as an Eligible Assignee);   provided   that (i) such Lender shall have received irrevocable payment in full in cash of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, and accrued fees and all other Obligations and other amounts payable to it hereunder (including amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.6D) from the assignee or the Borrower (or such lesser amount agreed to by the parties) and (ii) such assignee would, immediately after such assignment, not be entitled to receive any additional amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7C(ii) hereof (or, alternatively, would be entitled to receive reduced additional amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7C(ii) hereof than such assignor would have received but for such assignment). 

2.9             Incremental Facilities.  

A.            The Borrower may by written notice to the Co-Syndication Agents and the Administrative Agent elect to request from time to time (i) prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, an increase to the existing Revolving Loan Commitments (any such increase, the   New Revolving Loan Commitments  ) and/or (ii) the establishment of one  

95 

or more new term loan commitments (the   New Term Loan Commitments  ), denominated in Dollars, HK Dollars and/or Patacas pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in an amount, together with the aggregate principal amount of all Permitted Bonds outstanding pursuant to subsection 7.1(xx), not in excess of the sum of (x) $2,000,000,000 in the aggregate minus the aggregate principal amount of the New Initial Term Loans funded on the 2016 Restatement Date plus (y) the amount of any New Term Loan Commitments the net cash proceeds of which are used solely to repay in whole or in part any Term Loans and, in each case, not less than $25,000,000 individually (and/or the equivalent thereof in HK Dollars and/or Patacas) (or such lesser amount which shall be approved by the Administrative Agent), which amount set forth in such notice may be a proposed range of new commitments that otherwise comply with the foregoing requirements. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an   Increased Amount Date  ) on which the Borrower proposes that the New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments, as the case may be, shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days (or such shorter time as is agreed upon by the Administrative Agent) after the date on which such notice is delivered to each Co-Syndication Agent and the Administrative Agent. When available, the Administrative Agent will deliver a notice to the Borrower and each Lender setting forth the identity of each Lender or other Person that is an Eligible Assignee or any other Person (other than a natural Person) approved by the Borrower (each, a   New Term Loan Lender   or a   New Revolving Loan Lender  , as applicable) to which the Administrative Agent has allocated any portion of such New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments and the amounts of such allocations, and in the case of each notice to any Revolving Loan Lender, the respective interests in such Revolving Loan Lender s Revolving Loans, in each case subject to the assignments contemplated by this Section;   provided   that any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a New Revolving Loan Commitment or New Term Loan Commitment.

B.            Such New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date;   provided   that (1) no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments and the related Credit Extensions; (2) both before and after giving effect to the effectiveness of any Series of New Term Loan Commitments or New Revolving Loan Commitments, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio shall not be greater than 3.5:1.0; (3) both before and after giving effect to the making of any Series of New Term Loans, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 shall be satisfied; (4) the Borrower shall be in pro forma compliance with each of the covenants set forth in Section 7.6 as of the last day of the most recently ended Fiscal Quarter after giving effect to such New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments; (5) the New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and each of which shall be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection 2.7C(vii); (6) the Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to subsection 2.6D in connection with the New Revolving Loan Commitments or New Term Loan Commitments; and (7) the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction. Any New Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated a separate series (a   Series  ) of New Term  

96 

Loans for all purposes of this Agreement (all New Term Loans or New Term Loan Commitments of any Series, a   New Term Loan Facility  ).

C.            On any Increased Amount Date on which New Revolving Loan Commitments are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (a) each of the Revolving Loan Lenders shall assign to each of the New Revolving Loan Lenders, and each of the New Revolving Loan Lenders shall purchase from each of the Revolving Loan Lenders, at the principal amount thereof (together with accrued interest), such interests in the Revolving Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans will be held by existing Revolving Loan Lenders and New Revolving Loan Lenders ratably in accordance with their Revolving Loan Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such New Revolving Loan Commitments to the Revolving Loan Commitments, (b) each New Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Loan Commitment and each Loan made thereunder (a   New Revolving Loan  ) shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Loan and (c) each New Revolving Loan Lender shall become a Lender with respect to the New Revolving Loan Commitment and all matters relating thereto. 

D.            On any Increased Amount Date on which any New Term Loan Commitments of any Series are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each New Term Loan Lender of such Series shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a   New Term Loan  ) in an amount equal to its New Term Loan Commitment of such Series, and (ii) each New Term Loan Lender of such Series shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New Term Loan Commitment of such Series and the New Term Loans of such Series made pursuant thereto. Proceeds of any Series of New Term Loans shall be deposited in an account designated by the Borrower. 

E.            The terms and provisions of the New Term Loans and New Term Loan Commitments of any Series shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein or in the applicable Joinder Agreement, identical to the Extended Initial Term Loans and the New Initial Term Loans. The terms and provisions of the New Revolving Loans and New Revolving Loan Commitments shall be identical to the Revolving Credit Facility (except that customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to one or more arrangers (or their affiliates) of the New Revolving Loan Commitments may be different than those paid with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility). In any event (i) the weighted average life to maturity of all New Term Loans of any Series shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Extended Initial Term Loans and the New Initial Term Loans, (ii) the applicable New Term Loan Maturity Date of each Series shall be no earlier than the final maturity of the Term Loans, (iii) the rate of interest and any applicable original issue discount applicable to the New Term Loans of each Series shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders and shall be set forth in each applicable Joinder Agreement. Each Joinder Agreement   may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Co-Syndication Agents and the Administrative Agent, to effect the provision of this subsection 2.9. 

2.10             Swing Line Loans.  

97 

A.            Swing Line Loans shall be made in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. 

B.            Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Notice no later than 11:00 a.m. (Macau SAR time) one Business Day prior to the proposed Funding Date. 

C.            The Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than 3:00p.m. (Macau SAR time) on the applicable Funding Date by wire transfer (together with the applicable SWIFT confirmation) of same day funds in Dollars, Patacas or HK Dollars, as the case may be, where and as directed by the Borrower. Except as provided herein, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in subsection 4.2, the Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swing Line Loans available to the Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars, Patacas or HK Dollars, as the case may be, equal to the proceeds of all such Swing Line Loans received by the Administrative Agent from the Swing Line Lender to be credited to the account of the Borrower at the Payment and Funding Office, or such other office of the Administrative Agent as may be designated in writing to the Borrower in the case of Swing Line Loans denominated in Patacas or HK Dollars. 

D.            With respect to any outstanding Swing Line Loans, if (i) such Swing Line Loans shall be outstanding for more than four Business Days, (ii) any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall occur and be continuing on a date such Swing Line Loans are outstanding, or (iii) the Swing Line Lender delivers to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Borrower), no later than 11:00a.m. (Macau SAR time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date, a notice (which shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Notice given by Borrower) requesting that each Lender holding a Revolving Loan Commitment make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to the Borrower on such Funding Date in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Swing Line Loans (in each case, the   Refunded Swing Line Loans  ), then (x) in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to have delivered a Borrowing Notice in accordance with clause (iii) and (y) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Revolving Loan Lender of the amount requested, each Revolving Loan Lender shall deposit in an account specified by the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share of the amount so requested in same day funds and such funds shall be applied by the Swing Line Lender to repay the Refunded Swing Line Loans. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Lenders other than the Swing Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender (and not to the Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (2) on the day such Revolving Loans are made, the Swing Line Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Swing Line Lender to the Borrower in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent of such Pro Rata Share, and such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due under the Swing Line Note of the Swing Line Lender but shall instead constitute part of the Swing Line Lender s outstanding Revolving Loans to the Borrower and shall be due under the Revolving Loan Note issued by the Borrower to the Swing Line Lender. The  

98 

Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender to charge the Borrower s accounts with the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay the Swing Line Lender the amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by Lenders holding Revolving Loan Commitments, including the Revolving Loans deemed to be made by the Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to the Swing Line Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the Swing Line Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (1) each Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including without limitation (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Loan Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuation of a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default; (C) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party; (D) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; and (2) the Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loans (A) if it has elected not to do so after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default or (B) at a time when any Lender is a Defaulting Lender unless the Swing Line Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lender s risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender s participation in such Swing Line Loan, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing Line Loans.

2.11              Refinancing Amendments.   The Borrower may obtain, from any Lender or any Affiliates thereof or any other Person (other than a natural Person), Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of all or any portion of the Loans or Commitments then outstanding under this Agreement (which for purposes of this subsection 2.11 will be deemed to include any then outstanding New Term Loans, New Term Loan Commitments, New Revolving Loans, New Revolving Loan Commitments, Other Loans or Other Commitments), in the form of Other Loans or Other Commitments in each case pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment. Any Other Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments hereunder, as specified in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, and such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness may have such pricing and optional prepayment terms as may be agreed by the Borrower and the lenders thereof. The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in subsection 4.2 and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of customary legal opinions, board resolutions, officers  certificates and/or reaffirmation agreements generally consistent with those delivered on the 2016 Restatement Date under subsection 7 of the 2016 Amendment Agreement (which in the case of legal opinions, take into account changes to such legal opinions resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change  

99 

to counsel s form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). Each Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under this subsection 2.11 shall (i) be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $50,000,000 (or $10,000,000, in the case of revolving loans) and (ii) (x) with respect to any Other Loans or Other Commitments in the case of any Revolving Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments being refinanced, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and (y) with respect to any Other Loans or Other Commitments in the case of any Term Loans being refinanced, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date of, and will have a weighted average life to maturity that is not shorter than, the Term Loans being refinanced; provided that the terms and conditions applicable to such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other provisions that are agreed between the Borrower and the lenders thereof and applicable only during periods after the applicable Maturity Date that is in effect on the date such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness is issued, incurred or obtained. Any Refinancing Amendment may provide for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Borrower or other Loan Parties or the provision to the Borrower of swing line loans pursuant to any Other Commitments established thereby, in each case, on terms substantially equivalent to the terms applicable to Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans with the existing Revolving Credit Facility. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment without the consent of any other Lenders to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and Commitments subject thereto as Other Loans and/or Other Commitments). Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this subsection 2.11 and the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such Refinancing Amendment. This subsection 2.11 shall supersede any other provisions in this Agreement (including subsections 2.7 and subsection 10.6) to the contrary.

2.12              Defaulting Lender.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a  Lender  for purposes of voting on any matters (including, but not limited to, any amendment, waiver or consent, provided that such Defaulting Lender s consent shall be required in connection with any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of this Agreement that would to the extent that such modification would increase the amount of or extend the maturity of such Defaulting Lender s Commitments hereunder) with respect to any provision of the Loan Documents that requires the approval of Requisite Lenders or all affected lenders. During any Default Period with respect to a Defaulting Lender (a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to subsection 2.3; (b) to the extent permitted by applicable law, any amounts that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to its Loans and Commitments under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, voluntary and mandatory prepayments, interest and fees) may, in lieu of being distributed to such  

100 

Defaulting Lender, at the written direction of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, be retained by the Administrative Agent and applied in the following order of priority: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and to collateralize indemnification and reimbursement obligations of such Defaulting Lender in an amount reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, second, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Swing Line Lender, third, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender, fourth, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which the Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against the Defaulting Lender as a result of the Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and sixth, to the payment of the Term Loans and Revolving Loans of other Lenders (but not to the Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender; (c) (i) such Defaulting Lender s Revolving Loan Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the Revolving Loan commitment fee payable to Lenders in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Revolving Loan commitment fee pursuant to subsection 2.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender s Revolving Loan Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (ii) such Defaulting Lender s New Term Loan Commitments and outstanding Term Loans shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the Term Loan commitment fee payable to Lenders in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender); and (d) the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.12, performance by Borrower of its obligations hereunder and the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of any Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender or the operation of this subsection 2.12. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this subsection 2.12 are in addition to other rights and remedies which Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender as a result of it becoming a Defaulting Lender and which Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this subsection 2.12 shall alter in any way the Borrower s obligations to repay any Defaulting Lender for Loans that it has actually funded. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to ascertain or inquire as to the existence of any Funds Defaulting Lender or Insolvency Defaulting Lender.

2.13              Removal of Defaulting Lender.   Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that (i) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, (ii) the Default Period for such Defaulting Lender shall remain in effect, and (iii) such Defaulting  

101 

Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which it has become a Defaulting Lender within five Business Days after Borrower s request that it cure such default; then, with respect to each such Defaulting Lender (the   Terminated Lender  ), the Borrower may, by giving written notice to the Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Commitments, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a   Replacement Lender  ) in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.1 and the Borrower shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from an Insolvency Defaulting Lender, and the Funds Defaulting Lender (if not also an Insolvency Defaulting Lender) shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from such Defaulting Lender; provided, (x) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender shall, unless otherwise agreed by such Terminated Lender, pay to such Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (1) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Terminated Lender, (2) an amount equal to all unreimbursed drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (3) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid fees owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to subsection 2.3; (y) on the date of such assignment, Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to subsection 2.6D and subsection 2.7 or otherwise then due and payable to such Terminated Lender under any Loan Document as if it were a prepayment; provided, Borrower may not make such election with respect to any Terminated Lender that is also an Issuing Lender unless, prior to the effectiveness of such election, Borrower shall have caused each outstanding Letter of Credit issued thereby to be cancelled or issued by a new Issuing Lender. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender s Commitments, if any, such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a  Lender  for purposes hereof; provided, any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender. Each Lender agrees that if the Borrower exercises its option hereunder to cause an assignment by such Lender as a Terminated Lender, such Lender shall, promptly after receipt of written notice of such election, execute and deliver all documentation necessary to effectuate such assignment in accordance with subsection 10.1. In the event that a Lender does not comply with the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence within one Business Day after receipt of such notice, each Lender hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver such documentation as may be required to give effect to an assignment in accordance with subsection 10.1 on behalf of a Terminated Lender and any such documentation so executed by the Administrative Agent shall be effective for purposes of documenting an assignment pursuant to subsection 10.1. For the avoidance of doubt, any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

Section 3.             Letters of Credit.  

3.1             Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders  Purchase of Participations Therein.  

A.              Letters of Credit  . The Borrower may request, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1, from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, that an Issuing Lender issue  

102 

Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower or another Loan Party for the purposes specified in the definitions of Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower herein set forth, the Issuing Lenders shall issue such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1;   provided   that the Borrower shall not request that any Issuing Lender issue (and no Issuing Lender shall issue):

B.              Reimbursement by the Borrower of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit  . In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on or before the Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the   Reimbursement Date  ) in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such honored drawing. In the case of any such payment in Dollars of a Letter of Credit denominated in another currency, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, unless the Borrower shall have notified Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 3:00 p.m. (Macau SAR time) on the date such drawing is honored that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely Borrowing Notice to the Administrative Agent requesting the Revolving Loan Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such honored drawing and the Revolving Loan Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing; and   provided  ,   further  , that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such honored drawing, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this subsection 3.3B. 

106 

C.              Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit  .

In the event that any Revolving Loan Lender fails to make available to such Issuing Lender on such business day the amount of such Lender s participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection 3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the rate customarily used by such Issuing Lender for the correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender. 

(ii)             Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received From the Borrower  . In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing such other Lender s Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by such Issuing Lender from the Borrower in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are received.

B.              Nature of Issuing Lenders  Duties  .

110 

(as the case may be) its direct and indirect parents) regarding this Section 3 or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein;

183 

2.7C (but without prejudice to the right of any Lender or Affiliate to later assert any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect to any such Included Taxes occurring after the date of such sale, assignment or transfer).

B.            Assignments. 

(i)              Amounts and Terms of Assignments  . Each Commitment, Loan, participation in a Letter of Credit, or other Obligation may in whole or in part (a) be assigned, in any amount to an Eligible Assignee that is a Lender, or any Affiliate of any Lender or any Approved Fund,   provided   that the provisions of this clause (a) shall not apply to any Affiliate of the Borrower to the extent that such Affiliate becomes a Lender as a result of the provisions of subsection 10.1I, (b) be assigned in an aggregate amount of not less than $2,000,000 (or such lesser amount if contemporaneous assignments approved by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion aggregating not less than $2,000,000 are being made by one or more Eligible Assignees which are Affiliates,   provided   that related Approved Funds shall be treated as one assignor or assignee in determining compliance with such minimum assignment amount) to any Eligible Assignee that is not at such time a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund of a Lender with the giving of notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent;   provided   that with respect to any assignment permitted by this clause (b), so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower shall have provided prior consent to such assignment, such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed and to be deemed given unless the Borrower has notified the assigning Lender of its objection to such proposed transfer within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of a request for such consent or (c) with respect to assignments of Term Loans to the Borrower or Affiliates of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of subsection 10.1I, be assigned in an aggregate amount of not less than the amount specified in subsection 10.1I(ii) with the giving of prompt notice to the Administrative Agent. To the extent of any such assignment in accordance with clause (a), (b) and (c) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations with respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participations therein, or other Obligations or the portion thereof so assigned. The assignor or assignee to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of $2,000 in respect of assignments, and in each case such documentation or other information, if any, with respect to Included Taxes as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7C(vii);   provided  ,   however  , only one such fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more related Approved Funds, and in the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that the Term Loans may be settled through a Settlement Service (defined below) pursuant to subsection 10.1C, only a written or electronic confirmation of such assignment issued by a Settlement Service (a   Settlement Confirmation  ) shall be delivered with respect to assignments settled through the Settlement Service. In the case of any assignment to an Affiliate of the Company permitted pursuant to the definition of Eligible Assignee, such Assignment Agreement may (but shall not be required to), as mutually agreed by the assignor and the assignee, contain a representation that the assignee has no MNPI. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the Assignment Effective Date, (y) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment  

184 

Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (z) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.10B) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement or, if applicable, Settlement Confirmation covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto;   provided   that, anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). The Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning Lender and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of Notes hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall be issued to the assignee and to the assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and the assigning Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, an Affiliate of the Company (other than a Subsidiary of the Company) may be an assignee pursuant to subsection 10.1B.

(ii)              Acceptance by the Administrative Agent; Recordation in Register  . Upon its receipt of (x) an Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee or Eligible Affiliate Purchaser, or (y) if applicable, a Settlement Confirmation representing that the assignee is an Eligible Assignee, together with the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) if applicable, and any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to income tax withholding matters that such assignee may be required to deliver to the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7C(vii), the Administrative Agent shall, if the Administrative Agent has consented to the assignment evidenced thereby (to the extent such consent is required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement or, if applicable, Settlement Confirmation by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any required consent of the Administrative Agent to such assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in the Register (on the same Business Day as it is received if received by 12:00p.m. (Macau SAR time) and on the following Business Day if received after such time) and (c) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement and, if applicable, Settlement Confirmation delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii). The date of such execution of a counterpart or recordation of a transfer shall be referred to herein as the   Assignment Effective Date .  

C.              Settlement Service Mechanics  . Except for assignments of Term Loans pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of subsection 10.1I, the Administrative Agent has the right, but not the obligation, to effectuate assignments of Term Loans (other than New Term Loans) via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent as designated in writing from time to time to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent (the   Settlement Service  ). At any time when the Administrative Agent elects, in its sole discretion, to implement such Settlement Service, each such assignment shall be effected by the assigning  

185 

Lender and proposed assignee pursuant to the procedures then in effect under the Settlement Service, which procedures shall be consistent with the other provisions of this subsection 10.1. Each assignor Lender and proposed assignee shall comply with the requirements of the Settlement Service in connection with effecting any transfer of Loans pursuant to the Settlement Service. The Administrative Agent s consent (but not the Borrower s consent) shall be deemed to have been granted to the extent required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i) with respect to any transfer effected through the Settlement Service. Assignments and assumptions of Term Loans shall be effected by such manual execution until the Administrative Agent notifies Lenders of the Settlement Service as set forth herein. Assignments and assumptions of Revolving Loans and Revolving Loan Commitments shall only be effected by manual execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of an Assignment Agreement at all times. Assignments made pursuant to the foregoing provision shall be effective as of the Assignment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Assignment Agreement to the contrary and so long as no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, payments in respect of the settlement of an assignment of any Term Loans during periods when assignments may be settled through a Settlement Service (but not any Revolving Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment) and with respect to all unpaid interest and commitment fees if any, which have accrued on such Term Loans whether such interest and commitment fees accrued before or after the applicable Assignment Effective Date, shall be made in the manner provided for by the Settlement Service. Any and all fees payable to the Settlement Service shall be paid by the assigning Lender and/or its assignee which becomes a Lender hereunder and the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility whatsoever for payment thereof.

D.              Participations  .

The Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for purposes of subsections 10.4 and 10.5, (a) any participation will give rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to the participant and (b) the participant shall be considered to be a  Lender .  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   Participant Register   provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to  

186 

the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

E.              Assignments to Federal Reserve Banks and Trustees  . In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this subsection 10.1, (i) any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank or (ii) any Lender may pledge all or any portion of its Loans, Commitments, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes, to its creditors or to its trustee (solely in its capacity as trustee) or other representative in support of its obligations to such creditor or trustee;   provided   that (i) no Lender shall, as between the Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank or such creditor or trustee be considered to be a  Lender  or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder. 

F.              Information  . Each Lender may furnish any information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants), subject to subsection 10.20. 

G.              Representations of Lenders  . Each Lender party hereto hereby represents and warrants as of the 2016 Restatement Date, or as of the applicable Assignment Effective Date, or as of the date of the Joinder Agreement pursuant to which such Lender becomes a Lender hereunder that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee or Eligible Affiliate Purchaser; (ii) it has experience and expertise in the making of and/or investing in loans such as the Loans; and (iii) it will make its Loans for its own account in the ordinary course and without a view to distribution of such Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal or state securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this subsection 10.1, the disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement or, if applicable, a Settlement Confirmation shall be deemed to agree that the representations and warranties of such Lender contained in subsection 2(c) of such Assignment Agreement or, if applicable, Settlement Confirmation are incorporated herein by this reference;   provided   that the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower that is an Eligible Affiliate Purchaser shall only be required to make the representations and warranties set forth in clause (i) of this subsection 10.1G, in addition to all other representations and warranties of such Affiliate contained in the Auction Assignment Agreement. 

H.              Subject to Gaming Authorities  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection 10.1, the rights of the Lenders to make assignments of, and grant participations in, any or all of its Commitments or any Loan or Letter of Credit made or issued by it, or any interest therein, herein or in any other Obligations owed to any such Lender, shall be subject to the approval of any applicable gaming authorities, to the extent required by law and to the extent failure to obtain such approval could jeopardize the Gaming License or any other gaming licenses of the Company or any of its parents or Affiliates.

Each Agent (which term shall for the purposes of this subsection 10.20 include the Arrangers), and each Lender (which term shall for the purposes of this subsection 10.20 include the Issuing Lender) shall hold all non-public information regarding the Borrower and its Affiliates and their businesses and obtained by such Agent or such Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such Agent s and such Lender s customary procedures for handling confidential information of such nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking or investment practices, it being understood and agreed by the Borrower that, in any event, the Administrative Agent may disclose such information to the Lenders and each Agent and each Lender may make (i) disclosures of such information to other Lenders, each Agent, the other Loan Parties and SCL, (ii) disclosures of such information to Affiliates of such Lender to its head office and other branches of such Lender or Agent and to their respective agents and advisors (and to other Persons authorized by a Lender or Agent to organize, present or disseminate such information in connection with disclosures otherwise made in accordance with this subsection 10.20), (iii) disclosures of such information reasonably required by any bona fide or potential assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated assignment, transfer or participation of any Loans or any participations therein or by any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the professional advisors thereto) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its obligations (provided, such assignees, transferees, participants, counterparties and advisors are advised of and agree to be bound by either the provisions of this subsection 10.20 or other confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as this subsection 10.20), (iv) disclosure to any rating agency when required by it,   provided   that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates received by such rating agency from any Agent or any Lender, (v) disclosures in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document and (vi) disclosures required or 

202 

requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof or by the NAIC or pursuant to legal or judicial process;   provided  , to the extent permitted by applicable law or court order, each Lender and each Agent shall notify Borrower of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any examination of the financial condition or other routine examination of such Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information. In addition, each Agent and each Lender may disclose the existence of this Agreement and the information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This subsection 10.20 shall supersede all previous agreements between the parties hereto relating to the confidentiality of information.

10.21         Usury Savings Clause.  

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender s option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Borrower.

10.22         Counterparts; Effectiveness.  

This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date hereof.

10.23         USA Patriot Act.  

203 

Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

10.24         Electronic Execution of Assignments.  

The words  execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of like import in any Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

10.25         Judgment Currency.  

The obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars, in Patacas or in HK Dollars, as the case may be (the   Obligation Currency  ), shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent or a Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent or Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the   Judgment Currency  ) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the equivalent in such Obligation Currency of such amount (determined by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 1.4 using the applicable Exchange Rate with respect to such Obligation Currency), in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the   Judgment Currency Conversion Date  ).

If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date.

For purposes of determining the Dollar Equivalent, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

204 

10.26         English.  

The English language shall be the only official and recognized language of this Agreement. If for any reason a translation of this Agreement is required, such translation shall in the event of any dispute be secondary to the original English version which shall take precedence.

10.27         Gaming Authorities.  

The Arrangers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender agree to cooperate with the Macau Gaming Authority and any other applicable gaming authorities in connection with the administration of their regulatory jurisdiction over the Company and its Subsidiaries, including to the extent not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions the provision of such documents or other information as may be requested by the Macau Gaming Authority or any other gaming authority relating to the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Borrower expressly authorizes each Agent and Lender to cooperate with the Macau Gaming Authority and such other gaming authorities as described above.

10.28         No Fiduciary Duty.  

Each Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this subsection 10.28, the  Lenders ), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrower and the Company agree, on behalf of themselves and the other Loan Parties, that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Borrower and the Company acknowledge and agree, on behalf of themselves and the other Loan Parties, that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Loan Party agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Loan Party, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

A.                Pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement, the Lenders (as defined therein, the    Existing Lenders   ) have extended credit to the Borrower in an aggregate amount equal to $3,500,000,000, consisting of (i) $2,250,000,000 original aggregate principal amount of Term B Loans and (ii) $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Revolving Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) (the    Existing Revolving Commitments    and any Revolving Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) made thereunder, the    Existing Revolving Loans   ). 

B.                The Borrower has requested that the Existing Credit Agreement be amended as provided in Section 1 hereof to establish Replacement Revolving Commitments and Replacement Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.24(l) of the Existing Credit Agreement. 

C.                Upon the Second Amendment Effective Date, the terms of the outstanding Existing Revolving Commitments of each Existing Lender that approves this Amendment and offers to replace its Existing Revolving Commitments and Existing Revolving Loan (if any) with Initial Revolving Commitments and Initial Revolving Loans (as such terms are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below)) by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent (or its counsel), on or prior to the Delivery Time, a signature page to this Amendment designating itself as a    Continuing Revolving Lender    (each Existing Lender with an Existing Revolving Commitment that does not so designate itself, being referred to herein as a    Declining Revolving Lender   ) will be modified as set forth herein. 

D.          All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given them in the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below). 

Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1.                   Amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement.   Effective as of the Second Amendment Effective Date: 

(a)         the Existing Credit Agreement (other than the appendices, schedules and exhibits thereto) is hereby amended in accordance with   Exhibit A   hereto (i) by deleting each term thereof which is lined out and (ii) by inserting each term thereof which is double underlined, in each case in the place where such term appears therein (the Existing Credit Agreement, as so amended, together with Amended Appendix A-4 (as defined below), being referred to as the    Amended Credit Agreement    and

(b)        Appendix A-4 to the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety by Appendix A-4 attached as   Exhibit B   hereto (   Amended Appendix A-4   ).

SECTION 2.                  Revolving Commitments.   Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Amended Credit Agreement, as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, each Continuing Revolving Lender agrees (i) that its Initial Revolving Commitment shall be equal to the amount set forth next to its name in Amended Appendix A-4, (ii) that its Existing Revolving Commitment shall be replaced in full by such Initial Revolving Commitment, (iii) that it shall make to the Borrower Initial Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Amended Credit Agreement and (iv) to all other terms of this Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement.

(b)         On the Second Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower shall prepay in full the Existing Revolving Loans (if any), together with all accrued and unpaid fees and interest (the    Prepayment   ).

(c)        The Letters of Credit outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date shall remain outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and the participations therein shall be reallocated on the Second Amendment Effective Date in accordance with Section 2.24(n) of the Existing Credit Agreement.

SECTION 5.                  Fees.

SECTION 6.                  Representations and Warranties.   To induce the other parties hereto to enter into this Amendment, the Borrower represents and warrants to each of the other parties hereto, that: (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4 of the Amended Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents are true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of the date hereof (or, with respect to any representations or warranties that are themselves modified or qualified by materiality or a  Material Adverse Effect  standard, such representations or warranties are true, correct and complete in all respects on and as of the date hereof), except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true, correct and complete in all material respects as of such earlier date (or, with respect to any representations or warranties that are themselves modified or qualified by materiality or a  Material Adverse Effect  standard, such representations or warranties were true, correct and complete in all respects as of such earlier date) and (b) after giving effect to this Amendment, no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

SECTION 7.                  Effectiveness.   This Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement shall become effective as of the first date (the    Second Amendment Effective Date   ) that each of the following conditions have been satisfied: 

(a)         The Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received counterparts of this Amendment that, when taken together, bear the signatures of (i) the Borrower, (ii) the Guarantors, (iii) the New Lenders, (iv) the Administrative Agent, (v) the Collateral Agent, (vi) the Swing Line Lender, (vii) the Issuing Lender and (viii) each Continuing Revolving Lender.

(b)         The Borrower shall have paid (i) to the Administrative Agent, the fees payable on the Second Amendment Effective Date referred to in Section 5, (ii) to the Administrative Agent and to the Arrangers, all fees and other amounts due and payable to them on or prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date, including, to the extent invoiced, reimbursement or payment of all  out-of-pocket expenses required to be reimbursed or paid by the Borrower in connection with this Amendment and (iii) to each Revolving Lender under the Amended Credit Agreement, the fees set forth in    Exhibit C    hereto. 

(c)         The Borrower shall have made the Prepayment and the Commitment Termination, and shall have paid all amounts required to be paid by it in connection therewith.

Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors, by its signature below, hereby (a) confirms its respective guarantees, pledges and grants of security interests, as applicable, under each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and agrees that,  notwithstanding the effectiveness of this Amendment or the Amended Credit Agreement, such guarantees, pledges and grants of security interests shall continue to be in full force and effect and shall continue to accrue to the benefit of the Lenders and the Secured Parties and (b) confirms that all of the representations and warranties made by it contained in the Amended Credit Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents are true, correct and complete in   

all material respects on and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true, correct and complete in all material respects as of such earlier date.

SECTION 9.                  Effect of Amendment .  (a)  All references in the other Credit Documents to the Existing Credit Agreement shall be deemed to refer without further amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed as a substitution or novation, or a payment and reborrowing, or a termination, of the Obligations outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement or instruments guaranteeing or securing the same, which shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified hereby or by instruments executed concurrently herewith.  Nothing expressed or implied in this Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby or thereby shall be construed as a release or other discharge of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement or the Borrower or any other Credit Party under any Credit Document from any of its obligations and liabilities thereunder, and such obligations are in all respects continuing with only the terms being modified as provided in this Amendment and in the Amended Credit Agreement.  The Existing Credit Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents shall remain in full force and effect, until and except as modified hereby.

BY   

EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AMENDMENT, EACH CREDIT PARTY, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (A) ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS; (B) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (C) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO THE APPLICABLE CREDIT PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 10.1 OF THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT; (D) AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (C) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICABLE CREDIT PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT; AND (E) AGREES THAT AGENTS AND LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY CREDIT PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

The Issuance Notice shall specify (i) the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) whether the Letter of Credit is to be a Standby Letter of Credit or a Commercial Letter of Credit, (iii) the face amount of the Letter of Credit, (iv) the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, (v) the name and address of the beneficiary, and (vi) either the verbatim text of the proposed Letter of Credit or the proposed terms and conditions thereof, including a precise description of any documents to be presented by the beneficiary which, if presented by the beneficiary prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, would require the Issuing Bank to make payment under the Letter of Credit;   provided   that the Issuing Bank, in its reasonable discretion, may require changes in the text of the proposed Letter of Credit or any such documents; and   provided  ,   further,   that no Letter of Credit shall require payment against a conforming draft to be made thereunder on the same business day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the office of the Issuing Bank to which such draft is required to be presented is located) that such draft is presented if such presentation is made after 10:00 a.m. (in the time zone of such office of the Issuing Bank) on such business day. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3.2, Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit only in accordance with Issuing Bank s standard operating procedures. Upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each Lender with a Revolving Commitment of such issuance, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit and the amount of such Lender s respective participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.4(e). Borrower shall notify the applicable Issuing Bank (and the Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Bank) prior to the issuance of any Letter of Credit in the event that any of the matters to which Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Issuance Notice is no longer true and correct as of the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, and upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be deemed to have recertified, as of the date of such issuance, as to the matters to which Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Issuance Notice.

(c)                    Responsibility of Issuing Bank With Respect to Requests for Drawings and Payments  .  In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Issuing Bank shall be responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. As between Borrower and Issuing Bank, Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing Bank, by the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank, including any Governmental Acts; none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of Issuing Bank s rights or powers hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, any action taken or omitted by Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not give rise to any liability on the part of Issuing Bank to Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.4(c), Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against Issuing Bank for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank. 

(d)                   Reimbursement by Borrower of Amounts Drawn or Paid Under Letters of Credit  . In the event Issuing Bank has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit, it shall immediately notify Borrower and Administrative Agent, and Borrower shall reimburse Issuing Bank on or before the second Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the   Reimbursement Date )  in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing;   provided,   anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, unless Borrower shall have notified Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date such drawing is honored that Borrower intends to reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely Funding Notice to Administrative Agent requesting Lenders with Revolving Commitments to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to the amount of such honored drawing, and Lenders with Revolving Commitments shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of such honored drawing; and   provided     further,   if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by Issuing Bank on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Borrower shall reimburse Issuing Bank, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this Section 2.4(d) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender with a Revolving Commitment from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and Borrower shall retain any and all rights  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

48 

it may have against any such Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this Section 2.4(d).

(e)                    Lenders  Purchase of Participations in Letters of Credit  .  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender having a Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have purchased, and hereby agrees to irrevocably purchase, from Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Revolving Commitments) of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder. In the event that Borrower shall fail for any reason to reimburse Issuing Bank as provided in Section 2.4(d), Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each Lender with a Revolving Commitment of the unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such Lender s respective participation therein based on such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Commitments. Each Lender with a Revolving Commitment shall make available to Issuing Bank an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of Issuing Bank specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first business day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of Issuing Bank is located) after the date notified by Issuing Bank. In the event that any Lender with a Revolving Commitment fails to make available to Issuing Bank on such business day the amount of such Lender s participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 2.4(e), Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon for three Business Days at the rate customarily used by Issuing Bank for the correction of errors among banks and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this Section 2.4(e) shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender with a Revolving Commitment to recover from Issuing Bank any amounts made available by such Lender to Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section in the event that it is determined that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit in respect of which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Issuing Bank. In the event Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.4(e) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under this Section 2.4(e) with respect to such honored drawing such Lender s Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by Issuing Bank from Borrower in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on   Appendix B   or at such other address as such Lender may request. 

(f)                     Obligations Absolute.   The obligation of Borrower to reimburse Issuing Bank for drawings honored under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving Loans made by Lenders pursuant to Section 2.4(d) and the obligations of Lenders under Section 2.4(e) shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under all circumstances including any of the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), Issuing Bank, Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a Lender, against Borrower, whether in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured); (iii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi) any breach hereof or any other Credit Document by any party thereto; (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or (viii) the fact 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

49 

that an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;   provided,   in each case, that payment by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank under the circumstances in question.

(g)                   Indemnification.   Without duplication of any obligation of Borrower under Section 10.2 or 10.3, in addition to amounts payable as provided herein, Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless Issuing Bank from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which Issuing Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by Issuing Bank, other than as a result of (1) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank or (2) the wrongful dishonor by Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by it, or (ii) the failure of Issuing Bank to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any Governmental Act. 

2.5.               Pro Rata Shares; Availability of Funds. 

(a)                    Pro Rata Shares.   All Loans shall be made, and all participations purchased, by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender s obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby nor shall any Revolving Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in such other Lender s obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby. 

(b)                   Availability of Funds.   Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable Credit Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender s Loan requested on such Credit Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Credit Date and Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount on such Credit Date. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent s demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the rate payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans for such Class of Loans. Nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Term Loan Commitments and Revolving Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 

2.6.                 Use of Proceeds   .   The proceeds of the Term Loans, Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit shall be applied by Borrower to repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement (or, with respect to the Initial Revolving Loans, to repay Existing Revolving Loans (as defined in the Second Amendment)), for working capital and general corporate purposes of Borrower and its Affiliates, including Investments (including Investments in Excluded Subsidiaries and Affiliates to fund costs of development projects undertaken by such Excluded Subsidiaries and Affiliates) permitted hereunder, Restricted Payments permitted hereunder for corporate overhead expenses or  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

50 

permitted to be made in lieu of certain Investments, and to finance fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. No portion of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall be used in any manner that causes or might cause such Credit Extension or the application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors or any other regulation thereof or to violate the Exchange Act.

2.7.                 Evidence of Debt; Register; Lenders  Books and Records; Notes  .  

(a)                    Lenders  Evidence of Debt.   Each Lender shall maintain on its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the Obligations of Borrower to such Lender, including the amounts of the Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower, absent manifest error;   provided   that the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender s Revolving Commitments or Borrower s Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans; and   provided  ,   further,   in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender s records, the recordations in the Register shall govern. 

(b)                   Register.   Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) shall maintain at the Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders and the Revolving Commitments and Loans of each Lender from time to time (the   Register ).  The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any Lender (with respect to any entry relating to such Lender s Loans) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall record, or shall cause to be recorded, in the Register the Revolving Commitments and the Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6, and each repayment or prepayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans (and any cancellations of Term Loans pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 10.6(j)), and any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest error;   provided   that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender s Revolving Commitments or Borrower s Obligations in respect of any Loan. Borrower hereby designates Scotiabank to serve as Borrower s agent solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this Section 2.7, and Borrower hereby agrees that, to the extent Scotiabank serves in such capacity, Scotiabank and its officers, directors, employees, agents, sub-agents and affiliates shall constitute  Indemnitees.  

(c)                    Notes.   If so requested by any Lender by written notice to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or at any time thereafter, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to Section 10.6) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is delivered after the Closing Date, promptly after Borrower s receipt of such notice) a Note or Notes to evidence such Lender s Term B Loan, Other Term Loan, Revolving Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. 

2.8.               Interest on Loans. 

(a)                  Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Class of Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof as follows: 

(i)        in the case of Revolving Loans:

(1)        if a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin; or

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

51 

(2)        if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin;

(ii)       in the case of Swing Line Loans, at the Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin; and

(iii)      in the case of Term B Loans and Other Term Loans:

(1)        if a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin; or

(2)        if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin per annum.

(b)                 The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan which can be made and maintained as Base Rate Loans only), and the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be selected by Borrower and notified to Administrative Agent and Lenders pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be. If on any day a Loan is outstanding with respect to which a Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice has not been delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day such Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. 

(c)                  In connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans there shall be no more than fifteen Interest Periods outstanding at any time. In the event Borrower fails to specify between a Base Rate Loan or a Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Rate Loan) will be automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then-current Interest Period for such Loan (or if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan will remain as, or (if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan). In the event Borrower fails to specify an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month. As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and each Lender. 

(d)                 Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(a) shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Term Loan, the last Interest Payment Date with respect to such Term Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded;   provided,   if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day s interest shall be paid on that Loan. 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

52 

(e)                  Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Loan (i) with respect to Loans, shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect to interest accrued on and to each such Interest Payment Date; (ii) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears upon any prepayment of that Loan, whether voluntary or mandatory, to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid; and (iv) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears at maturity of the Loans, including final maturity of the Loans;   provided  ,   however,   with respect to any voluntary prepayment of a Base Rate Loan, accrued interest shall instead be payable on the applicable Interest Payment Date. 

(f)                   Borrower agrees to pay to Issuing Bank, with respect to drawings honored under any Letter of Credit, interest on the amount paid by Issuing Bank in respect of each such honored drawing from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower at a rate equal to (i) for the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the applicable Reimbursement Date, the rate of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans made ratably by the Lenders with Revolving Commitments, and (ii) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans made ratably by the Revolving Lenders. 

(g)                 Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(f) shall be computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. Promptly upon receipt by Issuing Bank of any payment of interest pursuant to Section 2.8(f), Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender, out of the interest received by Issuing Bank in respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which Issuing Bank is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans), the amount that such Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for such period if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of Credit. In the event Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by Lenders for all or any portion of such honored drawing, Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under Section 2.4(e) with respect to such honored drawing such Lender s share of any interest received by Issuing Bank in respect of that portion of such honored drawing so reimbursed by Lenders for the period from the date on which Issuing Bank was so reimbursed by Lenders to but excluding the date on which such portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed by Borrower. 

2.9.               Conversion/Continuation. 

(a)                  Subject to Section 2.18, Borrower shall have the option: 

(i)        to convert at any time all or any part of any Term Loan or Revolving Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount from one Type of Loan to another Type of Loan;   provided,   a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless Borrower shall pay all amounts due under Section 2.18 in connection with any such conversion; or

(ii)       upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

53 

(b)                 Borrower shall deliver a Conversion/Continuation Notice to Administrative Agent no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). A Conversion/Continuation Notice shall specify (i) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount and type of the Loan to be converted/continued, (iii) the nature of the proposed conversion/continuation, (iv) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the requested Interest Period, and (v) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan, if the Requisite Lenders request in writing, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Conversion/Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loans (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other Person authorized to act on behalf of Borrower or for otherwise acting in good faith under this Section 2.9(b), and upon conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice Borrower shall have effected a conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder. 

2.10.              Default Interest   .   The principal amount of all overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments thereon or any past due fees or other amounts owed hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder with respect to the applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans that are Initial Revolving Loans);   provided,   in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder for the applicable Base Rate Loan. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this Section 2.10 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender. 

2.11.              Fees  .  

(a)                  Borrower agrees to pay to Lenders (in the case of any Defaulting Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 2.22(a)(iii)) having Revolving Exposure: 

(i)        commitment fees equal to (A) the average of the daily difference between (1) the Revolving Commitments and (2) the aggregate principal amount of (x) all outstanding Revolving Loans plus (y) the Letter of Credit Usage, times (B) the Applicable Revolving Commitment Fee Percentage; and

(ii)       letter of credit fees equal to (A) the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans, times (B) the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under all such Letters of Credit (regardless of whether any conditions for drawing could then be met and determined as of the close of business on any date of determination).

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

54 

All fees referred to in this Section 2.11(a) shall be paid to Administrative Agent at its Principal Office and upon receipt, Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (using the Applicable Revolving Commitment Fee Percentage and Applicable Margin appropriate to the Class of Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender).

(b)                 Borrower agrees to pay directly to Issuing Bank, for its own account, the following fees: 

(i)        a fronting fee equal to 0.125%, per annum, times the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under all Letters of Credit (determined as of the close of business on any date of determination); and

(ii)       such customary documentary and processing charges for any issuance, amendment, transfer or payment of a Letter of Credit as are in accordance with Issuing Bank s standard schedule for such charges and as in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Credit Parties may use a portion of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds to prepay or repurchase New Senior Notes and other Indebtedness of the Credit Parties that ranks pari passu in right of security with the Loans  ( Pari Passu Indebtedness )  to the extent the indenture or other agreement therefor requires the Credit Parties to prepay or make an offer to purchase such Pari Passu Indebtedness with the proceeds of such Asset Sale, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x) the amount of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Pan Passu Indebtedness with respect to which such a requirement to prepay or make an offer to purchase  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

57 

exists and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness and the outstanding principal amount of Loans on the date of such prepayment.

(b)                   Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds.

Concurrently with any prepayment of the Loans and/or reduction of the Revolving Commitments pursuant to Sections 2.14(a) through 2.14(c), Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Officer s Certificate demonstrating the calculation of the amount (the   Net Proceeds Amount )  of the applicable Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net Loss Proceeds or Net Debt Proceeds, as the case may be, that gave rise to such prepayment. In the event that Borrower shall subsequently determine that the actual amount received exceeded the amount set forth in such certificate, Borrower shall promptly make an additional prepayment of the Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an amount equal to such excess, and Borrower shall concurrently therewith deliver to Administrative Agent an Officer s Certificate demonstrating the derivation of the additional Net Proceeds Amount resulting in such excess.

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

58 

shall not be required to exercise any rights or remedy under Section 8 in order to draw on the Conforming L/Cs and (ii) any drawing on a Conforming L/C shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of Default.

(d)                   Application of Prepayments of Loans to Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar  Rate Loans.

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

59 

each case, in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(c).

2.16.           General Provisions Regarding Payments. 

(a)                  All payments by Borrower of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due at the Principal Office designated by Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders; for purposes of computing interest and fees, funds received by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day. 

(b)                 All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan (other than voluntary prepayments of Revolving Loans) shall be accompanied by payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest then due and payable before application to principal. 

(c)                  Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) shall promptly distribute to each Lender at such address as such Lender shall indicate in writing, such Lender s applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments of principal and interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due thereto, including all fees payable with respect thereto, to the extent received by Administrative Agent. 

(d)                 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any Conversion/ Continuation Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter. 

(e)                 Subject to the provisos set forth in the definition of  Interest Period  as they may apply to Revolving Loans, whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any Loan shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to Revolving Loans only, such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the Revolving Commitment fees hereunder. 

(f)                   Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to charge Borrower s accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that purpose);   provided   that with respect to fees and expenses, the Administrative Agent has delivered to Borrower an invoice setting forth the amounts due in reasonable detail, and Borrower has not paid such amounts within three Business Days. 

(g)                 Administrative Agent shall deem any payment by or on behalf of Borrower hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) to be a non-conforming payment. Any such payment shall not be deemed to have been received by Administrative Agent until the later of (i) the time such funds become available funds, and (ii) the applicable next Business Day. Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic notice to Borrower and each applicable Lender (confirmed in writing) if any payment is non-conforming. Any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1(a). Interest shall continue to accrue on any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made until such funds become available funds (but in no event less than the period from the date of such  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

60 

payment to the next succeeding applicable Business Day) at the rate determined pursuant to Section 2.10 from the date such amount was due and payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

(h)                 If an Event of Default shall have occurred and not otherwise been waived, and the maturity of the Obligations shall have been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1, all payments or proceeds received by Agents hereunder in respect of any of the Secured Obligations, shall be applied in accordance with the application arrangements described in Section 7.2 of the Security Agreement. 

3.17.              Ratable Sharing   .   Lenders hereby agree among themselves that, unless otherwise provided in the Collateral Documents or Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 hereof with respect to amounts realized from the Collateral, if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker s lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (collectively, the   Aggregate Amounts Due   to such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (a) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them;   provided,   if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest;   provided, further,   that the provisions of this Section 2.17 shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in any payment or disbursement made by the Issuing Bank pursuant to a Letter of Credit to any assignee or participant in any drawing under a Letter of Credit. Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker s lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by Borrower to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder. 

2.18.           Making or Maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans. 

(a)                    Determining Applicable Interest Rate.   As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and each Lender. In the event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

61 

telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by Borrower with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be a request for the making of, conversion to, or continuation of the applicable Loans as Base Rate Loans.

(b)                   Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans.   In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be made only after consultation with Borrower and Administrative Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become impracticable, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an   Affected Lender   and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (1) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (2) to the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or continue such Loan as or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (3) the Affected Lender s obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the   Affected Loans )  shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 2.18(b) shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms hereof. 

(c)                    Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods  .  Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by such Lender to Lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Funding Notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/ Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment of, or any conversion of, any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

62 

last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; or (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender for any amount under this paragraph if the event (or change in law or regulation or other action) giving rise to such loss, expense or liability occurred more than 180 days prior to the date such Lender submits the statement referred to in the preceding sentence.

(d)                   Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans.   Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender. 

(e)                    Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans.   Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of America;   provided, however,   each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19. 

2.19.           Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. 

(a)                    Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes  . Subject to the provisions of Section 2.20 (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.19(a)) shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of a court or Governmental Authority, in each case, that becomes effective after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the Closing Date by any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law): (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or the Administrative Agent to any additional Tax (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes that are indemnified under Section 2.20 and (B)   Excluded Taxes) with respect to this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents or any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the London interbank market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

63 

otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender or the Administrative Lender, as applicable for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.19(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender for any amount under this paragraph if the event (or change in law or regulation or other action) giving rise to such loss, expense, liability, additional Tax or increased cost occurred more than 180 days prior to the date such Lender submits the statement referred to in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

(b)                   Capital Adequacy Adjustment.   In the event that any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.19(b)) shall have determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the Closing Date of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender s Loans or Revolving Commitments or Letters of Credit, or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section 2.19(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender for any amount under this paragraph if the event (or change in law or regulation or other action) giving rise to such loss, expense or liability occurred more than 180 days prior to the date such Lender submits the statement referred to in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

(a)                    Payments to Be Free and Clear.   All sums payable by or on behalf of any Credit Party hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

64 

free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax other than (i) net income taxes, franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) and U.S. federal backup withholding taxes, in each case imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent s or such Lender s having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, secured or perfected a security interest under, engaged in any other transaction pursuant to, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or sold or assigned an interest in any Loan or Credit Document), (ii) any branch profits taxes or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause (i) above, (iii) any taxes that are attributable to the applicable Lender s failure to comply with the requirements of Section 2.20(c), (iv) in the case of any Non-US Lender, any U.S. federal withholding taxes resulting from any law in effect (including FATCA) on the date such Non-US Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender s assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Borrower under Section 2.23), to receive additional amounts from Borrower with respect to such non excluded Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.20 (such excluded taxes hereinafter referred to as   Excluded Taxes ),  or (v) any taxes that are imposed as a result of any event occurring after the Lender becomes a Lender other than a change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order or any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof.

(b)                   Withholding of Taxes.   If any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent or any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Tax other than an Excluded Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Credit Documents (such Person, the   Withholding Agent ),  then: (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall make such deduction or withholding; (ii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the applicable law; and (iii) the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made. 

(c)                    Evidence of Payments.   As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.20, such Credit Party shall deliver to Administrative Agent a copy of the receipt or other evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority. 

(d)                   Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.   The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the applicable law any Other Taxes. 

(e)                    Indemnification by the Borrower.   The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.20), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(g)                 Status of Lenders. 

(i)        Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Credit Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Lender shall, whenever a lapse of time or change in circumstances renders such documentation (including any specific documents required below in clause (g)(ii)) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to do so. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding three sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.20(d)(ii)(1), (d)(ii)(2) and (d)(ii)(4) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (g), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.

(ii)       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(1)

each Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent) executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue Service (  IRS  ) Form W-9, certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

(2)

each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(3) 
 any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Holder becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(4) 
 If a payment made to any Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

67 

documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.20(g)(ii)(4),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

(h)                   Treatment of Certain Refunds.   If a Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund that it determines in its sole discretion is in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.20(b), it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over the amount of such refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to Taxes giving rise to such refund) net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such refund);   provided   that Borrower, upon request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus any penalty, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other Person. 

(i)                    Survival.   Each party s obligations under this Section 2.20 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document. 

(j)                     Issuing Banks and Swing Line Lenders.   For the avoidance of doubt, the term  Lender,  for purposes of this Section 2.20, shall include the Issuing Bank and any Swing Line Lender. 

2.21.             Obligation to Mitigate   .   Each Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.21) agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender responsible for administering its Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or maintain its Credit Extensions, including any Affected Loans, through another office of such Lender, or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such other office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the interests of such Lender;   provided,   such Lender will not be obligated to utilize such other office pursuant to this Section 2.21 unless Borrower agrees to pay all  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

68 

incremental expenses incurred by such Lender as a direct result of utilizing such other office as described above. A certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.21 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that it will not request compensation under Sections 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 unless such Lender or Issuing Bank requests compensation from borrowers under other lending arrangements with such Lender or Issuing Bank who are similarly situated.

2.22.            Defaulting Lenders. 

(a)                   Defaulting Lender Adjustments.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: 

(i)                 Waivers and Amendments.   Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of  Requisite Lenders . 

(ii)               Defaulting Lender Waterfall.   Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, following an Event of Default or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.4 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:  first,  to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder,  second,  to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender hereunder,  third,  if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank, to be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank hereunder,  fourth,  as the Borrower may request (so long as no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent,  fifth,  if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement,  sixth,  to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement,  seventh,  so long as no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and  eighth,  to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 

(iii)             Certain Fees. 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

69 

(1) 
 No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender. 

(2) 
 Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit fees pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(ii) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its pro rata share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided cash collateral. 

(3) 
 With respect to any such commitment fee or letter of credit fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the Issuing Bank s or the Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 

(iv)             Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata Commitments (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment.   Subject to Section 10.28, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 

(v)               Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans  . If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within three (3) Business Days following the written request of the (i) Administrative Agent or (ii) the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),  (x)first,  prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y)  second,  cash collateralize the Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure. 

(b)                   Defaulting Lender Cure.   If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

70 

Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender;   provided, further,   that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.

(c)                   New Swing Line Loans/Letters of Credit.   So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto. 

2.23.             Removal or Replacement of a Lender . Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) (i) any Lender (an   Increased-Cost Lender  ) shall give notice to Borrower that such Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, (ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender or which entitle such Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect, and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice within five Business Days after Borrower s request for such withdrawal; or (b) (i) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Lender shall remain a Defaulting Lender, and (iii) such Defaulting Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which it has become a Defaulting Lender within five Business Days after Borrower s request that it cure such default; or (c) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as contemplated by Section 10.5(b), the consent of the Requisite Lenders or a majority of the applicable class of Lenders or affected Lenders, as the case may be, shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders (each a   Non-Consenting Lender  ) whose consent is required shall not have been obtained; then, with respect to each such Increased-Cost Lender, Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender (the   Terminated Lender  ), Borrower may, by giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Revolving Commitments, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a   Replacement Lender  ) in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 and Borrower shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from an Increased-Cost Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender and the Defaulting Lender shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from such Defaulting Lender;   provided,   (1) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender shall pay to the Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (a) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Terminated Lender, (b) an amount equal to all unreimbursed drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (c) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid fees owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.11; (2) on the date of such assignment, Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(c), 2.19 or 2.20; or otherwise as if it were a prepayment and (3) in the event such Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a Non-Consenting Lender and such assignment (together with any other assignments pursuant to this Section 2.23 or otherwise) will result in the applicable amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent being approved;   provided,   Borrower may not make such election with respect to any Terminated Lender that is also an Issuing Bank unless, prior to the effectiveness of such election, Borrower shall have caused each outstanding Letter of Credit issued thereby to be cancelled or cash collateralized on terms reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender s Revolving  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

71

Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum amount of $100,000,000, or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount or, in each case, such lesser amount approved by the Administrative Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments are requested to become effective and (iii) in the case of Incremental Term Loan Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make term loans with terms identical to Term B Loans or (y) commitments to make term loans with pricing, maturity, amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments and/or other terms different from the Term B Loans  ( Other Term Loans ).  

(b)                 The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Lender.

72 

by the Administrative Agent in the reasonable exercise of its judgment, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be subject to clause (v) below),

(v)             with respect to any Other Term Loan that ranks pari passu in right of security with the Term B Loans, the All-In Yield shall be the same as that applicable to the Term B Loans on the Closing Date, except that the All-In Yield in respect of any such Other Term Loan may exceed the All-In Yield in respect of such Term B Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-In Yield (such difference, the   Term Yield Differential )  then the Applicable Margin (or the  LIBOR floor  as provided in the following proviso) applicable to such Term B Loans shall be increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield Differential shall not exceed 0.50%;   provided   that, to the extent any portion of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher  LIBOR floor  being applicable to such Other Term Loans, such floor shall only be included in the calculation of the Term Yield Differential to the extent such floor is greater than the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in effect for an Interest Period of three months  duration at such time, and, with respect to such excess, the  LIBOR floor  applicable to the outstanding Term B Loans shall be increased to an amount not to exceed the  LIBOR floor  applicable to such Other Term Loans prior to any increase in the Applicable Margin applicable to such Term B Loans then outstanding; 

(vi)           with respect to Incremental Revolving Loans, the All-In Yield of such Incremental Revolving Loans shall be the same as that applicable to the Initial Revolving Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date, except that the All-In Yield in respect of any such Incremental Revolving Loans may exceed the All-In Yield in respect of such Initial Revolving Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-In Yield (such difference, the   Revolving Yield Differential )  then the Applicable Margin applicable to such Initial Revolving Loans shall be increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Revolving Yield Differential shall not exceed 0.50%;

The Borrower agrees that Section 2.18(c) shall apply to any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.

SECTION 7.   GUARANTY

7.1.                  Guaranty of the Obligations .  Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2, Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranty to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Beneficiaries the due and punctual payment in full of all Secured Obligations when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.   362(a)) (collectively, the  Guaranteed Obligations ). 

7.2.                  Contribution by Guarantors .  All Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves (collectively, the  Contributing Guarantors ), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor (a  Funding Guarantor ) under this Guaranty such that its Aggregate Payments exceeds its Fair Share as of such date, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors (which right shall not supersede any Beneficiary s right to remaining unpaid amounts guaranteed by such Contributing Guarantors) in an amount sufficient to cause each Contributing Guarantor s Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date.  Fair Share  means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (a) the ratio of (i) the Fair Share Contribution Amount with respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (ii) the  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

115 

aggregate of the Fair Share Contribution Amounts with respect to all Contributing Guarantors multiplied by (b) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Fair Share Contribution Amount  means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty that would not render its obligations hereunder or thereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any comparable applicable provisions of state law;   provided,   solely for purposes of calculating the Fair Share Contribution Amount with respect to any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this Section 7.2, each of (A) any assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder and under any guaranty of other Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 7.2, pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount, and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement (including any such right of contribution under this Section 7.2), and  (B)  any liabilities of such Guarantor in respect of intercompany indebtedness to Borrower or other Affiliates of Borrower to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder, shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor.   Aggregate Payments   means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (1) the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty (including in respect of this Section 7.2),   minus   (2) the aggregate amount of all payments received on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor from the other Contributing Guarantors as contributions under this Section 7.2. The amounts payable as contributions hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the applicable Funding Guarantor. Each Guarantor is a third party beneficiary to the contribution agreement set forth in this Section 7.2. In no event shall any Guarantor be required to contribute more than its Fair Share Contribution Amount toward the payment of Obligations under its Guaranty.

7.3.                  Payment by Guarantors .  Subject to Section 7.2, Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Beneficiary may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of Borrower to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.   362(a)), Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in Cash, to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Beneficiaries, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guaranteed Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (including interest which, but for Borrower s becoming the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against Borrower for such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other Guaranteed Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid. 

7.4.                  Liability of Guarantors Absolute .  Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows: 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

116 

(a)                 this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectibility. This Guaranty is a primary obligation of each Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety; 

(b)                 Administrative Agent may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between Borrower and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence of such Event of Default; 

(c)                 the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of Borrower and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the obligations of Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against Borrower or any of such other guarantors and whether or not Borrower is joined in any such action or actions; 

(d)                 payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any Guarantor s liability for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any Guarantor s covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor s liability hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; 

(e)                 any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any Guarantor s liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such security, in each case as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine consistent herewith or the applicable Hedging Agreement and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against Borrower or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Credit Documents or any Hedging Agreements; and 

(f)                  this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

117 

knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Credit Documents or any Hedging Agreements, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including provisions relating to events of default) hereof, any of the other Credit Documents, any of the Hedging Agreements or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms hereof or such Credit Document, such Hedging Agreement or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guaranteed Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Credit Documents or any of the Hedging Agreements or from the proceeds of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations, even though any Beneficiary might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any Beneficiary s consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any collateral which secures any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which Borrower may allege or assert against any Beneficiary in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

7.5.                 Waivers by Guarantors . Each Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of Beneficiaries: (a) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against Borrower, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any Deposit Account or credit on the books of any Beneficiary in favor of Borrower or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever; (b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of Borrower or any other Guarantor including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Borrower or any other Guarantor from any cause other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any Beneficiary s errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor s obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor s liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

118 

dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of default hereunder, the Hedging Agreements or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to Borrower and notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 7.4 and any right to consent to any thereof; and (g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms hereof

7.6.                  Guarantors  Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, etc .  Until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary. In addition, until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any such right of contribution as contemplated by Section 7.2. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against Borrower or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such other guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been finally and indefeasibly paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof. 

7.7.                  Subordination of Other Obligations .  Any Indebtedness of Borrower or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the   Obligee Guarantor  ) is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof 

7.8.                  Continuing Guaranty .  This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has yet been made) shall have been paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled or been cash collateralized  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

119 

on terms satisfactory to the Issuing Bank. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

7.9.                  Authority of Guarantors or Borrower .  It is not necessary for any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or Borrower or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any of them. 

7.10.               Financial Condition of Borrower .  Any Credit Extension may be made to Borrower or continued from time to time, and any Hedging Agreements may be entered into from time to time, in each case without notice to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of Borrower at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such Hedging Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantor s assessment, of the financial condition of Borrower. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from Borrower on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of Borrower and its ability to perform its obligations under the Credit Documents and the Hedging Agreements, and each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Borrower and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of Borrower now known or hereafter known by any Beneficiary. 

7.11.             Bankruptcy, etc. 

(a)                  So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Lenders, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding of or against Borrower or any other Guarantor. The obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Borrower or any other Guarantor or by any defense which Borrower or any other Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding. 

(b)                 Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in clause (A) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantors and Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve Borrower of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar Person to pay Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced. 

(c)                 In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid by Borrower, the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

120 

any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder.

7.12.               Discharge of Guaranty Upon Sale of Guarantor .  If all of the Equity Interests of any Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or otherwise disposed of (including by merger or consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the Guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be, hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released without any further action by any Beneficiary or any other Person effective as of the time of such sale or disposition.

Subject to Section 10.5, without further written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, may execute any documents or instruments necessary or reasonably requested by Borrower to (i) in connection with a sale or disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement to a Person that is not a Credit Party, release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of such sale or other disposition of assets or to which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 10.5) have otherwise consented, (ii) (x) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral in connection with the incurrence of Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such Collateral permitted under Section 6.2(n) to the extent and for so long as the contract or other agreement in which such Lien is granted validly prohibits the creation of any other Lien on such assets and proceeds or (y) release the Liens on the assets and property of any  Guarantors  under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement that granted Liens on  Collateral  under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement to the extent such  Guarantors  under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement are not Guarantors hereunder, (iii) release any Guarantor from the Guaranty pursuant to Section 7.12 or with respect to which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 10.5) have otherwise consented, or (iv) subordinate the Liens of the Collateral Documents to Liens permitted under Section 6.2(w) and the documents creating such Liens and to implement and/or create customary arrangements and agreements in connection with residential condominium (or  condo-hotel  or  timeshare ) units and associations otherwise permitted hereunder. In connection with any disposition or release of any Collateral pursuant to the terms of any Credit Document, at Borrower s request and expense, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to Borrower such documents (including UCC-3 termination statements) as Borrower may reasonably request to evidence or effect such release. 

(b)                   Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guaranty.   Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by Collateral Agent at such sale or other disposition. 

(c)                   Rights under Hedging Agreements.   No Hedging Agreement will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Lender Counterparty that is a party thereto any rights in connection with  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

129 

the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Guarantor under the Credit Documents except as expressly provided in Section 10.5(c)(v) of this Agreement and Section 8 of the Security Agreement.

9.9.                 Withholding Taxes  .   To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The agreements in this Section 9.9 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the term  Lender,  for purposes of this Section 9.9, shall include the Issuing Bank and any Swing Line Lender. 

9.10.             Intercreditor Agreements  .  

Each Lender hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders (and the other Secured Parties), to enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent with any holders of any secured Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Sections 6.1(d), (r) or (s) or, at the request of Borrower, Sections 6.1(f) or (j), or otherwise consented to by the Lenders in accordance with Section 10.5, and to amend the Collateral Documents as contemplated by Section 5.18, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each such agreement.

10.3.              Indemnity  .  

(a)                  Each Credit Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the each Agent and Lender, their affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, controlling persons, members and successors and assigns (each, an   Indemnitee )  from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which any such Indemnitee may become subject arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Amendment Agreement and the other Credit Documents or any related transaction or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, regardless of whether any such Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by any Credit Party or any of affiliates or shareholders of any Credit Party), and to reimburse each such Indemnitee upon demand for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing,   provided   that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnitee, apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses to the extent they are found in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted (x) from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee (or of the affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, controlling persons and members of such Indemnitee), or (y) from the material breach of such Indemnitee s obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages in connection with its activities related to any of the foregoing. 

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

132 

(b)                 No Credit Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnitee for any amount paid or payable by any Indemnitee in the settlement of any action, proceeding or investigation without such Credit Party s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;   provided, however   that such Credit Party s indemnification obligation in respect of such action, proceeding or investigation herein (other than such settlement payments made without such Credit Party s consent) shall continue in full force and effect. Promptly after receipt by any Indemnitee of notice of its involvement in any action, proceeding or investigation, such Indemnitee shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against any Credit Party under this Section 10.3, notify such Credit Party in writing of such involvement. Failure by an Indemnitee to so notify such Credit Party shall relieve such Credit Party from the obligation to indemnify such Indemnitee under this Section 10.3 only to the extent that such Credit Party suffers material prejudice to substantial rights and defenses as a result of such failure. 

(c)                 If any person is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.3 with respect to any action or proceeding brought by a third party, the Credit Parties shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such action or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee. Upon assumption by the Credit Parties of the defense of any such action or proceeding, such Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in such action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Credit Parties shall not be liable for any fees and legal expenses of other counsel or the fees or disbursements of other providers of professional services subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Credit Parties have agreed to pay such reasonable and documented fees and expenses, (ii) the Credit Parties shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee in a timely manner, or (iii) such Indemnitee shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Credit Parties and such Indemnitee or among Indemnitees, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnitees that are different from or additional to those available to the Credit Parties or other Indemnitees;   provided, however,   that the Credit Parties shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar actions or proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnitees, except to the extent that local counsel (limited to one separate firm of attorneys in each separate jurisdiction) and/or a single firm of attorneys acting as special gaming counsel for all Indemnitees, in each case, in addition to regular counsel, are required in order to effectively defend against such action or proceeding and, except in the case of clause (iii) above, a separate firm of attorneys for such affected Indemnitees. The Credit Parties shall not consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended by the Credit Parties in accordance with the foregoing without the prior written consent of each applicable Indemnitee unless such compromise or settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of each such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of each such Indemnitee. 

10.4.             Set-off.    In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by each Credit Party at any time or from time to time subject to the consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), without notice to any Credit Party or to any other Person (other than Administrative Agent), any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of any Credit Party to such Lender hereunder, the Letters of Credit and participations therein and under the other Credit Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected  

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

133 

hereto, the Letters of Credit and participations therein or with any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not (A) such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or  (B)  the principal of or the interest on the Loans or any amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 2 and although such obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured;   provided   that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.

10.5.              Amendments and Waivers  .  

(a)                    Requisite Lenders  Consent.   Subject to the additional requirements of Sections 10.5(b) and 10.5(c), no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of the Requisite Lenders;   provided   that Administrative Agent may, with the consent of Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mutual mistake among all parties hereto, defect or inconsistency, so long as such amendment, modification or supplement either (x) does not adversely affect the rights of any Lender or Issuing Bank, or (y) reflects the intent of all parties to the applicable Credit Document at the time of its execution. 

(b)                   Affected Lenders  Consent.   Without the written consent of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) that would be directly and adversely affected thereby, no amendment, modification, termination, or consent shall be effective if the effect thereof would: 

(i)               extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or Note; 

(ii)              waive, reduce or postpone any scheduled repayment (but not prepayment); 

(iii)            extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the expiration of the Availability Period; 

(iv)           reduce the rate of interest on any Loan (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable to any Loan pursuant to Section 2.10) or any fee or any premium payable hereunder; 

(v)             extend the time for payment of any such interest or fees; 

(vi)            reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit; 

(vii)          amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of Section 2.13(b)(ii), this Section 10.5(b), Section 10.5(c) or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides that the consent of all Lenders is required; 

(viii)         amend the definition of  Requisite Lenders  or  Pro Rata Share  or amend Section 2.16(c), 2.17, or 10.5(a) in a manner intended to effect such a change;   provided,    

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

134 

with the consent of Requisite Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant hereto may be included in the determination of  Requisite Lenders  or  Pro Rata Share  on substantially the same basis as the Term Loan Commitments, the Term Loans, the Revolving Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Closing Date;

(ix)            release all or substantially all of the Collateral, or release Guarantors comprising a material portion of the aggregate value of the Guarantees from the Guaranty, except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents; 

(x)              consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under any Credit Document; or 

(xi)            amend, waive or otherwise modify (a) any of the terms and provisions (and related definitions) of Section 6.6, (b) any of the terms and provisions of the proviso set forth in Section 8.1(c) or (c) with respect to any Credit Extension after the Closing Date, any of the express terms and provisions set forth in Section 3.2 without the written consent of the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Exposure, taken as a whole, and, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, any such amendment, waiver or other modification shall be effective for all purposes of this Agreement with the written consent of only the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Exposure, taken as a whole (or Administrative Agent with the prior written consent thereof), on the one hand, and Borrower, on the other hand. 

(c)                   Other Consents.   No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, shall:

Credit and Guaranty Agreement

135 

Lender Counterparty differently than the Lenders without the written consent of any such Lender Counterparty; or

(vi)            amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of Section 9 as the same applies to any Agent, or any other provision hereof as the same applies to the rights or obligations of any Agent, in each case without the consent of such Agent. 

(d)                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) in accordance with the terms hereof with the written consent of the Requisite Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to permit additional extensions of credit to be outstanding hereunder from time to time and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Loans and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the holders of such extensions of credit in any determination of the requisite lenders required hereunder, including Requisite Lenders.

Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this Section 10.5 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by a Credit Party, on such Credit Party.

(a)                   Generally.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Affiliates of each of the Agents and Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. Subject to Section 10.6(b) and Section 10.6(c), each Lender shall have the right at any time to (i) sell, assign or transfer to any Eligible Assignee, or (ii) sell participations to any Eligible Assignee or any other Person (and in the case of any other Person, with the approval of Borrower) in all or any part of its Commitments or any Loan or Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit or participations therein or any other interest herein or in any other Obligations owed to it;   provided   that no such sale, assignment, transfer or participation shall, without the consent of Borrower, require Borrower to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify such sale, assignment, transfer or participation under the securities laws of any state;   provided, further   that no such sale, assignment or transfer described in clause (i) above shall be effective unless and

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.6, no Lender shall, as between Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any granting of participations in, all or any part of its Commitments or the Loans, the Letters of Credit or participations therein, or the other Obligations owed to such Lender.

Assignments and assumptions of Revolving Loans and Revolving Loan Commitments shall only be effected by manual execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an Assignment Agreement at all times.

Any and all fees payable to the Settlement Service shall be paid by the assigning Lender and/or its assignee which becomes a Lender hereunder and Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility whatsoever for payment thereof. 

(e)                   Representations and Warranties of Assignee.   Each Lender (other than an Affiliate Lender), upon execution and delivery hereof or upon succeeding to an interest in the Commitments and Loans, as the case may be, represents and warrants as of the Closing Date or as of the Assignment Effective Date that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it has experience and expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or loans such as the applicable Commitments or Loans, as the case may be; and (iii) it will make or invest in, as the case may be, its Commitments or Loans for its own account in the ordinary course and without a view to distribution of such Commitments or Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Section 10.6, the disposition of such Commitments or Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control).

(h)                   Certain Other Assignments and Participations.   In addition to any other assignment or participation permitted pursuant to this Section 10.6 any Lender may, without notice to or consent from the Administrative Agent or Borrower, assign and/or pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed by or to such Lender, and its Notes, if any, to secure obligations of such Lender including to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank or any central banking authority;   provided,   that no Lender, as between Borrower and such Lender, shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge, and   provided further,   that in no event shall the applicable Federal Reserve Bank, pledgee or trustee, be considered to be a  Lender  or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

10.17.          Confidentiality   .

10.18.          Usury Savings Clause   .   Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall

The words  execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of like import in any Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
