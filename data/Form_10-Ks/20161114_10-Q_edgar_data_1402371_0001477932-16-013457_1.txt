      Table of Contents           ELRAY RESOURCES, INC.     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (Unaudited)      NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Elray Resources, Inc. ("Elray" or the "Company"), a Nevada Company formed on December 13, 2006, has been providing marketing and support for online gaming operations.     The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Elray Resources, Inc. ( Elray  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2016.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 have been omitted.       Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Allowance for doubtful accounts      The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, allowances for doubtful accounts was $5,520 and $0, respectively.      Derivative Instruments      Derivatives are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black- Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations.      Debt Discount      Debt discount is amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method.      Revenues      Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.      Stock-Based Compensation      Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock and stock options awarded in return for services rendered. The expense is measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is typically the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest.                 6       
      Table of Contents           Loss Per Common Share      Basic loss per common share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. During a loss period, the potentially dilutive securities have an anti-dilutive effect and are not included in the calculation of dilutive net loss per common share. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, potentially dilutive securities include notes convertible to 37,222,228,889 and 38,482,328,944 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, potentially dilutive securities also include preferred stock convertible to 2,126 and 2,363 shares of the Company s common stock, respectively.      Subsequent Events      Elray evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued for disclosure purposes.      Reclassification      Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that creates common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance supersedes most preexisting revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with an option to adopt the standard one year earlier. The new standard is to be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.     In February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.     Elray s management does not believe that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.     NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN     The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Elray have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company sustained a net loss of $226,913 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit and stockholders  deficit of $10,338,204 and $10,325,669 respectively, at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for Elray to continue as a going concern. Elray's management plans on raising cash from public or private debt or equity financing, on an as needed basis, and in the longer term, revenues from the gambling business. Elray's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on these additional cash financings, and, ultimately, upon achieving profitable operations through the development of its gambling business.     NOTE 3   SETTLEMENT PAYABLE     On December 20, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Tarpon Bay Partners LLC ( Tarpon ) whereby Tarpon acquired certain notes and accounts payable against the Company in the amount of $2,656,214. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company and Tarpon submitted the settlement agreement to the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Leon County, Florida for a hearing on the fairness of the agreement and the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for the shares that will be issued to Tarpon for resale ( Settlement Shares ). 75% of the proceeds less all applicable fees and charges from the resale of the Settlement Shares will be remitted to the original claim holders of the Company ( Remittance Amount ). The Company agreed to issue sufficient shares to generate proceeds such that the aggregate Remittance Amount equals $2,656,214. Additionally, the Company agreed to issue a convertible note of $132,000, maturing in 6 months and convertible to the Company s common stock at a 50% of the lowest closing bid price for the 20 days prior to the conversion. The settlement agreement was effective on January 27, 2014 when the court granted approval.                   7

On January 27, 2014, the court granted an approval of the settlement agreement with Tarpon whereby the Company would issue shares to Tarpon for resale to pay off certain liabilities. As a result, principal of $247,500 and associated accrued interest acquired by Tarpon were reclassified to settlement payable.

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   NOTE CONVERSION FEATURE     Due to the conversion features contained in the convertible notes issued, the actual number of shares of common stock that would be required if a conversion of the note as further described in Note 4 was made through the issuance of the Company s common stock cannot be predicted, and the Company could be required to issue an amount of shares that may cause it to exceed its authorized share amount. As a result, the conversion feature requires derivative accounting treatment and will be bifurcated from the note and  marked to market  each reporting period through the income statement. The fair value of the conversion future of these notes was recognized as a derivative liability instrument and will be measured at fair value at each reporting period.            The Company remeasured the fair value of the instrument as of September 30, 2016, and recorded an unrealized gain of $792,698 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

( Elray  or  Company ) was incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2006.      On February 23, 2011, Elray entered into a Purchase Agreement (the  Splitrock Agreement ) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Splitrock Ventures (BVI) Limited ( Splitrock ), a British Virgin Islands company, as consideration for the issuance of 197 shares of common stock of the Company. Splitrock is in the online gaming business. On the closing date, pursuant to the terms of the Splitrock Agreement, Anthony Goodman, representing the shareholders of Splitrock, acquired the 197 shares of Elray s common stock, which resulted in a change of control under which 70% of the shares of Elray are now held by the previous shareholders of Splitrock (Share number adjusted for Reverse Stock Split). In accordance with the Splitrock Agreement, Barry J. Lucas resigned as Chairman and Director and Anthony Goodman was elected as a replacement; Neil Crang resigned as Director and Donald Radcliffe and Roy Sugarman were elected as replacements; and Michael J. Malbourne resigned as Secretary and David E Price, Esq. was appointed as a replacement.     On December 9, 2011, Elray entered into an Amended Purchase Agreement ( Amended Splitrock Agreement ) which amended certain elements of the Splitrock Agreement originally entered into by the parties of February 23, 2011. Whereas under the Splitrock Agreement, the Company was to acquire 100% of the shares of Splitrock, pursuant to the Amended Splitrock Agreement, the Company shall instead acquire only certain assets and liabilities of Splitrock.     The existing officers and directors of Elray resigned and the directors nominated by Splitrock; Messrs. Radcliffe, Sugarman, and Goodman, were elected to the board of Elray. Mr. Goodman was appointed Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of Elray. On October 27, 2011, Donald Radcliffe resigned as director and Michael Silverman was appointed as his replacement.     As part of the Amended Splitrock Agreement, Elray acquired gaming intellectual property, gaming domains, trademarks and player databases ( Splitrock IP ), and is currently in the process of developing a new online casino utilizing third party software. Elray s strategy is to provide online gaming to players in markets where such activities are legal.     The Company has opened a virtual managed corporate office located in Las Vegas in order to meet potential requirements put forth by lawmakers in pending state and federal legislation. Under the proposed bills, Internet-enabled gaming operations must adhere to strict rules including locally-based operations and technology that allows for IP address restrictions and user age verification.           On April 10, 2013, the Company entered into a 12-month consultancy agreement with online casino operator, Universal Technology Investments Limited ("UTI"). The company would assist in the marketing and support of UTI's online casino for a twelve-month term with a provision to provide additional services as UTI expands their gaming portfolio. The consultancy service was not started until January 2014. This agreement not only brings operating revenue to the company, but also solidifies the expertise in the online gaming market, and assists in positioning the company with respect to being a premier turnkey service provider for both the online and mobile gaming sector.     On January 23, 2014, the Company entered into a Know-How and Asset Purchase Agreement, with VTG and Gold Globe Investments Limited, a BVI company ( GGIL ). VTG and GGIL are engaged in the development of web technology and have jointly developed both an E-store and a virtual exchange platform that facilitate trading of virtual items and casino credits as well as bitcoins. The Company acquired these assets to assist the Company to continue to build and support its marketing and support business for online casinos and social games.      On June 27, 2016, the Company s Board of Director approved a reverse split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001, at a ratio of 150:1, such that every 150 shares of common stock becomes 1 shares of common stock, reducing the number of authorized shares to 10 million. The reverse split is yet to be approved by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.     On August 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Articulate Pty Ltd ( Articulate ), a company provides online intellectual property includes CRM systems, payment gateway system and back office marketing systems. Articulate agreed to provide online gaming support and marketing services to Elray. Both parties worked together to provide service to e-commerce and gaming companies. The agreement was made effective on August 1, 2016.      Plan of Operation      Elray has developed and acquired unique valuable technology that provides state of the art turnkey, marketing tools and CRM systems for online gaming operators.     Our primary competition is expected from overseas based online gaming technology companies. With few exceptions, significant listed gaming companies (many of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange) operate using their own software. As an independent online gaming technology provider, we believe that we retain the ability to provide the best turnkey solutions allowing operators to choose the best of breed and most profitable content available. Additionally, by ensuring that we operate in compliance with U.S. laws, we believe that in the event of legalized gaming in the U.S., we would not be precluded from taking advantage of U.S.-based gaming.      Results of Operations       Three months ended September 30, 201  6   compared to the three months ended September 30, 201  5  .

Our cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,052 compared $44,783 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Since its inception, the Company has financed its cash requirements from the sale of common stock, issuance of notes and shareholder loans. Uses of funds have included activities to establish our business, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses.     Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate sufficient revenues, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.      Material Events and Uncertainties      Our operating results are difficult to forecast. Our prospects should be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable development stage companies.     There can be no assurance that we will successfully address such risks, expenses and difficulties.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
