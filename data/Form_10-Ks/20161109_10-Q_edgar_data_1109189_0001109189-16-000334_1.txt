CAUTIONARY STATEMENT 
  REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This quarterly report contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be,  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition of our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the risk factors discussed in this quarterly report and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors, most of which are beyond our control. 
  The words  believe,   may,   estimate,   continue,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   expect,   indicate  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this quarterly report are forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report are based upon reasonable assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this quarterly report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
  Important factors that may affect our expectations, estimates or projections include: 
             
    a decline in, or substantial volatility of, oil or natural gas prices, and any related changes in expenditures by our customers; 
                
    the effects of future acquisitions on our business; 
                
    changes in customer requirements in markets or industries we serve; 
                
    competition within our industry; 
                
    general economic and market conditions; 
                
    our access to current or future financing arrangements; 
        our ability to replace or add workers at economic rates;  
     environmental and other governmental regulations; 
             
    our ability to replace or add workers at economic rates; 
                
    environmental and other governmental regulations; 
                
    our ability to obtain approval by the Bankruptcy Court of our Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization or any other plan of reorganization, including the treatment of the claims of our lenders and trade creditors, among others; 
                
    our ability to obtain approval with respect to motions in our Chapter 11 cases and the Bankruptcy Court s rulings in our Chapter 11 cases and the outcome of our Chapter 11 cases in general; 
                
    the length of time we and our subsidiaries will operate under our Chapter 11 cases; 
                
    risks associated with third-party motions in our Chapter 11 cases, which may interfere with our ability to develop and consummate our Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization or other plan of reorganization; 
                
    the potential adverse effects of our Chapter 11 cases on  our liquidity, results of operations or business prospects; 
                
    the ability to execute our business and restructuring plan; and 
                
    increased legal and advisor costs related to our Chapter 11 cases and other litigation and the inherent risks involved in a bankruptcy process.

     Table of Contents  

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
  This quarterly report includes market share and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from internal company surveys (including estimates based on our knowledge and experience in the industry in which we operate), market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information, and industry publications and surveys. Industry surveys and publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. Although we believe such information is accurate and reliable, we have not independently verified any of the data from third party sources cited or used for our management s industry estimates, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. For example, the number of onshore well servicing rigs in the U.S. could be lower than our estimate to the extent our two larger competitors have continued to report as stacked rigs equipment that is not actually complete or subject to refurbishment. Statements as to our position relative to our competitors or as to market share refer to the most recent available data.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016   (unaudited)  
   
  1. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Basic Energy Services, Inc. and subsidiaries ( Basic  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. Certain information relating to our organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in accordance with GAAP and financial statement requirements promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made in the accompanying unaudited financial statements. 
  Nature of Operations     
  Basic provides a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, fluid services, well servicing and contract drilling. These services are primarily provided using Basic s fleet of equipment. Basic s operations are concentrated in the major United States onshore oil and gas producing regions in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Montana, West Virginia, Ohio, California, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. 
  Risks and Uncertainties 
  Voluntary Petitions Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code 
    
  On October 25, 2016, Basic and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with Basic, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions (the  Bankruptcy Petitions,  and the cases commenced thereby, the  Chapter 11 Cases ) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Court ) to pursue a balance sheet restructuring pursuant to a Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of the Debtors (as proposed, the  Prepackaged Plan ). The Debtors  Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption   In re Basic Energy Services, Inc. et al.   (Case No. 16-12320). No trustee has been appointed, and the Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as  debtors in possession  under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. Basic expects to continue its operations without interruption during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. To assure ordinary course operations, the Court approved on an interim basis a variety of  first day  motions seeking various relief and authorizing the Debtors to maintain their operations in the ordinary course. The Debtors expect to receive approval of the  first day  motions on a final basis on or before November 18, 2016.  A summary of the key features of the Prepackaged Plan was included in Item 1.01 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 24, 2016. 
    
  The subsidiary Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases are Basic Energy Services GP, LLC; Basic Energy Services LP, LLC; Basic Energy Services, L.P.; Basic ESA, Inc.; Chaparral Service, Inc.; SCH Disposal, L.L.C.; Sledge Drilling Corp.; Admiral Well Service, Inc.; Basic Marine Services, Inc.; JS Acquisition LLC; Permian Plaza, LLC; Maverick Coil Tubing Services, LLC; First Energy Services Company; JetStar Holdings, Inc.; Xterra Fishing   Rental Tools Co.; Maverick Solutions, LLC; LeBus Oil Field Service Co.; Acid Services, LLC; Taylor Industries, LLC; Maverick Stimulation Company, LLC; Globe Well Service, Inc.; JetStar Energy Services, Inc.; Platinum Pressure Services, Inc.; Maverick Thru-Tubing Services, LLC; MCM Holdings, LLC; MSM Leasing, LLC; and The Maverick Companies, LLC. 
       
  Restructuring Support Agreement 
  On October 23, 2016, Basic and its Debtor subsidiaries entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the  RSA ) with   100%   of the lenders under Basic s Term Loan Credit Agreement (the  Consenting Term Loan Lenders ) and holders of over   80%   (the  Consenting Noteholders,  and collectively with the Consenting Term Loan Lenders, the  Required Restructuring Support Parties ) of Basic s   7.75%   Senior Notes due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ) and Basic s   7.75%   Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes,  and together with the 2019 Notes, the  Unsecured Notes ). Under the RSA, each of the Required Restructuring Support Parties agreed to, among other things: (i) vote any claim it holds against the Debtors to accept the  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

Prepackaged Plan and not (a) change or withdraw (or cause to be changed or withdrawn) its vote to accept the Prepackaged Plan, (b) object to, delay, impede, or take any other action to interfere with, delay, or postpone acceptance, consummation, or implementation of the Prepackaged Plan, or (c) propose, file, support, or vote for any restructuring, sale of assets, workout, or plan of reorganization of the Debtors other than the Prepackaged Plan and (ii) subject to certain exceptions, limit its ability to transfer the indebtedness it holds. 
    
  Under the RSA, the Debtors agreed to, among other things: (i) take all reasonably necessary and proper action and use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debtors  restructuring in accordance with the RSA; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to meet the milestones set forth in the RSA; (iii) act in good faith and use reasonable best efforts to support and complete successfully the related solicitation of votes to obtain sufficient acceptances of the Prepackaged Plan (the  Solicitation  (iv) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all required regulatory approvals and third-party approvals of the Debtors  restructuring; (v) not directly or indirectly seek or solicit any discussions relating to, or enter into any agreements relating to, any alternative proposals; (vi)  not take any actions inconsistent with the RSA and any other related documents executed by the Debtors; (vii) provide draft copies of all material motions, applications, or other documents that the Debtors intend to file with the Court to the Required Restructuring Support Parties  counsel at least   three   calendar days prior to the date when the Debtors intend to file such document, or as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than   one   business day, where   three   calendar days  notice is not reasonably practicable; and (viii) support and take all actions that are necessary and appropriate to facilitate approval of the disclosure statement related to the Solicitation (the  Disclosure Statement ), confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan and consummation of the Debtors  restructuring in accordance with the RSA.  
    
  The RSA is terminable by the Required Restructuring Support Parties or the Debtors under certain conditions. The termination provisions include the failure of a backstop agreement to be effective in accordance with its terms or the termination of such backstop agreement, as well as several milestone dates, including, among other things, with respect to (i) a failure by the Debtors to commence the Solicitation; (ii) a failure by the Debtors to commence chapter 11 proceedings and file the Prepackaged Plan and the Disclosure Statement; (iii) a failure by the Court to enter an order approving the Disclosure Statement; and (iv) a failure by the Court to enter an order confirming the Prepackaged Plan. The RSA and the obligations of all parties thereto may be terminated by mutual agreement by the Debtors and the Required Restructuring Support Parties. 
    
  Proposed Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization 
    
  Pursuant to the RSA, the Company commenced the Solicitation on October 24, 2016. In connection with the commencement of the Solicitation, the Disclosure Statement was distributed to certain creditors of the Company. Included in the Disclosure Statement is a proposed form of Prepackaged Plan. The Prepackaged Plan, which is subject to approval of the Court, anticipates that, among other things, on the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan (the  Effective Date ): 

The existing shares of Basic will be canceled, and reorganized Basic Energy Services, Inc. will issue (i) new common shares (the  New Common Shares ) and (ii)   seven   (  7  ) year warrants (the  Warrants ) entitling their holders upon exercise thereof, on a pro rata basis, to   6%   of the total outstanding New Common Shares (after giving effect to the conversion of the New Convertible Notes (as defined below)) at a per share price based upon a total equity value of   $1,789,000,000   of the reorganized Company, which New Common Shares and Warrants will be distributed as set forth below; 

In connection with a rights offering (the  Rights Offering ), which shall be open to participation by eligible holders of the Company s 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes and backstopped by certain supporting holders of Unsecured Notes, the Company will issue   9%   paid-in-kind ("PIK") interest unsecured notes due 2019 in the aggregate principal amount of   $131,250,000   (the  New Convertible Notes ), mandatorily convertible into common stock within   36   months or sooner upon the occurrence of certain events; 

The Company s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014, as amended (the  ABL Credit Agreement ) will be amended or restated or replaced with similar financing; 

The Company s Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2016 (the  Term Loan Agreement ), will be amended and restated on identical terms, subject to certain agreed upon changes set forth in the Prepackaged Plan, and the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement have agreed under the Prepackaged Plan to waive payment of the Applicable Premium (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Agreement) triggered by the Chapter 11 filing; 

The Unsecured Notes will be canceled and discharged and the holders of those Unsecured Notes will receive New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate,   99.5%   of the New Common Shares issued on the Effective Date, and which upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes (assuming such conversion occurs   36   months after the Effective  
     
   10 

     Table of Contents  

Date) will comprise   51.22%   of the total outstanding New Common Shares (in each case subject to dilution by the proposed management incentive plan and the New Common Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants).  Eligible holders of Unsecured Notes will also receive   100%   of the subscription rights to acquire   $125,000,000   in New Convertible Notes in accordance with Rights Offering procedures to be approved by the Court; 

Each holder of existing equity interests in the Company will receive its pro rata share of (i) New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate,   0.5%   of the New Common Shares issued on the Effective Date, and which upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes (assuming such conversion occurs   36   months after the Effective Date) will comprise   0.26%   of the total outstanding New Common Shares (in each case subject to dilution by the proposed management incentive plan and the New Common Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and (ii) the Warrants; and 

Holders of allowed claims arising under the Company s proposed debtor-in-possession credit facility (the  DIP Facility ), administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, other priority claims, other secured claims and general unsecured creditors of the Company will receive in exchange for their claims payment in full in cash or otherwise have their rights unimpaired under the Bankruptcy Code.   
       
  Upon the consummation of the Prepackaged Plan, all unvested existing management equity-based compensation plans will be canceled. Reorganized Basic expects to implement a management incentive plan pursuant to which certain officers and employees of reorganized Basic will be eligible to receive, in the aggregate, cash and/or shares and/or options to acquire shares of New Common Stock up to   10%   of our total outstanding New Common Stock at the discretion of our reorganized Board of Directors. 
    
  Backstop Agreement 
    
  Basic entered into a backstop agreement (the  Backstop Agreement ) on October 25, 2016, pursuant to which the investors set forth in the Backstop Agreement (the  Investors ) agreed to backstop (the  Backstop Commitments ) the Rights Offering. Pursuant to the Backstop Commitments, each of the Investors, severally and not jointly, agreed to fully participate in the Rights Offering and purchase the New Convertible Notes in accordance with the percentages set forth in the Backstop Agreement to the extent unsubscribed under the Rights Offering. To compensate the Investors for the risk of their undertakings in the Backstop Agreement and as consideration for the Backstop Commitments, Basic plans to pay the Investors, subject to approval by the Court, in the aggregate, on the Effective Date, a backstop put premium in an amount equal to   five   percent of the aggregate amount of the Rights Offering, in the form of   $6.25   million aggregate principal amount of New Convertible Notes. 
  The Backstop Agreement is terminable by Basic and/or the Requisite Investors (as defined in the Backstop Agreement) under several conditions. The termination provisions include, among others, (i) the termination of the RSA, (ii)    failure to meet certain milestone dates consistent with the RSA, or (iii) a material breach by either Basic or one or more of the Investors of any of the respective party s undertakings, representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the Backstop Agreement that remains uncured for   five   business days after the breaching party receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. Basic may be required to pay a termination fee in the amount of   $6.25   million to non-defaulting Investors if the Backstop Agreement is terminated as a result of the board exercising its fiduciary duties and terminating the RSA, the Court enters an order refusing to confirm the Prepackaged Plan or an injunction is issued against consummation of the transaction. There will be no over-subscription privilege in the Rights Offering. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Basic and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Basic has no variable interest in any other organization, entity, partnership or contract. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
    
  Accounting Estimates  
  Preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management uses historical and other pertinent information to determine these estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas where critical accounting estimates are made by management include: 
    
     Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets 
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

Impairment of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets 
     Allowance for doubtful accounts 
     Litigation and self-insured risk reserves 
     Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition  
     Stock-based compensation 
     Income taxes 

2.  Going Concern 
  The significant risks and uncertainties related to the Chapter 11 Cases raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  This assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
  The Company incurred a net loss of   $265.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a net loss of   $241.7 million    for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be from cash on hand, cash from operations and, until emergence from Chapter 11, financing under our DIP Facility. Our secured term lenders and certain of our noteholders have committed to provide up to   $90.0 million   under the DIP Facility, of which, we received   $30.0 million   on October 26, 2016. We are in active discussions with potential lenders to find a replacement for our prepetition   $100.0 million   asset-based revolving credit facility.

  On September 28, 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Temporary Limited Waiver with respect to the ABL Limited Waiver (the  ABL Waiver Amendment ). The ABL Waiver Amendment extended the termination of the ABL Limited Waiver to the earliest to occur of (i) the occurrence or existence of any event of default under the Modified ABL Facility, other than the event of default specified in the ABL Limited Waiver, (ii) notice from the ABL Administrative Agent or the certain required lenders of the occurrence or existence of any Temporary Limited Waiver Default (as defined in the ABL Limited Waiver), (iii) the date on which the related forbearance of the 2019 Notes has terminated or (iv) the later of October 16, 2016 or such later date as certain required lenders and the Company may agree in their respective sole discretion.

  The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost  beginning on January 1, 2016, and retrospectively for all periods presented.  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The unamortized value of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the Modified ABL Facility continue to be presented as an asset on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described in Note 1.   Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations  , constituted events of default under the following debt instruments (the  Debt Instruments ): 

The Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of February 17, 2016, as amended, by and among Basic, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent; 

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 26, 2014, as amended, by and among Basic, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer; 

Indenture dated as of October 16, 2012, among the Company, as issuer, the guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor trustee, which governs the 2019 Notes; and

     Table of Contents  

The Debt Instruments provide that as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal and accrued interest due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations under the Debt Instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, and the holders  rights of enforcement in respect of the Debt Instruments are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.      Because the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default of the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes that accelerated the Company's obligations, the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes were classified as current liabilities at September 30, 2016.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , Basic had   no   borrowings and   $51.1 million   of letters of credit outstanding under its Modified ABL Facility, giving Basic   $16.4 million   of available borrowing capacity based on its borrowing base determined as of such date.   
    
  Basic s interest expense consisted of the following (in thousands):   

7. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental 
  Basic is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that establish standards and requirements for protection of the environment. Basic cannot predict the future impact of such standards and requirements, which are subject to change and can have retroactive effectiveness. Basic continues to monitor the status of these laws and regulations. Management believes that the likelihood of any of these items resulting in a material adverse impact to Basic s financial position, liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations is remote.  
  Currently, Basic has not been fined, cited or notified of any environmental violations that would have a material adverse effect upon its financial position, liquidity or capital resources. However, management does recognize that by the very nature of its business, material costs could be incurred in the near term to bring Basic into total compliance. The amount of such future expenditures is not determinable due to several factors, including the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions which may be required, the determination of Basic s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such expenditures are recoverable from insurance or indemnification.  
  Litigation 
    
  On October 25, 2016, the Company commenced the Chapter 11 Cases, in an effort to implement the restructuring pursuant to the RSA. While the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stays certain actions against us, including actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of our bankruptcy estates, we have been granted by the Court under interim orders to pay certain general unsecured prepetition claims in the ordinary course of business notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. The Prepackaged Plan, if confirmed, will provide for the treatment of claims against our bankruptcy estates, including pre-petition liabilities that have not otherwise been satisfied or addressed during the Chapter 11 Cases. 
  From time to time, Basic is a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that Basic considers to be a part of the ordinary course of business. Basic is not currently involved in any legal proceedings that it considers probable or reasonably possible, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Self-Insured Risk Accruals 
  Basic is self-insured up to retention limits as it relates to workers  compensation, general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of its employees. Basic generally maintains no physical property damage coverage on its workover rig fleet, with the exception of certain of its 24-hour workover rigs and newly manufactured rigs. Basic has deductibles per occurrence

     Table of Contents  

for workers  compensation, general liability claims, automobile liability and medical coverage of   $2.5 million  ,   $1.0 million  ,   $1.0 million  , and   $400,000  , respectively. Basic maintains accruals in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions based upon third-party data and claims history. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , self-insured risk accruals totaled approximately   $29.8 million   and   $30.8 million  , respectively, and these amounts are included in other long-term liabilities and accrued expenses. 
   
  8. Stockholders  Equity 
  Common Stock 
  In March 2016, Basic granted various employees   790,263   restricted shares of common stock that vest over a   three  -year period. 
  Treasury Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Basic may purchase up to an additional   $9.5 million   of Basic s shares of common stock under the repurchase program. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , Basic did not repurchase any shares under the repurchase program. 
  Basic has acquired treasury shares through net share settlements for payment of payroll taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock. Basic acquired a total of   220,768   shares through net share settlements during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   216,870   shares through net share settlements during the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
   
  9. Incentive Plan 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , compensation expense related to share-based arrangements was approximately   $2.2 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively. For compensation expense recognized during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , Basic recognized a tax benefit of approximately   $1.2 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , compensation expense related to share-based arrangements was approximately   $7.4 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively. For compensation expense recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Basic recognized a tax benefit of approximately   $3.8 million  . 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $10.3 million   of total unrecognized compensation related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company's long-term incentive plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.7   years. The total fair value of share-based awards vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $2.5 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was   no   excess tax benefit due to the net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL ). If there were   no   NOL, then there would have been an excess tax benefit of approximately   $11,000   at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Stock Option Awards 
  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Options granted under the Company's long-term incentive plan expire   10 years   from the date they are granted, and generally vest over a   three  - to   five  -year service period. 
  The following table reflects changes during the   nine  -month period and a summary of stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016  :

  Cash received from share option exercises under the Company's long-term incentive plan was approximately   $724,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was   no   excess tax benefit due to the NOL. If there was   no   NOL, there would have been   no   tax benefit for at September 30, 2016, and   no   excess tax benefit at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Restricted Stock Awards 
     A summary of the status of Basic s non-vested share grants at   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is presented in the following table: 

Phantom     Stock Awards 
  On March 24, 2016, Basic s Board of Directors approved grants of performance-based phantom stock awards to certain members of management. The performance-based phantom stock awards are tied to Basic s achievement of total stockholder return ( TSR ) relative to the TSR of a peer group of energy services companies over the performance period (defined as the   two  -year calculation period starting on the 20th New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) trading day prior to and including the last NYSE trading day of 2015 and ending on the last NYSE trading day of 2017). The number of phantom shares to be issued will range from   0%   to   150%   of the   705,263   target number of phantom shares, depending on the performance noted above. Any phantom shares earned at the end of the performance period will then remain subject to vesting in one-half increments on March 15, 2018 and 2019 (subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances). The Board of Directors also approved grants of phantom restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The number of phantom shares issued was   552,100  . These grants remain subject to vesting annually in one-third increments over a   three  -year period, with the first portion vesting March 15, 2017 (subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances). 
    
  Key Employee Retention Plan and Key Employee Incentive Plan 
    
  In June 2016, in order to retain top-tier executive talent, Basic entered into (i) Key Employee Retention Bonus ("KERP") agreements with certain of its employees, and (ii) Key Employee Incentive Bonus ("KEIP") agreements with certain of its executive officers. The Company s Board of Directors authorized the KERP and KEIP, which are designed to supplement Basic s existing employee compensation programs. The KERP and KEIP programs are to be paid in cash. The first and second installments of the KERP were paid in June and August. The remaining payments are expected to be paid during November 2016 and February 2017. The first payment of the KEIP was paid in June 2016, the second was paid in October 2016, upon the filing of the Chapter 11 petition. The remaining payment under the KEIP is expected to be paid upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11.    
    
  Under the retention bonus agreements, if prior to June 20, 2017 either (i) a recipient voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company other than as an eligible retirement or (ii) his employment is terminated by the Company for cause then the recipient will both forfeit his right to payment of any remaining installment payments and be obligated to repay the Company for the total amount of any installment payments previously paid prior to such termination. The recipient will be eligible to receive any scheduled installment payments under the plans in the event of a termination of employment prior to the vesting date that is without cause, as an eligible retirement or by reason of disability or death.  
   
  10. Related Party Transactions

The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Basic has adopted this pronouncement, which resulted in a reclassification of deferred debt costs related to long-term debt from an asset to an offset of the related liability. The adoption of the ASU did not affect our method of amortizing debt issuance costs, and will not affect the statement of operations.  
   In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The main provision of this Update is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. This Update is effective for Basic in annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted.  Basic has elected to adopt this ASU beginning in the interim period ended March 31, 2016, and retrospectively for all periods presented.  
    
  Not yet adopted 
  In August, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to assess a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
   
  Management s Overview  
  We provide a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, well servicing, fluid services and contract drilling. Our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land-based well services industry. Our acquisitions have increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence. In implementing our acquisition strategy, we made three business acquisitions during 2015.  These transactions, as well as market fluctuations, may make our revenues, expenses and income not directly comparable between periods. 
  Our total hydraulic horsepower ( hhp ) remained constant at 444,000 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased from 1,012 in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   962   in the   third   quarter of   2016  . Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs remained constant at 421 during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  Our operating revenues from each of our segments, and their relative percentages of our total revenues, consisted of the following (dollars in millions): 

During the fourth quarter of   2015  , oil prices declined to a level near $50 per barrel (WTI Cushing) and remained at or below that level during the nine-month period of   2016  .  During the first quarter of   2016  , oil prices declined further to a level below $30 per barrel (WTI Cushing) and increased somewhat, but remained below $50 per barrel throughout the   third   quarter. As a result, we have continued to see a significant negative impact on our customers  activity and the rates we are able to charge our customers.  Despite the   third  -quarter   2016   stabilization in oil prices, levels of customer capital expenditures, including maintenance and workover activities have not increased significantly as producers have not shown confidence in market conditions.  
  As a result of increased concentration of equipment and activity, utilization and pricing for our services has remained competitive in our oil-based operating areas. Natural gas prices have been depressed for a prolonged period and utilization and pricing for our services in our natural gas-based operating areas remained challenged during   2016  . 
  We believe that the most important performance measures for our business segments are as follows: 

Completion and Remedial Services     segment profits as a percent of revenues; 
                
    Well Servicing     rig hours, rig utilization rate, revenue per rig hour, profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues;  
                
    Fluid Services     trucking hours, revenue per truck, segment profits per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues; and 
                
    Contract Drilling     rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues. 
     Segment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs. These measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business. For a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company, see  Segment Overview  below. 
  Selected Acquisitions     and Divestitures 
  During   2015  , we made three business acquisitions that complemented our existing business segments, including:

     Table of Contents  

Grey Rock Pressure Pumping, LLC  
  On August 31, 2015, we acquired all of the assets of Grey Rock Pressure Pumping, LLC for total cash consideration of $10.2 million. This acquisition has been included in our completion and remedial services segment. 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we did not make any business acquisitions. 
  Recent Developments 
  On October 25, 2016, Basic and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with Basic, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions (the  Bankruptcy Petitions,  and the cases commenced thereby, the  Chapter 11 Cases ) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Court ) to pursue a balance sheet restructuring pursuant to a Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of the Debtors (as proposed, the  Prepackaged Plan ). The Debtor's Chapter 11 Case is being jointly administered under the caption   In re Basic Energy Services, Inc. et al.   (Case No. 16-12320). No trustee has been appointed, and the Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as  debtors in possession  under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. Basic expects to continue its operations without interruption during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. To assure ordinary course operations, the Court approved on an interim basis a variety of  first day  motions seeking various relief and authorizing the Debtors to maintain their operations in the ordinary course. The Debtors expect to receive approval of the "first day" motions on a final basis on or before November 18, 2016. 
   
  Segment Overview 
  Completion and Remedial Services 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our completion and remedial services segment represented approximately   32%   of our revenues. Revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are generally derived from a variety of services designed to complete and stimulate new oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores. Our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services, rental and fishing tool operations, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, cased-hole wireline services, snubbing and other services.   
  Our pumping services typically concentrate on providing mid-sized fracturing services in selected markets. Cementing and acidizing services also are included in our pumping services operations. Our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping operations was   444,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In this segment, we derive our revenues on a project-by-project basis in a competitive bidding process. Our bids are based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required, with the materials consumed billed separately. During this extended period of decreased spending by oil and gas companies, we have discounted our rates to remain competitive, which would cause lower segment profits. 
  The following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters in   2015  , the full year ended   December 31, 2015   and the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

The increase in completion and remedial services revenue to   $49.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $36.2 million   in the second quarter of   2016   resulted primarily from increased activity particularly in our coil tubing and fracing operations. Segment profits as a percentage of revenue increased to   18%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   9%   in second quarter of   2016   on the incremental effect of higher revenues and flat expenses and improved coil tubing utilization.

Fluid Services  
    
        During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our fluid services segment represented approximately   36%   of our revenues. Revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale, transportation, treatment, and recycling, storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling, production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Revenues also include well site construction and maintenance services. The fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by-product of the production of oil and natural gas. These services are necessary for our customers and usually have a stable demand but produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment. Fluid services for completion and workover projects require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud, circulating fluids or frac fluids used during a job, and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal. Because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales, trucking, storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects, the add-on services associated with drilling and workover activity generally enable us to generate higher segment profits. The higher segment profits for these add-on services are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services segment. Revenues from our water treatment and recycling services include the treatment, recycling and disposal of wastewater, including frac water and flowback, to reuse this water in the completion and production processes. Revenues from our well site construction services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations, installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines, constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities. We price fluid services by the job, by the hour, or by the quantities sold, disposed of or hauled. 
    
         The following is an analysis of our fluid services operations for each of the quarters in   2015  , the full year ended   December 31, 2015   and the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

Revenue per fluid service truck increased to   $49,000   in the third quarter of   2016   compared to   $47,000   in the second quarter of   2016   on higher disposal well utilization, and segment profit percentage increased to   17%   in the third quarter of 2016 from   15%   in the second quarter of   2016   primarily due to the incremental effect of higher revenues. 
  Well Servicing 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our well servicing segment represented   31%   of our revenues. Revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance, workover, completion, manufacturing and plugging and abandonment services. We provide maintenance-related services as part of the normal, periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells. Maintenance-related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business. Workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment, but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry. We also have a rig manufacturing and servicing facility that builds new workover rigs, performs large-scale refurbishments of used workover rigs and provides maintenance services on previously manufactured rigs. 
  We charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market conditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

the rig and the necessary personnel. Depending on the type of job, we may also charge by the project or by the day. We measure the activity levels of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a 55-hour work week per rig. Our fleet remained constant at a weighted average number of 421 rigs. 
  The following is an analysis of our well servicing operations for each of the quarters in   2015  , the full year ended   December 31, 2015   and the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):    

Rig utilization was   45%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up from   38%   in the second quarter of   2016  .  The higher utilization rate in the   third   quarter of   2016   resulted from an increase in well servicing hours and increases in activity in selected basins. Our segment profit percentage increased to   19%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   14%   in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased utilization and improved plugging and abandonment activity. 
  Contract Drilling 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our contract drilling segment represented approximately   1%   of our revenues. Revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells. 
  Within this segment, we charge our drilling rig customers a  daywork  daily rate, or  footage  at an established rate per number of feet drilled. We measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven-day work week per rig. Our contract drilling rig fleet had a weighted average of 12 rigs during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

The following is an analysis of our contract drilling segment for each of the quarters in   2015  , the full year ended   December 31, 2015   and the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):   

Revenue per day   increased   to   $20,100   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $16,100   in the second quarter of   2016  . The increase in drilling revenue per day in the   third   quarter of   2016   was due to an increase in rig trucking revenues and utilization. Segment profit percentage increased to   9%   in the second quarter of   2016   compared to segment profit of   6%   in the second quarter of   2016   due to increased utilization of our contract drilling trucking operations. 
   
  Operating Cost Overview 
  Our operating costs are comprised primarily of labor, including workers  compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance. The majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis. We also incur costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our fleet. These costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity.  Repair and maintenance is performed by our crews, company maintenance personnel and outside service providers. Compensation for our administrative personnel in local operating yards and in our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses. Insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs, trucks and other equipment in our fleet, employee payroll and safety record. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2.   Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations   of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For additional segment-related information and trends, please read  Segment Overview  above. 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   Revenues   decreased   by   25%   to   $141.6 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $189.2 million   during the same period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for our services by our customers compared to the same period in 2015, when our customers were still in the process of determining whether to reduce their capital budgets and ramp down projects. After the prolonged period of lower oil prices including the first half of 2016, our customers have curtailed projects and reduced capital budgets for new projects. 
  Completion and remedial services revenues   decreased   by   26%   to   $49.4 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $67.2 million   in the same period in   2015  . The decrease in revenue between these periods was primarily due to continued lower demand for completion related activities and our reduced pricing for our services, particularly in our pumping services

and coil tubing lines of business. Total hydraulic horsepower remained constant at   444,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Fluid services revenues   decreased   by   25%   to   $47.2 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $62.6 million   in the same period in   2015  , due to decreases in trucking hours and lower pricing for our services. Our revenue per fluid service truck decreased   21%   to   $49,000   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $62,000   in the same period in   2015   due mainly to decreases in pricing, disposal utilization and skim oil revenues. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased to   962   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   1,012   in the same period in   2015  .   
  Well servicing revenues   decreased   by   22%   to   $43.2 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $55.5 million   during the same period in   2015  . The decrease was driven by a decrease in utilization of our equipment, primarily due to declines in customer demand and pricing. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs remained constant at 421 during the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  .  Utilization was   45%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   50%   in the comparable quarter of   2015  . Revenue per rig hour in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $313  , decreasing from   $334   in the comparable quarter of   2015  , due to competitive rate pressures.  
  Contract drilling revenues decreased by   52%   to   $1.8 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $3.8 million   in the same period in   2015  . The number of rig operating days decreased   63%   to   92   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   252   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease in revenue and rig operating days was due to a decrease in drilling activity in the Permian Basin.   
  Direct Operating Expenses.   Direct operating expenses, which primarily consist of labor, including workers  compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance,   decreased   to   $116.3 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $154.9 million   in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to decreases in activity and corresponding reductions in employee headcount and wages to adapt to current activity levels.   
  Direct operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment   decreased   by   28%   to   $40.3 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $56.2 million   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to decreased activity levels overall, especially in our pumping and coil tubing services. Segment profits   increased   to   18%   of revenues during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   16%   for the same period in   2015  , due to the company's cost cutting measures throughout the year, including closing several negative cash-flow generating operations.   
  Direct operating expenses for the fluid services segment   decreased   by   18%   to   $39.3 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $47.7 million   for the same period in   2015  , mainly due to decreased activity levels. Segment profits were   17%   of revenues during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   24%   for the same period in   2015   due to the decline in trucking hours and lower skim oil sales and disposal activity. 
  Direct operating expenses for the well servicing segment   decreased   by   27%   to   $35.0 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $47.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in direct operating expenses corresponds to decreased workover and plugging activity levels. Segment profits   increased   to   19%   of revenues during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   14%   of revenues during the   third   quarter of   2015   due to the impact of the company's cost cutting measures throughout the year, including closing several negative cash-flow generating operations. 
  Direct operating expenses for the contract drilling segment   decreased     47%   to   $1.7 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $3.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , due to decreased activity and fewer rig operating days. Segment profits   decreased   to   9%   of revenues during the   third   quarter of   2016   from   17%   during the   third   quarter of   2015   due to a significant decline in drilling projects during the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by 16% to   $30.1 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $36.0 million   for the same period in   2015  , due to cost cutting measures implemented throughout the first half of 2016 including reduced headcount, salary reductions and lower incentive bonus expense. General and administrative expenses included $2.2 million and $3.3 million of stock-based compensation expense during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and Amortization     Expenses.   Depreciation and amortization expenses were   $53.1 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $60.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the decrease in capital expenditures for equipment during the first   nine   months of 2016. 
  Restructuring Costs.   Restructuring costs during the   third   quarter of   2016   were $10.5 million. These costs were incurred due to expenses related to preparation of our restructuring transactions and filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, including negotiation and entry into the Restructuring Support Agreement (the  RSA ) with 100% of the lenders under our Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and holders of over 80%  of Basic s 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ) and Basic s 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes,  and together with the 2019 Notes, the  Unsecured Notes ). See Note 1.   Basis of Presentation and Results of Operations   to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion on the RSA.

Goodwill Impairment and Bargain Purchase Gain.   In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash charge totaling $646,000 for impairment of all goodwill associated with acquisitions. We recorded $81.9 million of goodwill impairment for the same period in 2015. In the third quarter of 2016 we also recorded a $662,000 non-cash bargain purchase gain related to the GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC acquisition. 
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased to   $24.0 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $17.2 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015   due to additional interest related to our Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2016, as amended (the  Term Loan Agreement ).   
  Income Tax Expense.   There was no income tax benefit of during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to an income tax benefit of   $56.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . Our effective tax rate during the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   was approximately 0% and 35%, respectively.  The difference in the rate from 2015 to   2016   is due to the impact of deferred tax valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards available to be used in future periods. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For additional segment-related information and trends, please read  Segment Overview  above. 
  Revenues.   Revenues   decreased   by   39%   to   $392.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $644.6 million   during the same period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for our services by our customers compared to 2015, when our customers were still in the process of determining whether to reduce their capital budgets and ramp down projects. After the prolonged period of lower oil prices including the first three quarters of 2016, our customers have curtailed projects and reduced capital budgets for new projects. 
  Completion and remedial services revenues   decreased   by   50%   to   $125.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $249.1 million   in the same period in   2015  . The decrease in revenue between these periods was primarily due to decreased demand for completion related activities and pricing for our services, particularly in our pumping and coil tubing services lines of business. Additionally, we agreed to extend a $4.5 million credit to a customer as the result of an audit in the second quarter of 2015.  Total hydraulic horsepower remained constant at   444,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Fluid services revenues   decreased   by   29%   to   $142.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $200.1 million   in the same period in   2015  , due to decreases in trucking hours and lower pricing for our services. Our revenue per fluid service truck decreased   25%   to   $147,000   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $196,000   in the same period in   2015   due mainly to decreases in pricing for our services, disposal utilization and skim oil revenues. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks   decreased   to   974   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1,023   in the same period in   2015  .   
  Well servicing revenues   decreased   by   32%   to   $118.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $175.7 million   during the same period in   2015  . The decrease was driven by a decrease in rig hours, primarily due to declines in utilization and pricing for our services. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs   remained constant   at   421   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Utilization was   40%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   53%   in the comparable period of   2015  . Revenue per rig hour in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $314   decreasing from   $354   in the comparable period of   2015   due to competitive pricing pressures and lower levels of plugging and abandonment activity. 
  Contract drilling revenues   decreased   by   76%   to   $4.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.7 million   in the same period in   2015  . The number of rig operating days   decreased     77%   to   274   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1,206   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in revenue and rig operating days was due to a decrease in drilling activity in the Permian Basin.   
  Direct Operating Expenses.   Direct operating expenses, which primarily consist of labor, including workers  compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance,   decreased   to   $333.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $506.8 million   in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to decreases in activity and corresponding reductions in employee headcount and wages to adapt to current activity levels.   
  Direct operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment   decreased   by   45%   to   $107.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $195.1 million   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to decreased activity levels overall, especially in our pumping and coil tubing services. Segment profits   decreased   to   14%   of revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   22%   for the same period in   2015  , due to decreased completion-related activity, price competition and a $4.5 million credit given to a customer as the result of an audit in the second quarter of 2015.   
  Direct operating expenses for the fluid services segment   decreased   by   21%   to   $119.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $150.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , mainly due to decreased activity and pricing

levels. Segment profits were   17%   of revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   25%   for the same period in   2015   due to the decline in trucking hours and lower skim oil sales and disposal activity. 
  Direct operating expenses for the well servicing segment   decreased   by   31%   to   $101.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $147.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in direct operating expenses corresponds to decreased workover and plugging activity levels. Segment profits   decreased   to   15%   of revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   16%   of revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to decremental margins on lower revenues. 
  Direct operating expenses for the contract drilling segment   decreased     68%   to   $4.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , due to decreased activity and fewer rig operating days. Segment profits   decreased   to   4%   of revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   28%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to a significant decline in drilling projects in the Permian Basin. 
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by 22% to   $86.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $110.9 million   for the same period in   2015  , due to the effects of cost cutting measures implemented in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , including headcount reductions, salary reductions and lower incentive bonus expense. General and administrative expenses included $7.4 million and $10.5 million of stock-based compensation expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and Amortization     Expenses.   Depreciation and amortization expenses were   $164.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $181.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the decrease in capital expenditures for equipment during the first   nine   months of 2016. 
  Restructuring Costs.   Restructuring costs during the   third   quarter and for the nine-month period of   2016   were $10.5 million. These costs were incurred due to expenses related to preparation of our restructuring transactions and filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, including negotiation and entry into our RSA. See Note 1.   Basis of Presentation and Results of Operations   to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion on the RSA.  
  Goodwill Impairment and Bargain Purchase Gain.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a non-cash charge totaling $646,000 for impairment of all goodwill associated with acquisitions. We recorded $81.9 million of goodwill impairment for the same period in 2015. In the third quarter of 2016 we also recorded a $662,000 non-cash bargain purchase gain related to the GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC acquisition. 
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased to   $67.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $50.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to additional interest expense related to our Term Loan Agreement.   
  Income Tax Expense.   There was income tax benefit of   $3.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax benefit of   $101.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . Our effective tax rate during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately 1% and 35%, respectively. The difference in the rate from   2015   to   2016   is due to the impact of deferred tax valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards available to be used in future periods. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our primary capital resources were utilization of capital leases and borrowings under our Term Loan Agreement, partially offset by net cash used in operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $34.3 million   compared to   $46.7 million   as of December 31, 2015. An additional amount of   $28.7 million   is classified as restricted cash. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Basic had no borrowings and $51.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under its under its existing $250 million revolving credit facility (as so amended, the  Modified ABL Facility ), giving Basic $16.4 million of available borrowing capacity under the Modified ABL Facility based on its borrowing base determined as of such date, of which $15 million is subject to leverage covenants.  
  On February 17, 2016, the Company entered into the Term Loan Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders. For further discussion of the terms of the Term Loan Agreement, see Note 6.   Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense   to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan Agreement and the Modified ABL Facility, notwithstanding the various waivers and consents that we entered into during the third quarter of 2016, also described in Note 6. 
  We used   $71.8 million   in operations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to cash provided by operations of   $93.1 million   for the same period in 2015.  
  We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be from cash on hand, cash from operations and, now that the Court has approved an interim entry into a $90 million debtor-in-possession credit facility ( DIP Facility ), we expect to utilize borrowings thereunder during the pendency of our bankruptcy. Our secured term lenders and certain of our noteholders have committed to provide up to $90.0 million, in the form of the DIP Facility, of which, we received $30.0 million on October 26, 2016. 
  We are in active discussions with potential lenders to find a replacement for our Modified ABL Facility. For additional information about the planned restructuring, see Note 1.   Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations   to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash used by operating activities was   $71.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease compared to cash provided by operating activities of   $93.1 million   during the same period in 2015.  Operating cash flow usage in the first   nine   months of 2016 was due to an operating loss. 
  Our liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity depends upon industry conditions and financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. In the event that cash on hand and cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may have limited access to additional financing.  
    
  Capital Expenditures 
  Cash capital expenditures during the first   nine   months of 2016 were $22.9 million compared to $64.0 million in the same period of 2015. We added $5.2 million of additional assets through our capital lease program during the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to $13.7 million of additional assets in the same period in 2015.   
  We currently have planned capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 of under $40.0 million, including capital leases of $10.0 million. We do not budget acquisitions in the normal course of business, and we regularly engage in discussions related to potential acquisitions related to the oilfield services industry. 
  Capital Resources and Financing 
  Our ability to access additional sources of financing will be dependent on our operating cash flows and demand for our services, which could be negatively impacted due to the extreme volatility of commodity prices and declines in capital and debt markets. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time. 
   
  Other Matters 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Net Operating Losses 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately $520.0 million of net operating loss carryforwards. Transfers of our equity, or issuances of equity before or in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years. See Part II, Item 1A.   Risk Factors   for more information on possible impairments of our net operating loss carryforwards.

  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM  1.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  From time to time, we are a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that we consider probable or reasonably possible, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the risks factors set out below and the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, including under the section titled  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in Part I, you should carefully consider the information set forth in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a detailed discussion of known factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
    
  The Restructuring Support Agreement is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be beyond our control and may be difficult for us to satisfy. If the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Prepackaged Plan could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  The RSA sets forth certain conditions we must satisfy, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 proceeding, such as approval of a rights offering (the  Rights Offering ), which shall be open to participation by eligible holders of the 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes and backstopped by certain supporting holders of Unsecured Notes, confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan and effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond our control. The RSA gives the Requisite Noteholders (as defined therein) and the Requisite Term Loan Lenders (as defined therein) the ability to terminate the RSA under certain circumstances, including the failure of certain conditions to be satisfied. Termination of the RSA by any of the Requisite Noteholders or the Requisite Term Loan Lenders shall only be effective as to the applicable consenting class of creditors. A termination of the RSA may result in the loss of support for the Prepackaged Plan, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Prepackaged Plan. If the Prepackaged Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims as the Prepackaged Plan and our Chapter 11 proceedings could become protracted, which could significantly and detrimentally impact our relationships with vendors, suppliers, employees, and customers. 
    
  We will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings. 
    
  As a consequence of our filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our continuation as a going concern, will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following: 
     our ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate the Prepackaged Plan or another plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings;  
     the high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;  
     our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;  
     our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties;  
     our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;  
     our ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment; 
     the ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;  
     the ability of third parties to seek and obtain Court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;  
     the ability of third parties to seek and obtain Court approval to convert the Chapter 11 proceedings to chapter 7 proceedings; and  
     the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans. 
    
  Delays in our Chapter 11 proceedings increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process. 
    
   These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we need the prior approval of the Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

our Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans. 
    
  We may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan. 
    
  There can be no assurance that the Prepackaged Plan (or any other plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Court, so we urge caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities. 
    
  The success of any reorganization will depend on approval by the Court and the willingness of existing unsecured noteholders and term loan lenders to agree to the exchange or modification of their interests as outlined in the Prepackaged Plan, and there can be no guarantee of success with respect to the Prepackaged Plan or any other plan of reorganization. We might receive official objections to confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan from the various stakeholders in the Chapter 11 proceedings, including any official committees appointed. We cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on the Prepackaged Plan or on a Court's decision to confirm the Prepackaged Plan. Any objection may cause us to devote significant resources in response which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  If the Prepackaged Plan is not confirmed by the Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if any, distributions holders of claims against us, including holders of our secured and unsecured debt and equity, would ultimately receive with respect to their claims and interests. Once commenced, there can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from Chapter 11. If no plan of reorganization can be confirmed, or if the Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of holders of claims and interests, the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. 
    
  Upon emergence from bankruptcy, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance. 
  Our capital structure will be significantly altered under the Prepackaged Plan. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan (or any alternative plan of reorganization), our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization. 
    
  The pursuit of the Restructuring Support Agreement has consumed, and the Chapter 11 proceedings will continue to consume, a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition. 
    
  Although the Prepackaged Plan is designed to minimize the length of our Chapter 11 proceedings, it is impossible to predict with certainty the amount of time that we may spend in bankruptcy or to assure parties in interest that the Prepackaged Plan will be confirmed. The Chapter 11 proceedings will involve additional expense and our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the proceedings. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 proceedings are protracted. 
    
  During the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively, efficiently and safely conduct our business, and could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Trading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Under the Prepackaged Plan, the holders of our existing common stock will receive their pro rata share of 0.5% of our outstanding common stock following effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan, which interest will be further diluted to approximately 0.26%, on a pro forma basis, by the common shares issuable pursuant to the New Convertible Notes and subject to further dilution by the common shares issuable pursuant to the Warrants and management incentive plan contemplated in the Prepackaged Plan. 

35 

     Table of Contents  

The Prepackaged Plan, provides that our outstanding unsecured notes will be converted into common stock of the reorganized Company and that the holders of the existing common stock of the Company will receive their pro rata share of 0.5% of the common stock of the reorganized Company upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11. If the Prepackaged Plan is confirmed, the holders of the unsecured notes will also collectively receive subscription rights to acquire 9% PIK interest unsecured notes due 2019 in the aggregate principal amount as of $131,250,000 (the  New Convertible Notes ), mandatorily convertible into common stock within 36 months or sooner upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the contemplated procedures to the Rights Offering. Issuances of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) under the management incentive plan and conversion of the New Convertible Notes will dilute the voting power of the outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the trading price of such common stock. 
    
  Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors will change significantly. 
    
  Under the Prepackaged Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors will change significantly. Upon emergence, the Board will be made up of five directors.  Ascribe Capital LLC will designate one member, Silver Point Capital, L.P. will designate one member, the ad hoc group will designate two members and the remaining director will be the Chief Executive Officer of the reorganized Company. Accordingly, four of our five Board members are expected to be new to the Company. The new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past. 
    
  We are currently out of compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's minimum share price requirement and market capitalization requirement, and we are at risk of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which could materially impair the liquidity and value of our common stock. 
    
  Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. On August 19, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that (i) the average closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, which is the minimum average share price required by the NYSE and (ii) the average global market capitalization over a consecutive thirty trading-day period had fallen below $50 million at the same time our stockholders  equity was less than $50 million. We need to bring our share price and consecutive thirty trading-day average share price, as measured on the last trading day of any calendar month during the sixth month period following receipt of the NYSE notice, above $1.00 per share or the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. In addition, if our common stock price remains below the $1.00 threshold and falls to the point where the NYSE considers the stock price to be "abnormally low," the NYSE has the discretion to begin delisting procedures immediately. There is no formal definition of "abnormally low" in the NYSE rules but the NYSE has recently delisted shares where the price has fallen to $0.16 or less. We have submitted a plan to the NYSE that outlines the steps we plan to take to regain compliance with the market capitalization and stockholders  equity listing standard within eighteen months. 
    
  A delisting of our common stock, either as result of a failure to regain compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price requirement or the Company's failure to satisfy other qualitative or quantitative standards for continued listing on the NYSE, could reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock. 
    
  Transfers of our equity, or issuances of equity before or in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we had U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $520.0 million. Under federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $352.5 million as of December 31, 2015. While we expect a significant reduction in the amount of our net operating losses will occur as a result of the debt discharged as part of our Chapter 11 restructuring, we nonetheless expect to emerge from the Chapter 11 case with a portion of our net operating losses remaining. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an "ownership change", as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an "ownership change" if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation's common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change", the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future table income generally is subject to an annual limitation. If an "ownership" change occurs as part of a Chapter 11 proceeding, the section 382 limitation can be ameliorated.

The Court has approved, on an interim basis, restrictions on certain transfers of our stock to limit the risk of an "ownership change" prior to our restructuring in our Chapter 11 proceedings. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization, we anticipate that an "ownership change" will occur and our remaining net operating losses will be subject to annual limitation, which limitation can be ameliorated, however, under a favorable section 382 rule available in the context of a Chapter 11 proceeding. The court-approved restrictions on transfers of our equity are intended to prohibit transfers of our stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 case that could result in more severe limitations on our net operating losses under section 382.

ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
  The following table summarizes stock repurchase for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  :   

(1) On May 24, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had reauthorized the repurchase of up to approximately $35.2 million of shares of our common stock from time to time in open market or private transactions, at our discretion, as a continuation of our prior $50.0 million stock repurchase program announced in 2008 (of which $39.5 million was purchased prior to such reauthorization). The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
    
  (2) Except as indicated under the column  Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program,  the shares under  Total Number of Shares Purchased  were repurchased from various employees to provide such employees the cash amounts necessary to pay certain tax liabilities associated with the vesting of restricted shares owned by them. The shares were repurchased on various dates based on the closing price per share on the date of repurchase.

ITEM 3.       DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
    
  As previously disclosed in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 25, 2016, the filing of the voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company s obligations under the following debt instruments (the  Debt Instruments ): 

Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of February 17, 2016, as amended, by and among Basic, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent; 

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 26, 2014, as amended, by and among Basic, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer; 

Indenture dated as of February 15, 2011, as amended, among the Company, as issuer, the guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor trustee, which governs the 2019 Notes; and 

Indenture dated as of October 16, 2012, among the Company, as issuer, the guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor trustee, which governs the 2022 Notes.  
       
  The Debt Instruments provide that as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal and accrued interest due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations under the Debt Instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, and the holders  rights of enforcement in respect of the Debt Instruments are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Subject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims.
