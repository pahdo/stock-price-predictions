Note
1  Nature of Operations and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   

The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada, United States of America on April 9, 2014. The Company was formed for the purpose
of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The Company s year-end is April 30.  

Basis
of presentation    

  The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8
of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the
notes to the financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended April 30, 2016.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2017. For further information, these unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended April 30, 2016, included in the Company s report on Form 10-K  

Going
Concern   

  These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and will be able to
meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from
carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying
values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has
yet to achieve profitable operations, has accumulated losses of $119,248 and expects to incur further losses in the development
of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional
funds by equity financing and/or related party advances.  

Note
2  Mineral Property   

On
May 20, 2014, the Company entered into a property option agreement whereby NRC Exploration LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, was granted an option to earn up to a 100% interest in the Donald mineral property. The Donald mineral property is located
in the Omineca mining district of the Province of British Columbia Canada.  

In
May 2015, the underlying claims lapsed and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,150 during the year ended April 30, 2015,
resulting in the property being recorded at $Nil at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking
statements.  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believes,   project, 
 expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   strategy,   plan, 
 may,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely
result,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our
ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have
a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted
accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue
reliance should not be placed on such statements.  

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

We
are a mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada on April 9, 2014.  On May 8, 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned
subsidiary, NRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of mineral exploration. On May 20, 2014, our consulting
geologist introduced us to a mineral property and we acquired an option on that property whereupon we can acquire 100% legal and
beneficial ownership interest in a mineral claim known as the Donald mineral claim. The Donald mineral claim is located in the
Omineca Mining District located in the central part of the Province of British Columbia, Canada.  

In
view of the current world wide depressed market for metals, we have chosen not to incur additional exploration cost on the Donald
Property at this time and are no longer pursuing exploration or development of the property.  Management is currently searching
for other opportunities in the mineral exploration field.  

Results
of Operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016.   

For
the three months ended October 31, 2016 we did not earned any revenues. For the three months ended October 31, 2016 we incurred
expenses and a net loss in the amount of $12,157 (2015   $5,404). Our expenses during the quarter consisted of audit and
accounting fees of $2,000 (2015   $2,840), Office and miscellaneous expenses of $6,267 (2015   $806), legal fees of
$1,268 (2015   $812), transfer and filing fees of $1,290 (2015   $450) and interest expense of $1,332 (2015  
$496).  

Office
expenses increased during the period due to the hiring of an outside contractor to handle our office and administration work.
Our losses are attributable to operating expenses together with a lack of any revenues.  

For
the six months ended October 31, 2016 we did not earned any revenues. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 we incurred expenses
and a net loss in the amount of $32,235 (2015   $18,468). Our expenses during the six months ended October 31, 2016 consisted
of audit and accounting fees of $8,000 (2015   $10,335), Office and miscellaneous expenses of $12,371 (2015   $1,591),
legal fees of $3,923 (2015   $3,737), transfer and filing fees of $5,182 (2015   $1,925) and interest expense of $2,759
(2015   $880).  

Office
expenses increased during the period due to the hiring of an outside contractor to handle our office and administration work.
Our losses are attributable to operating expenses together with a lack of any revenues.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of October 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $6,249, consisting entirely of cash. We had current liabilities of $60,876.
 Accordingly, we had a working capital deficit of $54,627 as of October 31, 2016 (April 30, 2016 working capital deficit
of $23,575).  

To
date, we have funded our operations primarily through loans from Misael Aguirre, our former sole executive officer, and director
and from unrelated third parties. As of October 31, 2016, we owed Mr. Aguirre at total of $39,100 in principal, plus accrued interest
of $4,596. The amounts loaned by Mr. Aguirre earn interest at a rate of 6% per annum, are unsecured and are due on December 31,
2018. As of October 31, 2016, we owed an additional $48,978 in principal plus accrued interest of $1,576 to a third party ( Lender ).
The amounts loaned by the Lender earn interest at a rate of 6% per annum, are unsecured and payable on demand.   

We
do not currently have sufficient funds to repay our existing debts. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could
fail and investors may lose some or all of their investment. In addition, we are no longer pursuing exploration or development
of the Donald Property and are currently searching for other opportunities in the mineral exploration field. As such, we are unable
to provide an accurate estimate of our financial requirements for the next twelve months. If we do identify a suitable business
opportunity that we wish to pursue, we will likely need substantial financing. If we fail to obtain sufficient financing, our
ability to pursue alternative business opportunities may be limited. We do not currently have any financing arrangements in place,
and there is no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us when needed.  

Going
Concern   

As
discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we have no established source of revenue.  This has raised
substantial doubt for our auditors about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Without realization of additional capital,
it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern.  

Our
activities to date have been supported by equity financing.  Management continues to seek funding from its shareholders and
other qualified investors to pursue its business plan.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As
of October 31, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Currently, we do not believe that any accounting policies fit this definition.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

We
do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flow.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

A
smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of October 31, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Lei Yang. Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the six months ended October
31, 2016.  

Management
determined that the material weaknesses that resulted in controls being ineffective are primarily due to lack of resources and
number of employees. Material weaknesses exist in the segregation of duties required for effective controls and various reconciliation
and control procedures not regularly performed due to the lack of staff and resources.  

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily
prevent all fraud and material error.   Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
