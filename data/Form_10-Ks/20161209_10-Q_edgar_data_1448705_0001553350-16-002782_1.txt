  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN  
   
   (A) Organization   
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations. The interim results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. It is management's opinion, however that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. 
   
 On March 16, 2011 PayMeOn, Inc., a Nevada corporation organized on May 30, 2006 (the  Company ) completed its agreement and plan of merger (the  Merger Agreement ) to acquire Hyperlocal Marketing, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Hyperlocal ), pursuant to which Hyperlocal merged with and into HLM PayMeOn, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of PAYM. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Hyperlocal members received 301,296 shares of the Company common stock, which equals approximately 50.1% of the total shares of the Company issued and outstanding following the merger on a fully diluted basis. In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-45-15, the transaction is accounted for as a reverse acquisition. Hyperlocal is considered the accounting acquirer and the acquiree is PayMeOn since the members of Hyperlocal obtained voting and management control of PayMeon and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization. 
   
 Hyperlocal Marketing, LLC was originally organized in the State of Florida on January 22, 2010. The Company has focused its efforts on organizational activities, raising capital, software development and evaluating operational opportunities. 
   
 In 2014, the Company began selling Prodeco Technologies, LLC brand electric bicycles, an affiliate entity, of which the Company acquired a 19.4% equity interest (See note 13). During 2015, the Company expanded its sales of electric bicycles to include sales of electric bicycles and related products made by other manufacturers in a new retail store location in Fort Lauderdale. 
   
 During the first quarter of 2016, PayMeOn formed a new subsidiary, Paymeon Brands, Inc., to pursue the business of developing, marketing, managing and monetizing lifestyle brands and products. The Company intends to develop and leverage its relationships and expertise with respect to manufacturing processes, wholesale and retail distribution networks, and social influencer promotion, primarily targeting youth oriented  lifestyle  markets to create and grow new and existing brands across several market segments. 
   
 On April 19, 2016, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Paymeon Brands, Inc., entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Damion  D Roc  Butler to exclusively produce, manufacture and market certain intellectual property for certain trademarks held by Mr. Butler, including but not limited to,  Bad Boy Tour Merchandise,   Revolt,   Invisible Bully  and  Ciroc . The agreement provides for Paymeon Brands and Butler organizing a new entity equally owned by the parties. As of December 9, 2016 the parties have not formally reached an agreement.  
   
 PayMeOn Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries are herein referred to as the  Company .

PAYMEON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  

(B) Principles of Consolidation   
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayMeOn, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Hyperlocal Marketing, LLC, PayMeOn Brands, Inc, and HLM PayMeOn, Inc. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation. 
   
   (C) Going Concern   
   
 Since inception, the Company has incurred net operating losses and used cash in operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $10,376,111, a working capital deficiency of $1,847,215 and used cash in operations of $405,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for research and development and marketing of the Company's products which included the general and administrative expenses associated with its organization and product development. 
   
 These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   (A) Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash instruments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
   (B) Use of Estimates in Financial Statements   
   
 The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation of website costs, valuation of deferred tax asset, stock based compensation and any beneficial conversion features on convertible debt. 
   
   (C) Fair value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
   
 Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. 
   
 Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 
   
 Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information. 
   
 The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at air value in accordance with ASC Topic 820.

PAYMEON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  

Due to the short-term nature of all financial assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date. 
   
   (D) Prepaid expenses   
   
 On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into a business consulting and strategic planning agreement with Mayer and Associates. The Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock valued at $97,500 ($0.39 per share) the fair market value on the date of issuance and a one-time cash payment of $50,000 to consultant. The agreement is for a six month term and includes standard non-competition, non-solicitation and other covenants. On January 4, 2016 both parties agreed to extend the consulting agreement six months and the Company issued an additional 500,000 shares of common stock valued at $235,000 ($0.47 per share). On June 10, 2016, the Company entered into a legal services consulting agreement, whereby consultant agrees to provide legal review of certain retail agreements for the Company on an  as needed  basis. The Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock valued at $50,000 ($0.50 per share) the fair market value on the date of issuance. The agreement is for a twelve month term and includes standard non-competition, non-solicitation and other covenants. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Company has expensed $309,752 and $44,331 and has a prepaid expense of $74,590 and $103,169, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has other prepaid expenses of $882. 
   
   (E) Accounts Receivable   
   
 Accounts receivable are recorded at fair value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to repay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions. If market conditions decline, actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in decreased cash flows and increased bad debt expense.  
   
  (F)  Inventories   
   
 The Company s inventories consist entirely of purchased finished goods. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out basis. 
   
   (G) Computer Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Website Costs   
   
 Computer Equipment, Leasehold improvements and Website Costs are capitalized at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five years for all categories. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for betterments and renewals are capitalized. The cost of computer equipment and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts upon retirement or disposal with any resulting gain or loss being recorded in operations. 
   
 Software maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for enhanced functionality are capitalized. 
   
 The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50-15,  Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.  Costs incurred in the planning stage of a website are expensed as research and development while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized over the life of the asset, estimated to be three years.

PAYMEON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  

Computer equipment, leasehold improvements and website costs consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $16,220, $48,912, $188 and $562 respectively.  
   
 On October 22, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $300,000 to PDQ Auctions, LLC for leasehold improvements of the facilities subleased from PDQ Auctions, LLC. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 7% and is payable on or before October 22, 2017, unless the note is converted or prepaid prior to the maturity date. Subject to certain limitations below, the note may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment. In the event the Company issues any new or additional promissory notes that pay an interest rate that exceeds 7% per annum, then the holder shall be entitled to request an increase in the interest rate payable on the note to an amount equal to the rate being paid on the new or additional notes. The conversion of the note may be limited if, upon conversion, the holder thereof would beneficially own more than 4.9% of the Company s common stock. The note may be prepaid at the option of the Company commencing 190 days after the issuance of the note. 
   
   (H) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   
   
 The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.  
   
   (I) Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to customers, distributors and resellers when products that do not require further services or installation by the Company are shipped, when there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance and when collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with FASB ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition , as amended and interpreted. Cash received by the Company prior to shipment is recorded as deferred revenue. Sales are made to customers under terms allowing certain limited rights of return and other limited product and performance warranties for which provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements.  
   
 Amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are included in net sales. Costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of products sold.

(J) Investment   Equity Method   
   
 On July 18, 2014 the Company entered into and completed two membership interest purchase agreements to acquire a 19.4% equity interest in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, a private manufacturer of electric bicycles under the brand  Prodeco  with manufacturing facilities located in Oakland Park, Florida. Prodeco Technologies was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in June 2012. The Prodeco Technologies membership interests were acquired through the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of A Better Bike, LLC and EBikes, LLC, members of Prodeco Technologies, LLC. A Better Bike, LLC is owned by Vincent L. Celentano, the Company's largest individual shareholder. EBikes is owned by Vincent D. Celentano, II. In consideration of the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of A Better Bike and EBikes, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,941,176 restricted shares of its common stock to the members of A Better Bike and EBikes. For accounting purposes the transactions are recorded at the historical cost basis of $0 from the related parties. For financial statement purposes, the Company accounts for its investment in this affiliated entity under the equity method. The Company discontinued applying the equity method at September 30, 2016, as the investment is below $0 and will not resume applying the equity method until the affiliate reports income greater than its losses during the time period under equity method. 
   
 Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Company s proportionate share, based on present ownership interests, of: (a) the investee s profit or loss after the date of acquisition; (b) changes in the Company s equity that have not been recognized in the investee s profit or loss; and (c) certain other adjustments. The Company enjoys a close association with this affiliate through participation that allows for a significant amount of influence over the affiliates business decisions.  
   
   (K) Loss Per Share   
   
 The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The Company has 4,207,181 and 199,065 shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants and approximately 4 million and 2 million shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable that were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
   (L) Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 The Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. Under FASB ASC Topic. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. 
   
 Equity instruments issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

(M) Income Taxes   
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
   
   (N) Cost of Sales   
     
 Components of cost of sales include product costs and shipping costs to customers. 
   
   (O) Shipping and Handling Costs   
   
 The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue and shipping and handling costs to customers as cost of revenue. 
     
   (P) Reclassification   
   
 Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
   
   (Q) Segment information    
   
 In accordance with the provisions of ASC 280-10,   Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information  , the Company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company has two identifiable operating segments based on the activities of the company in accordance with the ASC 280-10. We had two operating segments at September 30, 2016, one that sells electric bicycles and related products made by other manufacturers in a retail store location in Fort Lauderdale and during the first quarter of 2016, PayMeOn formed a new subsidiary, Paymeon Brands, Inc., to pursue the business of developing, marketing, managing and monetizing lifestyle brands and products. The Company intends to leverage its relationships and expertise with respect to manufacturing processes, wholesale and retail distribution networks, and social influencer promotion, primarily targeting youth oriented  lifestyle  markets to create and grow new and existing brands across several market segments. 
   
  NOTE 3   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
 Revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $140,286 and $331,582, respectively and were derived from sales of electric bicycles made by multiple manufacturers, service, and lifestyle apparel sold through our Paymeon Brands subsidiary. Revenues through Paymeon Brands began during the second quarter of 2016. Revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, were $9,692 and $31,384, respectively and were primarily derived from the sale of electric bicycles made by Prodeco Technologies. The $130,594 and $300,198 increase represents an increase of 1,347% and 957% over the same periods in 2015 and reflects the continued growth of our light electric vehicle operations and the launch of our lifestyle brand apparel sales. We expect our revenues from light electric vehicles, and related products, such as branded lifestyle apparel, to increase as we continue to implement sales relationships. Sales of electric vehicles are seasonal, with higher sales typically higher during the year-end holiday season. Costs of operations also increase significantly from 2015 to 2016 as a direct result of our increase in sales. 
   
 Operating expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $337,019 and $2,191,678, respectively, reflecting an increase of $262,097 or 350% from $74,922 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and an increase of $1,897,212, or 644% from $294,466 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 The increases in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to the operations of our Paymeon Brands subsidiary and included increased general and administrative (G A) expenses of $84,626, increased consulting expenses of $107,443 primarily due to the issuance of common stock for services, increased travel and entertainment expenses of $20,166, increased professional fees of $15,913, and increased payroll and payroll taxes of $36,032 due to additional staff associated with the launch of our retail location dedicated to the sale of light electric vehicles and related products and services. 
   
 The increases in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended September 30, 2015 were primarily due to the reasons set forth above and included increased general and administrative (G A) expenses of $785,019, increased consulting expenses of $954,718 primarily due to the issuance of common stock for services, increased travel and entertainment expenses of $47,697, increased professional fees of $43,644, and increased payroll and payroll taxes of $93,468 due to additional staff associated with the launch of our retail location dedicated to the sale of light electric vehicles and related products and services. 

26 

Web development and hosting expenses were eliminated in 2016 as we have suspended development of our mobile application products. In addition, operating expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 includes non-cash expenses of $566,703 and $556,753 related to the issuance of stock options to employees and directors and warrants to consultants, respectively, during early 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 At December 31, 2015, we had $50,243 of cash and a working capital deficit of $1,355,156. At September 30, 2016, we had $24,651 of cash and a working capital deficit of $1,847,215. We require additional working capital. See  Plan of Operations  below. 
   
 Since inception, the Company has incurred net operating losses and used cash in operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $8,066,634. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $10,376,111. The Company has also dedicated substantial resources required to research and development and marketing of the Company s products which included the general and administrative expenses associated with its organization and product development. We expect operating losses to continue, due to the anticipated costs to develop retail light electric vehicle operations and marketing of branded apparel. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We require financing for our plan of operations. 
   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued a series of unsecured convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $359,500 to related parties. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7% and are payable on or before 12 months from the date of issuance, subject to extension. In addition, the notes may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company's common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.12 to $0.30 per share, subject to adjustment and subject to certain limitations on conversion. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued a series of unsecured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $63,975 to a related party. The notes bear interest at 7% and are payable on or before 12 months from the date of issuance. In addition, the notes may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.20 per share, subject to adjustment and limitations on conversion.  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,287,500 shares of restricted common stock to accredited investors for gross proceeds of $257,500 ($0.20 per share).  
   
 On July 13, 2016, HLM Paymeon, Inc., the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a merchant agreement with Summit Capital Partners ( SCP ), whereby it sold $40,500 of accounts receivable (the  Receipts Purchased Amount ) for a total purchase price of $30,000. HLM Paymeon shall repay $337 daily until the Receipts Purchased Amount is repaid. To secure HLM Paymeon s payment and performance obligations to SCP, HLM Paymeon has granted to SCP a security interest in all HLM Paymeon s accounts, chattel paper, documents, equipment, general intangibles, instruments and inventory. In addition, the Company s directors have individually guaranteed repayment of the Receipts Purchased Amount. 
   
 On August 17, 2016, PayMeOn Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a purchase order purchase and sale agreement with a third party, whereby PayMeOn Brands sold $50,000 of current purchase orders in exchange for $40,000. As a further inducement for Purchaser to enter into the agreement as collateral security for any and all obligations owing by PayMeOn Brands to Purchaser, PayMeOn Brands has granted to purchaser, as collateral security, a first lien security interest in all of PayMeOn Brands  accounts created as a result of Purchase Orders financed or purchased by purchaser and all inventory. 
   
 On September 2, 2016, Paymeon Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an purchase order purchase and sale agreement with a third party, whereby Paymeon Brands sold $20,000 of current purchase orders in exchange for $15,000.

 On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a short-term demand loan with a third party. The loan amount was $5,000 and requires repayment of $6,333in 30 days. 

27 

Current working capital is not sufficient to maintain our current operations and there is no assurance that future sales and marketing efforts will be successful enough to achieve the level of revenue sufficient to provide cash to sustain operations. To the extent such revenues and corresponding cash flows do not materialize, we will attempt to fund working capital requirements through third party financing, including a private placement of our securities. In the absence of revenues, we currently believe we require a minimum of $500,000 to maintain our current operations through the next 12 months and up to $750,000 to develop and expand our retail operations and Paymeon Brands operations. We cannot provide any assurances that required capital will be obtained or that the terms of such required capital may be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may reduce our operating activities until sufficient funding is secured or revenues are generated to support operating activities.  
   
  Subsequent Events  
   
 On October 7, 2016, legal representatives of Remrylie Licensing, Inc. asked one of the Company s retail customers to cease and desist from selling items related to Chistopher  Notorious BIG  Wallace's image on Paymeon Brands  behalf. Remrylie, owner of the exclusive right to market Notorious BIG's image, claimed that Paymeon Brands did not have the right to sell certain items it was selling through its retail customer. While we believe that the claims were without merit, we decided to cooperate and allow our retail customer to remove the items in question. On November 29, 2016 the Company and Remrylie Licensing, Inc., agreed to settle their dispute over royalty payments for sales of merchandise related to the estate of Notorious BIG. The Company agreed to pay $7,000 and the Parties mutually agreed to end the dispute and mutually indemnify each other. Paymeon does not expect to engage in any sales related to the estate of Notorious BIG in the future.

Plan of Operations  
   
 In October 2015, we launched a retail store located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In addition to Prodeco electric bicycles, we also sell electric bicycles made by other manufacturers, as well as other alternative transportation products (such as  hoverboards ) and related products and accessories at our retail location. We continue to own a minority interest in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, a private electric bicycle manufacturer located in Oakland Park, Florida. In March 2016, we formed a new subsidiary called Paymeon Brands, Inc. Paymeon Brands was formed to develop, market, manage and monetize lifestyle brands and products. The Company intends to leverage its relationships and expertise with manufacturing, wholesale and retail distribution, and social influencer promotion, primarily in youth oriented  lifestyle  markets to create and grow new and existing brands across products. Generally, Paymeon Brands intends to acquire exclusive and non-exclusive licensing rights to brands it believes are expandable to additional product lines. In addition, Paymeon Brands may develop or acquire its own products, which are not yet known  brands , but that it believes are in substantial growth markets and can become  lifestyle  oriented brands. During the early part of the second quarter of 2016, Paymeon Brands completed its  start-up  phase and began establishing retail partnerships for the commencement of the business. Paymeon Brands realized revenues from apparel sales during the second quarter. Paymeon Brands also began developing the  eChariot,  an electrically powered tricycle featuring comfortable seating and large, comfortable ride,  fat  tires. The eChariot was launched in October 2016 as a crowd-sourced project and surpassed its minimum goals towards the end of the quarter. We expect to begin developing    the eChariot during the first quarter of 2017, manufacturing will be done by a third party. We believe that future revenue to come from sales of apparel and related lifestyle brand accessories to large mass market retailers, smaller retail storefronts, retail websites, and social media platforms, as well as from sales of new products we develop or acquire. We have funded the start-up phase of the Paymeon Brands business with working capital from the issuance of convertible notes and equity to accredited investors and we believe that the business will require additional working capital investment of at least $250,000 during the remainder of 2016. We expect operating losses to continue, mainly due to the anticipated expenses associated with the marketing of all our products and continued development of our leased retail location for the sale and service of electric bicycles, hover boards and related products and accessories.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to customers, distributors and resellers when products that do not require further services or installation by the Company are shipped, when there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance and when collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with FASB ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition , as amended and interpreted. Cash received by the Company prior to shipment is recorded as deferred revenue. Sales are made to customers under terms allowing certain limited rights of return and other limited product and performance warranties for which provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements.  
   
 Amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are included in net sales. Costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of products sold. 
   
   Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 The Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock  Compensation. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. 
   
 Equity instruments issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505,  Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees . In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

  Risk Factors  
   
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, before deciding whether to invest in the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations or our financial condition.

  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   
 Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
               
  ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. 
   
 During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 management identified significant deficiencies related to (i) the U.S. GAAP expertise of our internal accounting staff, (ii) the ability of our internal accounting staff to record our transactions to which we are a party which necessitates our bringing in external consultants to supplement this function, and (iii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2016 based on the material weakness described below. The material weaknesses resulted in the delinquent filing of this report. 

insufficient systems for timely entering new inventory items and point of sales; 
   
 insufficient monitoring controls to determine the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting and related policies and procedures; 
   
 lack of competent financial management personnel with appropriate accounting knowledge and training; 
   
 our financial staff does not hold a license such as Certified Public Accountant in the U.S., nor have they attended U.S. institutions or extended educational programs that would provide enough of the relevant education relating to U.S. GAAP, nor have any U.S. GAAP audit experience; 
   
 we rely on an outside consultant to prepare our financial statements; and 
   
 insufficient controls over our period-end financial close and reporting processes. 
   
 As a result of this material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company s financial reporting. These material weaknesses also resulted in the delinquent filing of this report.  

30 

Because of its inherent limitations, however, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. In order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we engaged an outside accounting consultant to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity to U.S. GAAP. This outside accounting consultant has significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the engagement of this consultant will lessen the possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. We expect to continue to rely on this outside consulting arrangement to supplement our internal accounting staff for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we hire the proper internal accounting staff with the requisite U.S. GAAP experience, however, it is unlikely we will be able to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 We believe that the foregoing steps will remediate the material weaknesses identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NEITHER CLIENT, NOR ANY OTHER PERSON HEREAFTER BECOMING LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL EVER BE LIABLE FOR ANY OBLIGATION THAT MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS UNEARNED INTEREST THEREON OR SHALL EVER BE REQUIRED TO PAY ANY OBLIGATION THAT MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS INTEREST THEREON IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT MAY BE LAWFULLY CHARGED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW FROM TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT, AND THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL CONTROL OVER ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WHICH MAY BE IN CONFLICT THEREWITH. IF ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR OBLIGATION OWED BY CLIENT HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO BE IN EXCESS OF THE LEGAL MAXIMUM, OR PURCHASER SHALL OTHERWISE COLLECT MONEYS WHICH ARE DETERMINED TO CONSTITUTE INTEREST WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE INCREASE THE INTEREST ON ALL OR ANY PART OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS TO AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THAT PERMITTED TO BE CHARGED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, THEN ALL SUCH SUMS DETERMINED TO CONSTITUTE INTEREST IN EXCESS OF SUCH LEGAL LIMIT SHALL, WITHOUT PENALTY, BE PROMPTLY APPLIED TO REDUCE THE THEN OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OR, AT PURCHASER' OPTION, RETURNED TO CLIENT OR THE OTHER PAYOR THEREOF UPON SUCH DETERMINATION. IF       AT ANY TIME THE RATE AT WHICH INTEREST IS PAYABLE HEREUNDER EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM RATE, THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING HEREUNDER SHALL CEASE BEARING INTEREST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INTEREST ACCRUED HEREUNDER EQUALS (BUT DOES NOT EXCEED) THE MAXIMUM RATE APPLICABLE HERETO. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE TERM  APPLICABLE LAW  MEANS THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA OR, IF DIFFERENT, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OR TERRITORY IN WHICH THE CLIENT RESIDES, WHICHEVER LAW   

ALLOWS THE GREATER RATE OF INTEREST, AS SUCH LAWS NOW EXIST OR MAY BE CHANGED OR AMENDED OR COME INTO EFFECT IN THE FUTURE AND THE TERM  MAXIMUM RATE  MEANS THE MAXIMUM NONUSURIOUS RATE OF INTEREST THAT PURCHASER IS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO CONTRACT FOR, TAKE, CHARGE OR RECEIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE OBLIGATIONS.
