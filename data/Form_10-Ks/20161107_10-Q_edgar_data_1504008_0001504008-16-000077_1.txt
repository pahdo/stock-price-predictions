  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   - UNAUDITED 
  September 30, 2016 

Note 1    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  BankUnited, Inc. is a national bank holding company with   one   wholly-owned subsidiary, BankUnited, collectively, the Company. BankUnited, a national banking association headquartered in Miami Lakes, Florida, provides a full range of banking and related services to individual and corporate customers through   95   branches located in   15   Florida counties and   6   banking centers located in the New York metropolitan area at   September 30, 2016  . The Bank also offers certain commercial lending and deposit products through national platforms. 
  In connection with the FSB Acquisition, BankUnited entered into   two   loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The Loss Sharing Agreements consist of the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement. Assets covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements are referred to as covered assets or, in certain cases, covered loans. The Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement provides for FDIC loss sharing and the Bank s reimbursement for recoveries to the FDIC through May 21, 2019 for single family residential loans and OREO. Loss sharing under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement terminated on May 21, 2014. The Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement continues to provide for the Bank s reimbursement of recoveries to the FDIC through May 21, 2017 for all other covered assets, including commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loans, certain investment securities and commercial OREO. Gains realized on the sale of formerly covered investment securities are included in recoveries subject to reimbursement. Pursuant to the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, the covered assets are subject to a stated loss threshold whereby the FDIC will reimburse BankUnited for   80%   of losses related to the covered assets up to   $4.0 billion   and   95%   of losses in excess of this amount, beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred.  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in BKU s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods.  
  Certain amounts presented for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Accounting Estimates 
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
  Significant estimates include the ALLL, the amount and timing of expected cash flows from covered assets and the FDIC indemnification asset, and the fair values of investment securities and other financial instruments. Management has used information provided by third party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair values of investment securities. 
  Loan Servicing Assets 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company made an irrevocable election to subsequently measure residential MSRs at fair value. Previously, residential MSRs were subsequently measured using the amortization method. This change had no impact on opening retained earnings at January 1, 2016. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments in this update affect any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets unless those contracts, including leases and insurance contracts, are within the scope of other standards. The amendments establish a core principle requiring the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   - UNAUDITED

amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The amendments also require expanded disclosures concerning the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Financial instruments and lease contracts are generally outside the scope of the ASU. The FASB has issued subsequent ASUs to clarify certain aspects of ASU 2014-09, without changing the core principle of the guidance and to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual periods and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. While management does not currently expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, management has not completed its evaluation of the impact of adoption of this ASU.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments in the ASU that are expected to be most applicable to the Company 1) require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, 2) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, and 3) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Although management has not completed its evaluation of the impact of adoption of this ASU, adoption is not expected to have any impact on financial position or cash flows. Equity investments for which fair value changes will be recognized in earnings upon adoption totaled   $74 million   at   September 30, 2016   and had unrealized gains of   $7.5 million  .    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The amendments in this ASU require a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for lease terms longer than one year. Accounting for leases by a lessor will not be significantly impacted by this ASU. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Management has not yet made an evaluation of the impact of adoption of this ASU. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):     Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.   The amendments in this ASU clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. A company performing the assessment under these amendments is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with a four-step decision sequence, without consideration of whether the contingency is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. While management does not currently expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, management has not completed its evaluation of the impact of adoption of this ASU. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The amendments provide, among other items, that a) excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, as opposed to additional paid-in-capital; b) excess tax benefits and deficiencies be classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; and c) an entity may make an entity-wide election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is currently finalizing its evaluation of the impact of this ASU on the financial statements and related disclosures, including the alternative methods of adoption. The adoption is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  . The ASU introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The ASU also modifies the impairment model for available for sale securities. The ASU introduces the CECL model which applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes loans, loan commitments and held-to-maturity debt securities. The CECL model requires an entity to estimate credit losses expected over the life of an exposure, considering historical, current and forecast information. The ASU amends the current OTTI model for debt securities and requires an estimate of expected credit losses only when the fair value of an available for sale debt security is below its amortized cost. Credit losses on available for sale debt securities will be limited to the difference

between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. The ASU also provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with more than insignificant credit deterioration since their origination. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Management has not yet made an evaluation of the impact of adoption of this ASU. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments in this ASU provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues where there has been diversity in practice. The guidance in the ASU that is expected to be most applicable to the Company requires: (1) cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs to be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, (2) proceeds from settlement of insurance claims to be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss and (3) cash proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies to be classified as cash flows from investing activities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated cash flows.

As discussed above, OTTI was recognized on   two   positions in one private label commercial MBS during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   No   securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Other than as noted above, the Company does not intend to sell securities that are in significant unrealized loss positions and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost

basis, which may be at maturity. At   September 30, 2016  ,   34   securities were in unrealized loss positions. The amount of impairment related to   11   of these securities was considered insignificant, totaling approximately   $101 thousand   and no further analysis with respect to these securities was considered necessary. The basis for concluding that impairment of the remaining securities was not other-than-temporary is further described below:  
  U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise residential     MBS     and commercial MBS 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   four   U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise residential MBS and   one   U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise commercial MBS were in unrealized loss positions. The substantial majority of the securities had been in unrealized loss positions for less than twelve months and the amount of impairment was less than   1%   of amortized cost. The timely payment of principal and interest on these securities is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Given the generally limited severity and duration of impairment and the expectation of timely payment of principal and interest, the impairments were considered to be temporary. 
  Private label residential     MBS     and     CMOs 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   three   private label residential MBS were in unrealized loss positions. The amount of impairment of each of the individual securities was less than   2%   of amortized cost. These securities were assessed for OTTI using credit and prepayment behavioral models that incorporate CUSIP level constant default rates, voluntary prepayment rates and loss severity and delinquency assumptions. The results of these assessments were not indicative of credit losses that would result in the Company recovering less than its amortized cost basis related to any of these securities as of   September 30, 2016  . Given the limited severity of impairment and the expectation of timely recovery of outstanding principal, the impairments were considered to be temporary. 
  Private label commercial     MBS  : 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   five   private label commercial MBS were in unrealized loss positions. The amount of impairment of each of the individual securities was less than   1%   of amortized cost. The unrealized losses were primarily attributable to widening credit spreads since the purchase of the securities. These securities were assessed for OTTI using credit and prepayment behavioral models incorporating assumptions consistent with the collateral characteristics of each security. The results of this analysis were not indicative of expected credit losses. Each of the securities has greater than 30% current credit enhancement. Given the expectation of timely recovery of outstanding principal, the impairments were considered to be temporary. 
  Single family rental real estate-backed securities: 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   five   single family rental real estate-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. The unrealized losses were primarily due to widening credit spreads since the purchase of the securities, leading to increased extension risk. The amount of impairment of each of the individual securities was   1%   or less of amortized cost. Management's analysis of the credit characteristics, including loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios, and levels of subordination for each of the securities is not indicative of projected credit losses. Given the limited severity of impairment and the absence of projected credit losses, the impairments were considered to be temporary. 
  Collateralized loan obligations: 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   three   collateralized loan obligations were in unrealized loss positions, due to widening credit spreads subsequent to acquisition. The amount of impairment of each of the individual securities was less than   1%   of amortized cost. Given the limited severity of impairment, levels of subordination and the results of independent analyses of the credit quality of loans underlying the securities, the impairments were considered to be temporary. 
  SBA securities:  
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   two   SBA securities were in unrealized loss positions. The majority of impairment related to one security and was less than   3%   of amortized cost. This security was purchased at a premium and the impairment was attributable primarily to increased prepayment speeds. The timely payment of principal and interest on these securities is guaranteed by this U.S. Government agency. Given the limited severity of impairment and the expectation of timely payment of principal and interest, the impairments were considered to be temporary.

Through two subsidiaries, the Bank provides commercial and municipal equipment and franchise financing utilizing both loan and lease structures. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the commercial lending subsidiaries portfolio included a net investment in direct financing leases of   $626 million   and   $472 million  , respectively.  
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company purchased 1-4 single family residential loans totaling   $355 million  ,   $937 million  ,   $243 million   and   $678 million  , respectively.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had pledged real estate loans with UPB of approximately   $9.2 billion   and recorded investment of approximately   $8.4 billion   as security for FHLB advances. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the UPB of ACI loans was   $1.6 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively. The accretable yield on ACI loans represents the amount by which undiscounted expected future cash flows exceed recorded investment.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the methodology for calculation of the ALLL was changed to extend the loss experience period used to calculate historical average net charge-off rates from 12 quarters to 16 quarters for commercial and consumer loans. We believe this extension of the look back period is appropriate at this time to capture a sufficient range of observations reflecting the performance of our loans, most of which were originated in the current economic cycle, and to reflect recent indications that the U.S. economy continues to move through the credit cycle. Extending the look back period to 16 quarters resulted in an increase in the ALLL of approximately   $9 million   as of March 31, 2016, as compared to using a 12-quarter look back period at the same date.

Credit quality information    
  New and non-ACI loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Commercial relationships on non-accrual status with committed balances greater than or equal to   $1.0 million   that have internal risk ratings of substandard or doubtful, as well as loans that have been modified in TDRs, are individually evaluated for impairment. The likelihood of loss related to loans assigned internal risk ratings of substandard or doubtful is considered elevated due to their identified credit weaknesses. Factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include payment status, financial condition of the borrower, collateral value, and other factors impacting the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.

__________________________________________ 
   There were   no   new and non-ACI loans contractually delinquent by 90 days or more and still accruing at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The amount of additional interest income that would have been recognized on non-accrual loans had they performed in accordance with their contractual terms was approximately   $1.1 million   and   $2.3 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  Management considers delinquency status to be the most meaningful indicator of the credit quality of 1-4 single family residential, home equity and consumer loans. Delinquency statistics are updated at least monthly. See "Aging of loans" below for more information on the delinquency status of loans. Original LTV and original FICO score are also important indicators of credit quality for the new 1-4 single family residential portfolio.  
  Internal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for commercial loans. Internal risk ratings are a key factor in identifying loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and impact management s estimates of loss factors used in determining the amount of the ALLL. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis. Generally, relationships with balances in excess of defined thresholds, ranging from   $1 million   to   $3 million  , are re-evaluated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. Loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment capacity of the borrower are categorized as special mention. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses, including payment defaults, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, inadequate cash flow, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, past due real estate taxes or exhausted interest reserves, are assigned an internal risk rating of substandard. A loan with a weakness so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors has not been charged off, will be assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful.

  Note 5    FDIC Indemnification Asset 
  When the Company recognizes gains or losses related to covered assets in its consolidated financial statements, changes in the estimated amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements with respect to those gains or losses are also reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Covered loans may be resolved through prepayment, short sale of the underlying collateral, foreclosure, sale of the loans or charge-off. For loans resolved through prepayment, short sale or foreclosure, the difference between consideration received in satisfaction of the loans and the carrying value of the loans is recognized in the consolidated statement of income line item    Income from resolution of covered assets, net  .  Losses from the resolution of covered loans increase the amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Gains from the resolution of covered loans reduce the amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Similarly, differences in proceeds received on the sale of covered OREO and covered loans and their carrying amounts result in gains or losses and reduce or increase the amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Increases in valuation allowances or impairment charges related to covered assets also increase the amount estimated to be recoverable from the FDIC. These additions to or reductions in amounts recoverable from the FDIC related to transactions in the covered assets are recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item    Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification    and reflected as corresponding increases or decreases in the FDIC indemnification asset. 
  In addition, recoveries of previously indemnified losses on commercial loans and gains on the sale of investment securities that were previously covered under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement result in reimbursements due to the FDIC. These transactions are included in the tables below. Amounts payable to the FDIC resulting from these transactions are recognized in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  The following tables summarize the components of the gains and losses associated with covered assets, along with the related additions to or reductions in the amounts recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements, as reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in thousands):

Note 6      Income Taxes 
  A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to the Company s effective income tax rate for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   follows: 

A discrete income tax benefit of   $49.3 million   was recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The tax benefit, predicated on clarifying guidance issued by the IRS in 2015, relates to the Company's ability to claim additional tax basis in certain assets acquired in the FSB Acquisition. The additional tax basis will result in increased taxable losses or reduced taxable income upon the final disposition of those assets. 
  The Company has a liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain state income tax positions in several jurisdictions. The Company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by   $5.9 million  , net of federal income tax benefit, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits was increased by   $16.7 million   and   $8.1 million  , net of federal income tax benefit, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to uncertain income tax positions taken on certain amended and recently filed state income tax returns.  
  The Company has investments in affordable housing limited partnerships which generate federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tax benefits. The balance of these investments, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, was   $72 million   and   $59 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Unfunded commitments for affordable housing investments, included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, were   $56 million   and   $52 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with these limited partnerships at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $74 million  . While the Company believes the likelihood of potential losses from these investments is remote, the maximum exposure was determined by assuming a scenario where the projects completely fail and do not meet certain government compliance requirements resulting in recapture of the related tax credits. These investments did not have a significant impact on income tax expense for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Note 7    Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk related to liabilities that expose the Company to variability in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. The Company enters into LIBOR-based interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of limiting the variability of interest payment cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate LIBOR. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments is reported in AOCI and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects earnings. 
  The Company also enters into interest rate derivative contracts with certain of its commercial borrowers to enable those borrowers to manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate interest rate risk associated with these derivative contracts, the Company enters into offsetting derivative contract positions with primary dealers. These interest rate derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments; therefore, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized

immediately in earnings. The impact on earnings related to changes in fair value of these derivatives for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was not material. 
  The Company may be exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its interest rate derivative agreements. The Company assesses the credit risk of its financial institution counterparties by monitoring publicly available credit rating and financial information. The Company manages dealer credit risk by entering into interest rate derivatives only with primary and highly rated counterparties, the use of ISDA master agreements and counterparty limits. The agreements contain bilateral collateral arrangements with the amount of collateral to be posted generally governed by the settlement value of outstanding swaps. The Company manages the risk of default by its borrower counterparties through its normal loan underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures. The Company does not currently anticipate any losses from failure of interest rate derivative counterparties to honor their obligations. 
  The following tables set forth certain information concerning the Company s interest rate contract derivative financial instruments and related hedged items at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of loss reclassified from AOCI into interest expense (effective portion) was   $3.7 million  ,   $13.1 million  ,   $7.0 million   and   $20.1 million  , respectively.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   derivative positions designated as cash flow hedges were discontinued and   none   of the gains and losses reported in AOCI were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges or because of the early extinguishment of debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of loss expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the next twelve months was   $11.3 million  .  
  Some of the Company s ISDA master agreements with financial institution counterparties contain provisions that permit either counterparty to terminate the agreements and require settlement in the event that regulatory capital ratios fall below certain designated thresholds, upon the initiation of other defined regulatory actions or upon suspension or withdrawal of the Bank s credit rating. Currently, there are no circumstances that would trigger these provisions of the agreements.

The difference between the amounts reported for interest rate swaps subject to master netting agreements and the total fair value of interest rate contract derivative financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets is related to interest rate contracts entered into with borrowers not subject to master netting agreements. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had pledged investment securities available for sale with a carrying amount of   $80 million   and cash on deposit of   $93 million   as collateral for interest rate swaps in a liability position.   No   financial collateral was pledged by counterparties to the Company for interest rate swaps in an asset position. The amount of collateral required to be posted varies based on the settlement value of outstanding swaps and in some cases may include initial margin requirements.

The shares granted were valued at the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, ranging from   $29.78   to   $33.76  , and had an aggregate fair value of   $20.0 million  . The total unrecognized compensation cost of   $23.6 million   for all unvested share awards outstanding at   September 30, 2016   will be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of   1.87 years  .  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company granted   621,283   unvested share awards under the 2010 Plan and   41,645   unvested share awards under the 2014 Plan. All of the shares vest in equal annual installments over a period of   three years   from the date of grant. The shares granted were valued at the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, ranging from   $31.35   to   $36.50  , and had an aggregate fair value of   $21.2 million  . 
  Executive share-based awards 
  Two of the Company's executives are eligible to receive annual awards of RSUs and PSUs (collectively, the "share units"). RSUs represent a fixed number of shares and vest in equal tranches over 3 years. PSUs are initially granted based on a target value. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest at the end of a three-year performance measurement period will be based on the

achievement of performance criteria pre-established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Upon vesting, the share units will be converted to common stock on a one-for-one basis, or may be settled in cash at the Company's option. The share units will accumulate dividends declared on the Company's common stock from the date of grant to be paid subsequent to vesting. During the     nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,     57,873     RSUs and     57,873     PSUs were granted. The RSUs were valued at the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant of     $29.85  . The performance criteria established for the PSUs granted in 2016 include both performance and market conditions. The grant-date value of the PSUs was   determined   based on     the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and a discount related to the market condition, considering the     probability   of meeting the defined performance conditions. 
  Certain other of the Company's executives are eligible to receive unvested share awards at the end of one-year performance periods. The dollar value of share awards to be granted is based on the achievement of performance criteria pre-established annually by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares of common stock to be awarded is variable based on the closing price of the Company's stock on the date of grant; therefore, these awards are initially classified as liability instruments in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and compensation cost is recognized from the beginning of the performance period. The share awards vest in equal installments over a period of   three years   from the date of grant. 
  Compensation cost related to pe  rformance based executive share-based awards is recognized during the performance period based on the probable outcome of the respective performance conditions. The total unrecognized compensation cost of   $3.9 million   for these executive share-based awards at   September 30, 2016   will be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of   2.62 years  . 
   
  Note 10    Fair Value Measurements 
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  
  Following is a description of the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which those measurements are typically classified. 
  Investment securities available for sale   Fair value measurements are based on quoted prices in active markets when available; these measurements are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. These securities typically include U.S. Treasury securities and certain preferred stocks. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, quoted prices of identical securities in less active markets, discounted cash flow techniques, or matrix pricing models. These securities are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and include U.S. Government agency securities, U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise MBS, preferred stock investments for which level 1 valuations are not available, corporate debt securities, non-mortgage asset-backed securities, single family rental real estate-backed securities, certain private label residential MBS and CMOs, Re-Remics, private label commercial MBS, collateralized loan obligations and state and municipal obligations. Pricing of these securities is generally primarily spread driven. Observable inputs that may impact the valuation of these securities include benchmark yield curves, credit spreads, reported trades, dealer quotes, bids, issuer spreads, current rating, historical constant prepayment rates, historical voluntary prepayment rates, structural and waterfall features of individual securities, published collateral data, and for certain securities, historical constant default rates and default severities. Investment securities available for sale generally classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include certain private label MBS and trust preferred securities. The Company typically values these securities using third-party proprietary pricing models, primarily discounted cash flow valuation techniques, which incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that may impact the valuation of these securities include risk adjusted discount rates, projected prepayment rates, projected default rates and projected loss severity. 
  The Company uses third-party pricing services in determining fair value measurements for investment securities. To obtain an understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used, management reviews written documentation provided by the pricing services, conducts interviews with valuation desk personnel and reviews model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary. Management has established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by the treasury front office of all prices provided on a monthly basis. Any price evidencing unexpected month over month fluctuations or deviations from expectations is challenged. If considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies, a price will be obtained from an additional independent valuation source. The Company does not typically adjust the prices provided, other than through this established challenge process. The results of price challenges are subject to review by executive management. The Company has also established a quarterly process whereby prices provided by its primary pricing service for

a sample of securities are validated. Any price discrepancies are resolved based on careful consideration of the assumptions and inputs employed by each of the pricing sources. 
  Servicing rights   Commercial servicing rights are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating contractually specified servicing fees and market based assumptions about prepayments, discount rates, default rates and costs of servicing. Prepayment and default assumptions are based on historical industry data for loans with similar characteristics. Assumptions about costs of servicing are based on market convention. Discount rates are based on rates of return implied by observed trades of underlying loans in the secondary market. Fair value of residential MSRs is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates market based assumptions including estimated prepayment speeds, contractual servicing fees, cost to service, discount rates, escrow account earnings, ancillary income, and estimated defaults.   Due to the nature of the valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing, servicing rights are classified as level 3  .  
  Derivative financial instruments   Interest rate swaps are predominantly traded in over-the-counter markets and, as such, values are determined using widely accepted discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These discounted cash flow models use projections of future cash payments and receipts that are discounted at mid-market rates. Observable inputs that may impact the valuation of these instruments include LIBOR swap rates and LIBOR forward yield curves. These fair value measurements are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The balance of servicing rights at the beginning of 2016 includes   $8.5 million   of residential MSRs, which the Company elected to measure at fair value effective January 1, 2016. Changes in the fair value of servicing rights are included in the consolidated statement of income line item    Other non-interest income  .  Changes in fair value include changes due to discount rates and valuation assumptions, as well as other changes such as runoffs and the passage of time. The amount of unrealized losses included in earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that were related to servicing assets held at   September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   $1.7 million   and were primarily due to changes in discount rates and valuation assumptions. 
  Securities for which fair value measurements are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   consisted of pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of   $4 million   and private label residential MBS and CMOs with a fair value of   $127 million  . The trust preferred securities are not material to the Company s financial statements. Private label residential MBS consisted of senior and mezzanine tranches collateralized by prime fixed rate and hybrid 1-4 single family residential mortgages originated before 2005, some of which contain option-arm features. Substantially all of these securities have variable rate coupons. Weighted average subordination levels at   September 30, 2016   were   16.9%  ,   12.9%   and   1.6%   for investment grade, non-investment grade and option-arm securities, respectively. There were   $28 million   of option-arm securities with a subordination level of zero at   September 30, 2016  .

The following table provides information about the valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in the valuation of private label residential MBS and CMOs falling within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):  

The significant unobservable inputs impacting the fair value measurement of private label residential MBS and CMOs include voluntary prepayment rates, probability of default, loss severity given default and discount rates. Generally, increases in probability of default, loss severity or discount rates would result in a lower fair value measurement. Alternatively, decreases in probability of default, loss severity or discount rates would result in a higher fair value measurement. For securities with less favorable credit characteristics, decreases in voluntary prepayment speeds may be interpreted as a deterioration in the overall credit quality of the underlying collateral and as such, lead to lower fair value measurements. The fair value measurements of those securities with higher levels of subordination will be less sensitive to changes in these unobservable inputs other than discount rates, while securities with lower levels of subordination will show a higher degree of sensitivity to changes in these unobservable inputs other than discount rates. Generally, a change in the assumption used for probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for loss severity given default and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for voluntary prepayment rate.  
  The following table provides information about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of servicing rights as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

Increases in prepayment rates or discount rates would result in lower fair value measurements and decreases in prepayment rates or discount rates would result in higher fair value measurements.   Although the prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they generally move in opposite directions. 
    Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
  Following is a description of the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which those measurements are typically classified.

Impaired loans, OREO     and other repossessed assets   - The carrying amount of collateral dependent impaired loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, which may be real estate or other business assets, less estimated costs to sell. The carrying value of OREO is initially measured based on the fair value of the real estate acquired in foreclosure and subsequently adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. Fair values of real estate collateral are typically based on real estate appraisals which utilize market and income approaches to valuation incorporating both observable and unobservable inputs. When current appraisals are not available, the Company may use brokers  price opinions, home price indices or other available information about changes in real estate market conditions to adjust the latest appraised value available. These adjustments to appraised values may be subjective and involve significant management judgment. The fair value of repossessed assets or collateral consisting of other business assets is generally based on appraisals that use market approaches to valuation incorporating primarily unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements related to collateral dependent impaired loans, OREO and other repossessed assets are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following tables present the carrying value of assets for which non-recurring changes in fair value have been recorded for the periods indicated (in thousands):

The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which those measurements are classified at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):    

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments, other than those described above: 
  The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable. 
  Investment securities held to maturity 
  Investment securities held to maturity includes one bond issued by the State of Israel, with fair value obtained from a third party pricing service.  
  Non-marketable equity securities 
  Non-marketable equity securities include FHLB and FRB stock. There is no market for these securities, which can be liquidated only by redemption by the issuer. These securities are valued at par, which has historically represented the redemption price and is therefore considered to approximate fair value.  
  Loans held for sale 
  The fair value of the portion of small business loans guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies being held for sale is estimated using pricing on recent sales of similar loans by the Company in active markets.

ACI and non-ACI loans 
  Fair values are estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Estimates of future cash flows incorporate various factors that may include the type of loan and related collateral, estimated collateral values, estimated default probability and loss severity given default, internal risk rating, whether the interest rate is fixed or variable, term of loan and whether or not the loan is amortizing. The fair values of loans accounted for in pools are estimated on a pool basis. Other loans may be grouped based on risk characteristics and fair value estimated in the aggregate when applying discounted cash flow valuation techniques. Discount rates for residential loans are based on observable fixed income market data for products with similar credit characteristics. Discount rates for commercial loans reflect indicative yields based on pricing obtained in the commercial loan sale in 2014, adjusted for changes in market rates subsequent to the sale.  
  New loans 
  Fair values of residential loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis with discount rates based on yields at which similar loans are trading in the secondary market, which reflect assumptions about credit risk. Fair values of commercial and consumer loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis with discount rates based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The ALLL related to commercial and consumer loans is considered a reasonable estimate of the required adjustment to fair value to reflect the impact of credit risk. This estimate may not represent an exit value as defined in ASC 820. 
  FDIC indemnification asset 
  The fair value of the FDIC indemnification asset has been estimated using a discounted cash flow technique incorporating assumptions about the timing and amount of future projected cash payments from the FDIC related to the resolution of covered assets. The factors that impact estimates of future cash flows are similar to those impacting estimated cash flows from covered loans. The discount rate is determined by adjusting the risk free rate to incorporate uncertainty in the estimate of the timing and amount of future cash flows and illiquidity. 
  Deposits 
  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique based on rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
  FHLB     advances 
  Fair value is estimated by discounting contractual future cash flows using the current rate at which borrowings with similar terms and remaining maturities could be obtained by the Company. 
  Senior notes 
  Fair value is estimated based on quoted prices of identical securities in less active markets. 
   
  Note 11     Commitments and Contingencies    
  The Company issues off-balance sheet financial instruments to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to fund loans, unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit, and commercial and standby letters of credit. These commitments expose the Company to varying degrees of credit and market risk which are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers, and are subject to the same credit policies used in underwriting loans. Collateral may be obtained based on the Company s credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Company s maximum exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. Unfunded commitments under lines of credit include   $13.5 million   available under non-cancellable commitments in effect at the date of the FSB Acquisition, which are covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement if prescribed conditions are met.

Commitments to fund loans 
  These are agreements to lend funds to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund loans generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded and, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements.  
  Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 
  Unfunded commitments under lines of credit include commercial, commercial real estate, home equity and consumer lines of credit to existing customers. Some of these commitments may mature without being fully funded.  
  Commercial and standby letters of credit 
  Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These letters of credit are primarily issued to support trade transactions or guarantee arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.  
  Total lending related commitments outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands):  

Legal Proceedings 
  The Company has accrued approximately   $2.8 million   related to a recent jury award in an action brought against Herald National Bank, which action was commenced prior to the Company's acquisition by Herald. Although management does not believe the findings of the jury amount to violations of the New York Labor Code, it is reasonably possible the judge may conclude otherwise, which would result in the jury award being doubled. In such event, the judge would also have the discretion to award plaintiff s their reasonable attorney s fees. The Company is strongly considering appealing the final judgment once entered. 
  The Company is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon advice of legal counsel, the likelihood is remote that the impact of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  Overview 
  Quarterly Highlights 
  In evaluating our financial performance, we consider the level of and trends in net interest income, the net interest margin, levels and composition of non-interest income and non-interest expense, performance ratios such as the return on average assets and return on average equity and asset quality ratios, particularly for the non-covered portfolio, including the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, non-performing assets to total assets, and portfolio delinquency and charge-off trends. We consider growth in the loan and deposit portfolios by region and product type, trends in funding mix and cost of funds. We analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions. 
  Performance highlights include: 
              
    Earnings for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 benefited from a discrete income tax benefit of   $49.3 million  . Non-interest expense for these periods included $1.3 million in professional fees related to this tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this discrete income tax benefit and related professional fees, net income for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $53.8 million   and   $146.9 million  , respectively, or   $0.50   and   $1.37   per diluted share. 
                 
    The provision for loan losses increased to   $24.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from   $17.8 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The most significant factors contributing to this increase were an increase in qualitative reserves and an increase in reserves related to the taxi medallion portfolio. 
     
   43 

     Table of Contents  

Total interest earning assets increased by   $1.0 billion   during the third quarter of 2016. New loans and leases, including equipment under operating lease, grew by   $0.9 billion   during the quarter. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , new loans and leases increased by   $2.6 billion  . 
                
    At   September 30, 2016  ,   97.4%   of the new commercial loan portfolio was rated "pass" and substantially all of the new residential portfolio was current. The ratio of non-performing, non-covered loans to total non-covered loans was   0.61%   and the ratio of non-covered non-performing assets to total assets was   0.43%   at   September 30, 2016  . Non-performing taxi medallion loans comprised 0.30% of total non-covered loans at September 30, 2016. 
                 
    The Company s capital ratios exceeded all regulatory  well capitalized  guidelines, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of   8.5%  , CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of   11.6%   and a Total risk-based capital ratio of   12.4%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Results of Operations 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings. Net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources, movements in market interest rates, levels of non-performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors. 
  The mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand, market and competitive conditions in our primary lending markets and by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets. The mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by management's assessment of the desire for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in the Company's markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds. 
  Net interest income is also impacted by the accounting for ACI loans acquired in conjunction with the FSB Acquisition. ACI loans were initially recorded at fair value, measured based on the present value of expected cash flows. The excess of expected cash flows over carrying value, known as accretable yield, is recognized as interest income over the lives of the underlying loans. The positive impact of accretion related to ACI loans on the net interest margin and the interest rate spread is expected to continue to decline as ACI loans comprise a declining percentage of total loans. The proportion of total loans represented by ACI loans is declining as the ACI loans are resolved and new loans are added to the portfolio. ACI loans represented   3.3%   and 5.3% of total loans, including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs, at   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. As this trend continues, we expect our net interest margin and interest rate spread to continue to decrease, although at a declining rate. 
  The impact of ACI loan accounting on net interest income makes it difficult to compare our net interest margin and interest rate spread to those reported by other financial institutions.

     Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015 
  Net interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was   $230.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $194.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $36.5 million  . The increase in net interest income was comprised of an increase in tax-equivalent interest income of   $49.8 million  , offset by an increase in interest expense of   $13.3 million  . 
  The increase in tax-equivalent interest income was comprised primarily of a   $39.2 million   increase in interest income from loans and a   $10.3 million   increase in interest income from investment securities. 
  Increased interest income from loans was attributable to a   $3.8 billion   increase in the average balance outstanding partially offset by a   0.24%   decrease in the tax-equivalent yield to   5.03%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   5.27%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Offsetting factors contributing to the overall decline in the yield on loans included: 
             
    New loans originated at lower market rates of interest comprised a greater percentage of the portfolio for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   than for   2015  . New loans represented   96.0%   of the average balance of loans outstanding for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   93.4%   for the   three months ended September

30, 2015  . We expect the impact of growth of the new loan portfolio to lead to further declines in the overall yield on loans.  
              
    Tax-equivalent interest income on loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition totaled   $76.2 million   and   $74.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The tax-equivalent yield on those loans increased to   40.69%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   30.75%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in the yield on loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition resulted primarily from improvements in expected cash flows for ACI loans.  
     The average balance of investment securities increased by   $1.1 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from the comparable period in   2015   while the tax-equivalent yield increased to   2.87%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   2.65%   for   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in tax-equivalent yield reflects (i) changes in portfolio composition, including growth in the municipal portfolio, (ii) resetting of rates on floating-rate securities following the FRB's interest rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 and (iii) net purchases of securities with wider spreads. 
  The components of the increase in interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   were a   $7.0 million   increase in interest expense on deposits, a   $1.3 million   increase in interest expense on FHLB advances and a   $5.0 million   increase in interest expense on notes and other borrowings.  
  The most significant factor contributing to the increase in interest expense on deposits was an increase of   $2.5 billion   in average interest bearing deposits. The average cost of interest bearing deposits increased to   0.80%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.74%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase reflected increases in the cost of interest bearing demand deposits and in savings and money market deposits of   0.17%   and   0.06%  , respectively. These increases were generally driven by growth of deposits in competitive markets. 
  The increase in interest expense on FHLB advances was driven by an increase in the average balance of   $1.3 billion  , partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on these borrowings. The average rate paid on FHLB advances decreased to   0.92%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   1.09%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in interest expense on notes and other borrowings was the result of the issuance of $400 million in senior notes in November 2015.  
  The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.69%   as compared to   3.88%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The interest rate spread decreased to   3.53%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.74%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The declines in net interest margin and interest rate spread resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and the cost of the senior notes, as discussed above. We expect the net interest margin and interest rate spread to continue to decline, although at a decreasing rate, as new loans originated at lower current market rates of interest continue to grow and higher yielding loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition are collected or resolved. 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was   $667.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $556.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $110.6 million  . The increase in net interest income was comprised of an increase in tax-equivalent interest income of   $153.2 million  , offset by an increase in interest expense of   $42.6 million  . 
  The increase in tax-equivalent interest income was comprised primarily of a   $122.3 million   increase in interest income from loans and a   $29.4 million   increase in interest income from investment securities. 
  Increased interest income from loans was attributable to a   $3.9 billion   increase in the average balance outstanding partially offset by a   0.28%   decrease in the tax-equivalent yield to   5.14%  for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   5.42%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  The average balance of investment securities increased by   $920 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the comparable period in   2015   while the tax-equivalent yield increased to   2.82%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   2.54%   for   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  The components of the increase in interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were a   $20.6 million   increase in interest expense on deposits, a   $7.0 million   increase in

     Table of Contents  

interest expense on FHLB advances and a   $15.0 million   increase in interest expense on notes and other borrowings, reflecting the senior notes issued in November 2015.  
  The most significant factor contributing to the increase in interest expense on deposits was an increase of   $2.8 billion   in average interest bearing deposits. The average cost of interest bearing deposits increased by   0.04%   to   0.78%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   0.74%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase reflected increases in the cost of interest bearing demand deposits and in savings and money market deposits of 0.15% and   0.07%  , respectively.   
  The increase in interest expense on FHLB advances was driven by an increase in the average balance of   $1.1 billion  , partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on these borrowings. The average rate paid on FHLB advances decreased by   0.05%   to   1.02%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   1.07%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   3.75%   as compared to   3.95%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The interest rate spread decreased to   3.60%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   3.81%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Factors contributing to these changes in yields, costs, the net interest margin and the interest rate spread were consistent with those for the three month periods discussed above. 
  Provision for Loan Losses 
  The provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that, in management s judgment, is appropriate under GAAP. The determination of the amount of the ALLL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Our determination of the amount of the allowance and corresponding provision for loan losses considers ongoing evaluations of the credit quality of and level of credit risk inherent in various segments of the loan portfolio and of individually significant credits, levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs, historical and statistical trends and economic and other relevant factors. See  Analysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  below for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the allowance. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded provisions for loan losses of   $24.9 million   and   $16.7 million  , respectively, related to new loans. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded provisions for loan losses of   $43.6 million   and   $33.7 million  , respectively, related to new loans. The amount of the provision is impacted by loan growth, portfolio mix, historical loss rates, the level of charge-offs and specific reserves for impaired loans, and management's evaluation of qualitative factors in the determination of general reserves.  
  The most significant factors contributing to the increase in the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were an increase in qualitative reserves and an increase in reserves related to the taxi medallion portfolio. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in reserves related to the taxi medallion portfolio. See the section entitled "Analysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" below for further discussion.  
  An ALLL is established related to ACI loans when quarterly evaluations of expected cash flows indicate it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all of the cash flows expected at acquisition plus any additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition. An allowance for non-ACI loans is established if factors considered relevant by management indicate that additional losses have arisen on non-ACI loans subsequent to the FSB Acquisition. 
  As discussed below in the section entitled "Non-interest income," the impact on our results of operations of any provision for (recovery of) loan losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by the corresponding impact on the FDIC indemnification asset, recorded in non-interest income.  
  Non-Interest Income 
  The Company reported non-interest income of   $25.1 million   and   $31.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Non-interest income was   $77.1 million   and   $73.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Although the amounts have declined in amount and as a percent of total non-interest income, a significant portion of our non-interest income has historically related to transactions in the covered assets. We have broken out the significant categories of non-interest income that relate to covered assets in the table below, to assist in the comparison of the amount and composition of our non-interest income with that of other financial institutions.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents a comparison of the categories of non-interest income for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Non-interest income related to transactions in the     covered assets    
  The consolidated financial statements reflect the impact of gains or losses arising from transactions in the covered assets. The balance of the FDIC indemnification asset is reduced or increased as a result of decreases or increases in cash flows expected to be received from the FDIC related to these gains or losses. When these transaction gains or losses are recorded, we also record an offsetting amount in the consolidated statement of income line item    Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification  .  This line item includes the significantly mitigating impact of FDIC indemnification related to the following types of transactions in covered assets: 
             
    gains or losses from the resolution of covered assets; 
                
    provisions for (recoveries of) losses on covered loans; 
                
    gains or losses on the sale of covered loans; and 
                
    gains or losses on covered OREO. 
     Each of these types of transactions is discussed further below. 
  Covered loans may be resolved through prepayment, short sale of the underlying collateral, foreclosure, sale of the loans or charge-off. For loans resolved through prepayment, short sale or foreclosure, the difference between consideration received in resolution of the loans and the carrying value of the loans is recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item    Income from resolution of covered assets, net  .  Both gains and losses on individual resolutions are included in this line item. Losses from the resolution of covered loans increase the amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Gains from the resolution of covered loans reduce the amount recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements. These additions to or reductions in amounts recoverable from the FDIC related to the resolution of covered loans are recorded in non-interest income in the line item    Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification    and reflected as corresponding increases or decreases in the FDIC indemnification asset. The amount of income or loss recorded in any period will be impacted by the amount of covered loans resolved, the amount of consideration received, and our ability to accurately project cash flows from ACI loans in future periods.

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides further detail of the components of income from resolution of covered assets, net, for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

The decrease in income for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   resulted primarily from decreases in income from residential paid in full resolutions. In addition, there was a decrease in recoveries on commercial loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  The decreases in income from payments in full for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   reflected decreases in the number of resolutions and in average income per resolution. Average income per resolution declined in part due to updated cash flow forecasts, reflecting additional history with the performance of covered loans driving continued decreases in non-accretable difference.  
  Under the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement with the FDIC, the Bank may sell up to 2.5% of the covered loans based on UPB at the date of the FSB Acquisition, or approximately $280 million, on an annual basis without prior consent of the FDIC. Any losses incurred from such loan sales are covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. Any loan sale in excess of this stipulated annual threshold requires approval from the FDIC to be eligible for loss share coverage. However, if the Bank seeks to sell covered loans in excess of the 2.5% threshold in the nine months prior to the stated termination date of loss share coverage (May 21, 2019 for covered residential loans) and the FDIC refuses to consent, the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement will be extended for two additional years with respect to the loans requested to be included in such sales. The Bank will then have the right to sell all or any portion of such loans without FDIC consent at any time within the nine months prior to the extended termination date, and any losses incurred will be covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. This final sale mechanism, if exercised, ensures no residual credit risk in our covered loan portfolio that would otherwise arise from credit losses occurring after the termination date of the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. 
  The following table summarizes the impact of the sale of covered loans for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Pricing received on the sale of covered loans may vary based on (i) market conditions, including the interest rate environment, the amount of capital seeking investment and the secondary supply of loans with a particular performance history or collateral type, (ii) the type and quality of collateral, (iii) the performance history of loans included in the sale and (iv) whether or not the loans have been modified. The decline in results of these sales for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from the comparable periods in   2015   related primarily to the characteristics of the loans sold and the dynamics of secondary market demand for these assets. We anticipate that we will continue to exercise our right to sell covered loans on a quarterly basis in the future. 
  Additional impairment arising since the FSB Acquisition related to covered loans is recorded in earnings through the provision for losses on covered loans. Under the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, the Company is entitled to recover from the FDIC a portion of losses on these loans; therefore, the discounted amount of additional expected cash flows from the FDIC related to these losses is recorded in non-interest income in the line item    Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification    and reflected as a corresponding increase in the FDIC indemnification asset. Alternatively, a recovery of the provision for loan losses related to covered loans results in a reduction in the amounts the Company expects to recover from the FDIC and a  
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  

corresponding reduction in the FDIC indemnification asset and in non-interest income, reflected in the line item    Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification  .  
  The Company records impairment charges related to declines in the net realizable value of OREO properties subject to the Loss Sharing Agreements and recognizes additional gains or losses upon the eventual sale of such OREO properties. These amounts are included in other non-interest expense in the consolidated financial statements. The estimated increase or reduction in amounts recoverable from the FDIC with respect to these gains and losses is reflected as an increase or decrease in the FDIC indemnification asset and in non-interest income in the line item "  Net gain (loss) on FDIC indemnification  ." 
  The following tables summarize the components of the gains and losses associated with covered assets, along with the related additions to or reductions in the amounts recoverable from the FDIC under the Loss Sharing Agreements, as reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Transaction income (loss) includes recoveries of   $15 thousand  ,   $143 thousand   and   $66 thousand  , respectively, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and a provision of   $35 thousand   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   related to unfunded loan commitments included in other non-interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  
     Other components of non-interest income 
  The increase in gain on sale of non-covered loans for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in   2015   related primarily to increased gains of   $5.0 million   on sales of loans by SBF. SBF was acquired by the Company in May 2015. 
  Gains on investment securities available for sale for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 related to sales of securities in the normal course of managing liquidity, portfolio duration and yield. 
  Income from lease financing amounted to   $11.2 million   and   $32.8 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $12.7 million   and   $26.0 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 included $3.9 million in gains on sale of leased equipment; such gains were not significant for the quarter and nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Increased rental  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

revenue corresponding to growth in the operating lease portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 more than offset the decrease in gains on sale of equipment.  
  Non-Interest Expense 
  The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Annualized non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets was   2.2%   and   2.4%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   2.3%   and   2.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Excluding amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset, annualized non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets was   1.6%   and   1.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   1.7%   and   1.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The more significant changes in the components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 
  Employee compensation and benefits 
  As is typical for financial institutions, employee compensation and benefits represents the single largest component of recurring non-interest expense. Employee compensation and benefits for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $0.2 million   and increased by   $9.7 million  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily reflected general increases in compensation, including the impact of annual pay raises. 
  Amortization of FDIC indemnification asset    
  Amortization of FDIC indemnification asset   totaled   $39.0 million   and   $116.7 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $28.4 million   and   $76.9 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The FDIC indemnification asset was initially recorded at its estimated fair value of $3.4 billion, representing the present value of estimated future cash payments from the FDIC for probable losses on covered assets. As projected cash flows from the ACI loans have increased, the yield on the loans has increased accordingly and the estimated future cash payments from the FDIC have decreased. This change in estimated cash flows is recognized prospectively, consistent with the recognition of the increased cash flows from the ACI loans. As a result, the FDIC indemnification asset is being amortized to the amount of the estimated future cash flows. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average rate at which the FDIC indemnification asset was amortized was   25.36%   and   23.48%  , respectively, compared to   13.49%   and   11.52%  , respectively, during the comparable periods in   2015  .  
  The rate of amortization will increase if estimated future cash payments from the FDIC decrease. The amount of amortization is impacted by both the change in the amortization rate and the decrease in the average balance of the indemnification asset. As we continue to submit claims under the Loss Sharing Agreements and recognize periodic amortization, the balance of the indemnification asset will continue to decline. 
  See   Note 5   to the consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of the FDIC indemnification asset for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Subsequent to the termination of loss sharing under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement in 2014, the entire balance of the FDIC indemnification asset relates to residential loans  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  

and OREO covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. The following table presents the carrying value of the FDIC indemnification asset and the estimated future cash flows at the dates indicated (in thousands): 

The amount of expected amortization reflects the impact of improvements in cash flows expected to be collected from the covered loans, as well as the impact of time value resulting from the discounting of the asset when it was initially established. This amount will be amortized to non-interest expense using the effective interest method over the period during which cash flows from the FDIC are expected to be collected, which is limited to the lesser of the contractual term of the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and the expected remaining life of the indemnified assets.  
  Deposit insurance expense 
  Deposit insurance expense increased by   $1.3 million   and   $3.2 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases primarily reflect the growth of the balance sheet and, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the large bank surcharge imposed by the FDIC. 
  Depreciation of equipment under operating lease 
  Depreciation of equipment under operating lease increased by   $1.8 million   and   $7.5 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . These increases are consistent with the growth of the portfolio of equipment under operating lease. 
  Other non-interest expense 
  The most significant components of other non-interest expense are advertising and promotion, costs related to lending activities and deposit generation, insurance, travel and general office expense. Non-interest expense for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted by an increase in litigation accruals of $2.1 million and a $1.1 million settlement related to a payroll tax audit. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company's effective tax rate was   31.7%   and   33.2%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   (46.1)%   and   7.6%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Components included in the reconciliation of the Company's effective income tax rate to the statutory federal tax rate of 35.0% included the effect of state income taxes and the impact of income not subject to federal tax for each of the periods presented. The effective income tax rate for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   also reflects a discrete income tax benefit of $49.3 million. The tax benefit, predicated on guidance issued by the IRS in 2015, relates to the Company's ability to claim additional tax basis in certain assets acquired in the FSB Acquisition. In addition, $5.9 million of reserves for uncertain tax liabilities were released in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to the lapse of the statute of limitations related thereto.  
   
  Analysis of Financial Condition 
  Average interest-earning assets increased   $4.9 billion   to   $23.7 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $18.8 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was driven by a   $3.9 billion   increase in the average balance of outstanding loans and a   $920 million   increase in the average balance of investment securities. The increase in average loans reflected growth of   $4.1 billion   in average new loans outstanding, partially offset by a   $234 million   decrease in the average balance of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition. Average non-interest earning assets remained relatively consistent period over period, reflecting a decrease in the FDIC indemnification asset and offsetting increases in equipment under operating lease, net and other assets. Growth of the new loan and lease portfolio, resolution of covered loans and declines in the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset are trends that are expected to continue. 
  Average interest bearing liabilities increased   $4.3 billion   to   $19.8 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $15.6 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to an increase of   $2.8 billion   in average interest bearing

     Table of Contents  

deposits, a   $1.1 billion   increase in average FHLB advances and a   $392 million   increase in average notes and other borrowings. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased by   $246 million  . 
  Average stockholders' equity increased by   $180 million  , due primarily to the retention of earnings. 
  Investment Securities Available for Sale 
  The following table shows the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale as of the dates indicated (in thousands): 

Our investment strategy has focused on providing liquidity necessary for day-to-day operations, adding a suitable balance of high credit quality, diversifying assets to the consolidated balance sheet, managing interest rate risk, and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters. We have sought to maintain liquidity by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities including U.S. Treasury securities, SBA securities and U.S. Government agency MBS. Investment grade municipal securities provide liquidity along with higher tax-equivalent yields at longer durations than the portfolio in general. We have also invested in highly rated structured products that, while somewhat less liquid, provide us with attractive yields. Relatively short effective portfolio duration helps mitigate interest rate risk arising from the currently low level of market interest rates. The weighted average expected life of the investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   was   4.9   years and the effective duration was   1.5   years.  
  Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were approved in December 2013. Among other provisions, the regulations generally serve to prohibit us from holding an ownership interest in a covered fund, as such terms are defined in the regulations. There are Re-Remic securities in our portfolio that we believe are likely to be deemed impermissible investments under the regulations. At   September 30, 2016  , we held Re-Remics with a carrying value of   $50 million  , the substantial majority of which were in unrealized gain positions. The Re-Remics are an amortizing portfolio and we estimate that their carrying value will be significantly reduced through normal amortization and prepayments prior to the required compliance date. We must be in compliance with the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule by July 2017 as it pertains to legacy covered funds, as defined.

The following table shows the scheduled maturities, carrying values and current yields for investment securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . Scheduled maturities have been adjusted for anticipated prepayments of MBS and other pass through securities. Yields on tax-exempt securities have been calculated on a tax-equivalent basis (dollars in thousands): 

The available for sale investment securities portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of   $147 million   at   September 30, 2016   with aggregate fair value equal to   102.5%   of amortized cost. Net unrealized gains included   $152 million   of gross unrealized gains and   $5 million   of gross unrealized losses. Investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   had an aggregate fair value of   $906 million  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   91.1%   of investment securities available for sale were backed by the U.S. Government, U.S. Government agencies or sponsored enterprises or were rated AAA or AA, based on the most recent third-party ratings. Investment securities available for sale totaling   $78 million   were rated below investment grade or not rated at   September 30, 2016  , all of which were acquired in the FSB Acquisition and in unrealized gain positions at   September 30, 2016  .  
  We evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether any of the investments in unrealized loss positions are other-than-temporarily impaired. This evaluation considers, but is not necessarily limited to, the following factors, the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security: 
             
    our intent to hold the security until maturity or for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; 
                
    whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis; 
                
    the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than amortized cost; 
                
    adverse changes in expected cash flows; 
                
    collateral values and performance; 
                
    the payment structure of the security, including levels of subordination or over-collateralization; 
                
    changes in the economic or regulatory environment; 
                
    the general market condition of the geographic area or industry of the issuer; 
                
    the issuer s financial condition, performance and business prospects; and

     The Company recognized OTTI in the amount of   $463 thousand   on two positions in one private label commercial MBS security, which was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This security was in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and the Company intended to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. No securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2015  , or during the   three and nine   months then ended.  
  We do not intend to sell any other securities in significant unrealized loss positions at   September 30, 2016  . Based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis. The severity of impairment of individual securities in the portfolio is generally not material. Unrealized losses in the portfolio at   September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to widening credit spreads and, for certain securities, increased extension risk. 
  The timely repayment of principal and interest on U.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise securities in unrealized loss positions is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Management performed projected cash flow analyses of the private label residential MBS and CMOs and private label commercial MBS in unrealized loss positions, incorporating CUSIP level assumptions consistent with the collateral characteristics of each security including collateral default rate, voluntary prepayment rate, severity and delinquency assumptions. Based on the results of this analysis, no credit losses were projected. Management's analysis of the credit characteristics of individual securities and the underlying collateral and levels of subordination for each of the single family rental real estate-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations in unrealized loss positions is not indicative of projected credit losses.  
  For further discussion of our analysis of investment securities for OTTI, see   Note 3   to the consolidated financial statements. 
  We use third-party pricing services to assist us in estimating the fair value of investment securities. We perform a variety of procedures to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used by the pricing services including obtaining and reviewing written documentation of the methods and assumptions employed, conducting interviews with valuation desk personnel and reviewing model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary. Our classification of prices within the fair value hierarchy is based on an evaluation of the nature of the significant assumptions impacting the valuation of each type of security in the portfolio. We have established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by our treasury front office of all prices provided on a monthly basis. Any price evidencing unexpected month over month fluctuations or deviations from our expectations based on recent observed trading activity and other information available in the marketplace that would impact the value of the security is challenged. Responses to the price challenges, which generally include specific information about inputs and assumptions incorporated in the valuation and their sources, are reviewed in detail. If considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies, a price will be obtained from an additional independent valuation specialist. We do not typically adjust the prices provided, other than through this established challenge process. Our primary pricing services utilize observable inputs when available, and employ unobservable inputs and proprietary models only when observable inputs are not available. As a matter of course, the services validate prices by comparison to recent trading activity whenever such activity exists. Quotes obtained from the pricing services are typically non-binding. 
  We have also established a quarterly price validation process to assess the propriety of the pricing methodologies utilized by our primary pricing services by independently verifying the prices of a sample of securities in the portfolio. Sample sizes vary based on the type of security being priced, with higher sample sizes applied to more difficult to value security types. Verification procedures may consist of obtaining prices from an additional outside source or internal modeling, generally based on Intex. We have established acceptable percentage deviations from the price provided by the initial pricing source. If deviations fall outside the established parameters, we will obtain and evaluate more detailed information about the assumptions and inputs used by each pricing source or, if considered necessary, employ an additional valuation specialist to price the security in question. Pricing issues identified through this evaluation are addressed with the applicable pricing service and methodologies or inputs are revised as determined necessary, Depending on the results of the validation process, sample sizes may be extended for particular classes of securities. Results of the validation process are reviewed by the treasury front office and by senior management. 
  The majority of our investment securities are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury securities and certain preferred stocks are classified within level 1 of the hierarchy. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   2.2%   and 3.0%, respectively, of our investment securities were classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Securities classified within level 3 of the hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   included certain private label residential MBS and trust preferred securities. These securities were classified within level 3 of the hierarchy because proprietary assumptions related to  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

voluntary prepayment rates, default probabilities, loss severities and discount rates were considered significant to the valuation. There were no transfers of investment securities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  For additional discussion of the fair values of investment securities, see   Note 10   to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale at   September 30, 2016   included   $42.4 million   of commercial loans originated by SBF with the intent to sell in the secondary market. Commercial loans held for sale are comprised of the portion of loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Loans are generally sold with servicing retained. Servicing activity did not have a material impact on the results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We anticipate growth in loan sales and servicing and related revenue from SBF in the future.

     Table of Contents  

Total loans, including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs, increased by   $2.4 billion   to   $19.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $16.6 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . New loans grew by   $2.6 billion   while loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition declined by   $160 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . New residential loans grew by   $428 million   and new commercial loans grew by   $2.1 billion   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Growth in new loans, including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included   $809 million   for the Florida franchise,   $772 million   for the New York franchise and   $985 million   for the national platforms.

Residential Mortgages 
  Residential mortgages totaled   $4.0 billion  , or   21.0%   of total loans and   $3.7 billion  , or   22.3%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The new residential loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans purchased on a national basis through established correspondent channels. The portfolio also includes loans originated through retail channels in our Florida and New York geographic footprint. In January 2016, we terminated our retail residential mortgage origination business. New residential mortgage loans are primarily closed-end, first lien jumbo mortgages for the purchase or re-finance of owner occupied property. The loans have terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. At   September 30, 2016  ,   32.8%   of the new residential loan portfolio were fixed rate loans. The ARM portfolio included 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 ARMs. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $148 million   or   4.4%   of new residential mortgage loans were interest-only loans, substantially all of which begin amortizing 10 years after origination.  
  Home equity loans and lines of credit are not significant to the new loan portfolio. 
  We do not originate or acquire option ARMs,  no-doc  or  reduced-doc  mortgages and do not utilize wholesale mortgage origination channels although the covered loan portfolio contains loans with these characteristics. The Company s exposure to future losses on these mortgage loans is mitigated by the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement.

     Table of Contents  

The geographic concentration of the new 1-4 single family residential portfolio is summarized as follows at the dates indicated (dollar in thousands): 

Commercial loans 
  The commercial portfolio segment includes loans secured by multi-family properties, loans secured by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate, construction loans, land loans, commercial and industrial loans and direct financing leases. 
  Management s loan origination strategy is heavily focused on the commercial portfolio segment, which comprised   81.7%   and   81.4%   of new loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Commercial real estate loans include term loans secured by owner and non-owner occupied income producing properties including rental apartments, mixed-use properties, industrial properties, retail shopping centers, free-standing single-tenant buildings, office buildings, warehouse facilities and hotels as well as real estate secured lines of credit. Loans secured by commercial real estate typically have shorter repayment periods and re-price more frequently than 1-4 single family residential loans but may have longer terms and re-price less frequently than commercial and industrial loans. The Company s underwriting standards generally provide for loan terms of five to ten years, with amortization schedules of no more than thirty years. LTV ratios are typically limited to no more than 80%. In addition, the Company usually obtains personal guarantees or carve-out guarantees of the principals as an additional enhancement for commercial real estate loans. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans typically have risk profiles more closely aligned with that of commercial and industrial loans than with other types of commercial real estate loans. Construction and land loans represented only   1.5%   of the total loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . Construction and land loans are generally made for projects expected to stabilize within eighteen months of completion in submarkets with strong fundamentals and, to a lesser extent, for-sale residential projects to experienced developers with a strong cushion between market prices and loan basis. At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in construction loans with available interest reserves totaled   $89 million  ; the amount of available interest reserves totaled   $1 million  . All of these loans were rated  pass  at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small and middle market businesses and include equipment loans and leases, secured and unsecured working capital facilities, formula-based loans, mortgage warehouse lines, taxi medallion loans, lease financing, SBA product offerings and business acquisition finance credit facilities. These loans may be structured as term loans, typically with maturities of three to seven years, or revolving lines of credit which may have multi-year maturities. Commercial loans include shared national credits totaling   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , typically relationship based loans to borrowers in our geographic footprint. 
  Through its commercial lending subsidiaries, Pinnacle and Bridge, the Bank provides equipment and franchise financing on a national basis using both loan and lease structures. Pinnacle primarily offers essential use equipment financing to municipalities through loans and leases, as well as bond re-funding structures; Bridge offers franchise equipment and acquisition financing as well as transportation equipment finance. The Bank's SBF unit primarily originates SBA guaranteed commercial and commercial real estate loans, generally selling the guaranteed portion in the secondary market and retaining the unguaranteed portion in portfolio. The Bank engages in mortgage warehouse lending on a national basis.

Consumer Loans 
  Consumer loans are comprised primarily of consumer installment financing, loans secured by certificates of deposit, unsecured personal lines of credit and demand deposit account overdrafts.  
   
  Asset Quality 
  In discussing asset quality, we distinguish between new loans and loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition. Although the risk profile of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition is higher than that of new loans, our exposure to loss related to the loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition is significantly mitigated by the fair value basis recorded in these loans resulting from the application of acquisition accounting and, for the residential loans, by the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. Loss sharing under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement was terminated on May 21, 2014. At   September 30, 2016  , loans covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement totaled   $669 million  . 
  We have established a robust credit risk management framework, put in place an experienced team to lead the workout and recovery process for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios and implemented a dedicated internal credit review function that reports directly to our Audit and Risk Committee. We have an experienced resolution team in place for covered residential mortgage loans, and have implemented outsourcing arrangements with industry leading firms in certain areas such as OREO resolution.  
  Loan performance is monitored by our credit administration and workout and recovery departments. Generally, commercial relationships with balances in excess of defined thresholds are re-evaluated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. The defined thresholds range from   $1 million   to   $3 million  . Additionally, commercial loans are regularly reviewed by our internal credit review department. The Company utilizes a 13 grade internal asset risk classification system as part of its efforts to monitor and maintain commercial asset quality. Loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment capacity of the borrower are categorized as special mention. These borrowers may exhibit negative financial trends or erratic financial performance, strained liquidity, marginal collateral coverage, declining industry trends or weak management. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  

corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard. These borrowers may exhibit payment defaults, inadequate cash flows, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, exhausted interest reserves, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts or past due real estate taxes. Loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off, are assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful. 
  Residential mortgage loans and consumer loans are not individually risk rated. Delinquency status is the primary measure we use to monitor the credit quality of these loans. We also consider original LTV and FICO score to be significant indicators of credit quality for the new 1-4 single family residential portfolio. 
  New Loans 
  Commercial 
  The ongoing asset quality of significant commercial loans is monitored on an individual basis through our regular credit review and risk rating process. We believe internal risk rating is the best indicator of the credit quality of commercial loans. Homogenous groups of smaller balance commercial loans may be monitored collectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , new commercial loans with aggregate balances of   $66 million  ,   $310 million   and   $14 million   were rated special mention, substandard and doubtful, respectively. At   December 31, 2015  , new commercial loans aggregating   $32 million  ,   $198 million   and   $6 million   were rated special mention, substandard and doubtful, respectively. The balance of substandard loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included   $141.6 million   and   $80.5 million  , respectively, of taxi medallion finance loans. Criticized and classified assets represented   2.6%   of the new commercial portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 4   to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information about risk rating of new commercial loans. 
  The commercial and industrial loan portfolio includes exposure to taxi medallion finance of approximately   $192 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The estimated value of underlying taxi medallion collateral and liquidity in the market for sales of medallions, a potential secondary source of repayment, have declined in recent periods due to competitive developments in the transportation-for-hire industry. We update our analysis of the cash flow generating capacity of the operation of medallions on a regular basis using current available taxi industry data from which prospective debt service capacity is estimated. This analysis is based on an extensive data set typically made available by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission semi-annually and assumptions that we believe to be generally conservative regarding fleet utilization and borrower expenses. Actual debt service coverage of our medallion loans may in some cases be more favorable than these cash flow capacity estimates. We also consider, if less favorable than our analysis of cash flow generating capacity, available borrower specific financial information. We update our analysis of estimated medallion valuations on a quarterly basis, based on the cash flow capacity estimates and recent medallion transfer activity. The taxi medallion portfolio had the following characteristics at   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    Approximately   94.5%   of the portfolio was concentrated in New York City. 
                  
    Based on our updated analysis of medallion values, the weighted average estimated current LTV for loans directly secured by medallions was approximately   90%   and approximately   58.7%   of those loans had current LTV in excess of 100%. 
                
    Approximately   15.9%   of the portfolio consisted of interest only loans. 
                
    Based on our updated analysis of the estimated cash flow generating capacity of medallions, as discussed above, approximately   52.9%   of loans secured directly by taxi medallions had estimated prospective debt service coverage ratios of less than 1.00, the majority of which were current with respect to payment of principal and interest. 
                
    The portfolio included   60   loans modified in TDRs with a recorded investment of   $58.5 million  .

     Table of Contents  

We are no longer originating new taxi medallion loans. Our portfolio management strategies include, but are not limited to, working with borrowers experiencing temporary cash flow challenges to provide short term relief and/or extended amortization periods, pro-actively attempting to refinance loans prior to maturity, shortening amortization periods when possible with an emphasis on converting interest only loans, continuing to monitor industry data and obtain updated borrower and guarantor financial information, and identifying and closely monitoring loans with higher risk profiles. As taxi medallion loans approach maturity or are refinanced, we expect the number and amount of TDRs in this portfolio segment to increase. 
  Residential    
  New 1-4 single family residential loans past due more than 30 days totaled   $9.5 million   and   $2.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The amount of these loans 90 days or more past due was   $0.3 million   and $1.5 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The majority of our new residential mortgage portfolio consists of loans purchased through established correspondent channels. In general, we purchase performing jumbo mortgage loans which have FICO scores above 700, primarily are owner-occupied and full documentation, and have a current LTV of 80% or less. We perform due diligence on the purchased loans for credit, compliance, counterparty, payment history and property valuation. 
  The following tables show the distribution of new 1-4 single family residential loans by original FICO and LTV as of the dates indicated: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the new 1-4 single family residential loan portfolio had the following characteristics: substantially all were full documentation with an average FICO score of   767   and average LTV of   66.4%  . The majority of this portfolio was owner-occupied, with   88.6%   primary residence,   8.5%   second homes and   2.9%   investment properties. In terms of vintage,   11.6%   of the portfolio was originated pre-2013,   21.4%   in 2013,   19.2%   in   2014  ,   28.5%   in   2015   and   19.3%   in   2016  . 
  Consumer 
  One consumer loan with a carrying value of   $836 thousand   was past due more than 90 days at   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , there were no delinquent new consumer loans. 
  Loans Acquired in the     FSB Acquisition    
  Loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition consist of both ACI loans and non-ACI loans. At   September 30, 2016  , ACI loans totaled   $631 million   and non-ACI loans totaled   $85 million  , including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs.

     Table of Contents  

Residential 
  At   September 30, 2016  , residential ACI loans totaled   $584 million   and residential non-ACI loans totaled   $85 million  , including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs. All of these loans are covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. 
  Covered residential loans were placed into homogenous pools at the time of the FSB Acquisition and the ongoing credit quality and performance of these loans is monitored on a pool basis. The fair value of the pools was initially measured based on the expected cash flows from each pool. Initial cash flow expectations incorporated significant assumptions regarding prepayment rates, frequency of default and loss severity. For ACI pools, the difference between total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received at acquisition was recognized as non-accretable difference. The excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value of each ACI pool at acquisition, known as the accretable yield, is being recognized as interest income over the life of each pool. We monitor the pools quarterly to determine whether any significant changes have occurred in expected cash flows that would be indicative of impairment or necessitate reclassification between non-accretable difference and accretable yield.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , accretable yield on residential ACI loans totaled   $683 million   and non-accretable difference related to those loans totaled   $438 million  . Accretable yield on residential ACI loans decreased by $27 million and non-accretable difference decreased by $55 million in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of updates to assumptions about the expected timing of cash flows. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in non-ACI 1-4 single family residential loans was   $32.8 million  ;   $1.3 million   or   3.9%   of these loans were 30 days or more past due and   $0.9 million   or   2.8%   of these loans were 90 days or more past due. At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in ACI 1-4 single family residential loans totaled   $580.8 million  ;   $29.7 million   or   5.1%   of these loans were delinquent by 30 days or more and   $15.0 million   or   2.6%   were delinquent by 90 days or more.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , non-ACI home equity loans and lines of credit had an aggregate recorded investment of   $52.6 million  ;   $2.9 million   or   5.6%   of these loans were 30 days or more past due and   $2.4 million   or   4.6%   were 90 days or more past due. ACI home equity loans and lines of credit had a carrying amount of   $3.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  ; amounts 30 days or more contractually delinquent were not significant. 
  Home equity loans and lines of credit generally provide that payment terms be reset after an initial contractual period of interest only payments, requiring the pay down of principal through balloon payments or amortization. Additional information regarding ACI and non-ACI home equity loans and lines of credit at   September 30, 2016   is summarized as follows: 

The Company's exposure to loss related to covered loans is significantly mitigated by the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and by the fair value basis recorded in these assets resulting from the application of acquisition accounting. While resets of interest only loans have contributed to an increase in default rates for the covered home equity portfolio, the impact on results of operations, after consideration of the mitigating impact of loss sharing, is not significant.  
  Commercial 
  At   September 30, 2016  , ACI commercial loans had a carrying value of   $47.2 million  . The carrying amount of ACI commercial loans that were past due, criticized or classified at   September 30, 2016   was not significant.

Impaired Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
  Non-performing assets generally consist of (i) non-accrual loans, including loans that have been modified in TDRs and placed on non-accrual status, (ii) accruing loans that are more than 90 days contractually past due as to interest or principal, excluding ACI loans, and (iii) OREO and repossessed assets. Impaired loans also typically include loans modified in TDRs that are accruing and ACI loans for which expected cash flows have been revised downward since acquisition (as adjusted for any additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition). Impaired ACI loans or pools with remaining accretable yield have not been classified as non-accrual loans and we do not consider them to be non-performing assets.   
  The following table summarizes the Company's impaired loans and non-performing assets at the dates indicated (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Non-performing new commercial and industrial loans include taxi medallion loans with a carrying value of   $54.5 million   and   $2.6 million  , and performing TDRs include taxi medallion loans with a carrying value of   $32.8 million   and   $0.6 million  , at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we are no longer reporting accruing TDRs as non-performing. 
              (3) 
    Total loans for purposes of calculating these ratios include premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs. 
              (4) 
    Ratio for non-covered assets is calculated as non-performing non-covered assets to total assets. 
              (5) 
    Annualized. 
     The primary driver of the increases in non-covered, non-performing loans and non-covered performing TDRs and of the decrease in the ratio of the ALLL to non-performing loans at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was increases in non-accrual loans and TDRs in the taxi medallion portfolio. 
  Contractually delinquent ACI loans with remaining accretable yield are not reflected as non-accrual loans because accretion continues to be recorded in income. Accretion continues to be recorded as long as there is an expectation of future cash flows in excess of carrying amount from these loans. The carrying value of ACI loans contractually delinquent by more than 90 days but on which income was still being recognized was   $15 million   and   $20 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  New and non-ACI commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when (i) management has determined that full repayment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt, or (ii) the loan is past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. New and non-ACI residential and consumer loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when 90 days of interest is due and unpaid. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income. Commercial loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due principal and interest has been collected and full repayment of remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured. Residential loans are generally returned to accrual status when less than 90 days of interest is due and unpaid. Past due status of loans is determined based on the contractual next payment due date. Loans less than 30 days past due are reported as current. 
  A loan modification is considered a TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise grant. These concessions may take the form of temporarily or permanently reduced interest rates, payment abatement periods, restructuring of payment terms, extensions of maturity at below market terms, or in some cases, partial forgiveness of principal. Under GAAP, modified ACI loans accounted for in pools are not accounted for as TDRs and are not separated from their respective pools when modified. Included in TDRs are residential loans to borrowers who have not reaffirmed their debt discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  
  The following table summarizes loans modified in TDRs at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

Potential Problem Loans 
  Potential problem loans have been identified by management as those loans included in the "substandard accruing" risk rating category. These loans are typically performing, but possess specifically identified credit weaknesses that, if not remedied, may lead to a downgrade to non-accrual status and identification as impaired in the near-term. Substandard accruing new loans totaled   $213 million  , of which   $88 million   were taxi medallion loans, at   September 30, 2016  . The majority of these loans were current as to principal and interest at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Loss Mitigation Strategies 
  Criticized or classified commercial loans in excess of certain thresholds are reviewed quarterly by the Criticized Asset Committee, which determines the appropriate strategy for collection to mitigate the amount of credit losses. Criticized asset reports for each relationship are presented by the assigned relationship manager to the Criticized Asset Committee until such time as the relationships are returned to a satisfactory credit risk rating or otherwise resolved. The Criticized Asset Committee may require the transfer of a loan to our workout and recovery department, which is tasked to effectively manage the loan with the goal of minimizing losses and expenses associated with restructure, collection and/or liquidation of collateral. Commercial loans with a risk rating of substandard; impaired loans on non-accrual status; loans modified as TDRs; or assets classified as OREO or repossessed assets are usually transferred to workout and recovery. Oversight of the workout and recovery department is provided by the Asset Recovery Committee.  
  We evaluate each residential loan in default to determine the most effective loss mitigation strategy, which may be modification, short sale, or foreclosure. We offer loan modifications under HAMP to eligible borrowers in the residential portfolio. HAMP is a uniform loan modification process that provides eligible borrowers with sustainable monthly mortgage payments equal to a target 31% of their gross monthly income. We have approved 4,432 permanent loan modifications through   September 30, 2016   and there are 22 trial loan modifications at   September 30, 2016  . Substantially all of these modified loans were covered ACI loans accounted for in pools.  
  In addition to the HAMP program, we offer a proprietary Subordinate Lien Modification Program for home equity loans and lines of credit. This provides BankUnited the ability to offer a modification on loans covered under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement that are subordinate to either a BankUnited first lien or a first lien from another lender. 
   
  Analysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
  The ALLL relates to (i) new loans, (ii) estimated additional losses arising on non-ACI loans subsequent to the FSB Acquisition, and (iii) impairment recognized as a result of decreases in expected cash flows on ACI loans due to further credit deterioration. The impact of any additional provision for losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by an increase in the FDIC indemnification asset. The determination of the amount of the ALLL is, by nature, highly complex and subjective. Future events that are inherently uncertain could result in material changes to the level of the ALLL. General economic conditions including but not limited to unemployment rates, the level of business investment and growth, real estate values, vacancy rates and rental rates in our primary market areas, the level of interest rates, and a variety of other factors that affect the ability of borrowers  businesses to generate cash flows sufficient to service their debts will impact the future performance of the portfolio.  
  New and non-  ACI     Loans    
  Residential 
  Due to the lack of similarity between the risk characteristics of new loans and covered loans in the residential and home equity portfolios, management does not believe it is appropriate to use the historical performance of the covered residential mortgage portfolio as a basis for calculating the ALLL applicable to new loans. The new loan portfolio has not yet developed an observable loss trend. Therefore, the ALLL for new residential loans is based primarily on relevant proxy historical loss rates. The ALLL for new 1-4 single family residential loans is estimated using average annual loss rates on prime residential mortgage securitizations issued between 2003 and 2008 as a proxy. Based on the comparability of FICO scores and LTV ratios between loans included in those securitizations and loans in the Bank s portfolio and the geographic diversity in the new purchased residential portfolio, we determined that prime residential mortgage securitizations provide an appropriate proxy for incurred losses in this portfolio class. A peer group 16-quarter average net charge-off rate is used to estimate the ALLL for the new home equity loan class. See further discussion of the use of peer group loss factors below. The new home equity portfolio is not a significant component of the overall loan portfolio.  
  Based on an analysis of historical performance, OREO and short sale losses, recent trending data and other internal and external factors, we have concluded that historical performance by portfolio class is the best indicator of incurred loss for the non-ACI 1-4 single family residential and home equity portfolio classes. For each of these portfolio classes, a quarterly roll rate matrix is calculated by delinquency bucket to measure the rate at which loans move from one delinquency bucket to the next during a given quarter. An average 16-quarter roll rate matrix is used to estimate the amount within each delinquency bucket expected to roll to 120+ days delinquent. We assume no cure for those loans that are currently 120+ days delinquent. Loss severity given default is estimated based on internal data about OREO sales and short sales from the portfolio. The ALLL calculation incorporates a 100% loss severity assumption for home equity loans that are projected to roll to default. For non-ACI residential loans, the allowance is initially calculated based on UPB. The total of UPB less the calculated allowance is then compared to the carrying amount of the loans, net of unamortized credit related fair value adjustments established at acquisition. If the calculated balance net of the allowance is less than the carrying amount, an additional allowance is established. Any increase or decrease in the allowance for non-ACI residential loans will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the FDIC indemnification asset.   
  Commercial and Consumer 
  Since the new commercial loan portfolio is not yet seasoned enough to exhibit a loss trend, the ALLL for new commercial loans is based primarily on peer group average annual historical net charge-off rates by loan class and the Company s internal credit risk rating system. The allowance is comprised of specific reserves for loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired as well as general reserves for individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired and loans that do not meet our established threshold for individual evaluation. Commercial relationships graded substandard or doubtful  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

and on non-accrual status with committed credit facilities greater than or equal to $1 million are individually evaluated for impairment. For loans evaluated individually for impairment and determined to be impaired, a specific allowance is established based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the estimated fair value of the loan, or the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell. Loans modified in TDRs are also evaluated individually for impairment. We believe that loans rated special mention, substandard or doubtful that are not individually evaluated for impairment exhibit characteristics indicative of a heightened level of credit risk. Loss factors for these loans are determined by using default frequency and severity information applied at the loan level. Estimated default frequencies and severities are based on available industry data. 
  With the exception of the Pinnacle municipal finance portfolio, a four quarter loss emergence period is used in the calculation of general reserves. A twelve quarter loss emergence period is used in the calculation of general reserves for the Pinnacle portfolio. 
  The peer group used to calculate the average annual historical net charge-off rates that form the basis for our general reserve calculations for new commercial, home equity and consumer loans is made up of the banks included in the OCC Midsize Bank Group plus two additional banks in the New York region that management believes to be comparable based on size and nature of lending operations. The OCC Midsize Bank Group primarily includes commercial banks with total assets ranging from $10 - $50 billion and included 28 banks at   September 30, 2016  . Peer bank data is obtained from the Statistics on Depository Institutions Report published by the FDIC for the most recent quarter available. These banks, as a group, are considered by management to be comparable to BankUnited in size, nature of lending operations and loan portfolio composition. We evaluate the composition of the peer group annually, or more frequently if, in our judgment, a more frequent evaluation is necessary. The general loss factor for municipal finance receivables is based on a historical cumulative default curve for municipal obligations of credit quality comparable to those in the Company s portfolio.  
  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we extended the loss experience period used to calculate peer group average annual net charge-off rates from 12 quarters to 16 quarters for commercial and consumer loans. We believe this extension of the look back period is appropriate at this time to capture a sufficient range of observations reflecting the performance of our loans, most of which were originated in the current economic cycle, and to reflect recent indications that the U.S. economy continues to move through the credit cycle. We believe the 16-quarter look back period to be consistent with the range of industry practice. Extending the look back period to 16 quarters resulted in an increase in the ALLL of approximately $9 million as of March 31, 2016, as compared to using a 12-quarter look back period at the same date. The framework used to determine qualitative reserves was not revised. 
  Our internal risk rating system comprises 13 credit grades; grades 1 through 8 are  pass  grades. The risk ratings are driven largely by debt service coverage. Peer group historical loss rates are adjusted upward for loans assigned a lower  pass  rating.  
  Qualitative Factors 
  Qualitative adjustments are made to the ALLL when, based on management s judgment, there are internal or external factors impacting probable incurred losses not taken into account by the quantitative calculations. Potential qualitative adjustments are categorized as follows:  
             
    Portfolio performance trends, including trends in and the levels of delinquencies, non-performing loans and classified loans;   
                
    Changes in the nature of the portfolio and terms of the loans, specifically including the volume and nature of policy and procedural exceptions;  
                
    Portfolio growth trends;   
                
    Changes in lending policies and procedures, including credit and underwriting guidelines;   
                
    Economic factors, including unemployment rates and GDP growth rates;  
                
    Changes in the value of underlying collateral;  
                
    Quality of risk ratings, as evaluated by our independent loan review function;   
                
    Credit concentrations;   
                
    Changes in and experience levels of credit administration management and staff; and  
                
    Other factors identified by management that may impact the level of losses inherent in the portfolio, including but not limited to competition and legal and regulatory considerations.

ACI     Loans 
  For ACI loans, a valuation allowance is established when periodic evaluations of expected cash flows reflect a decrease resulting from credit related factors from the level of cash flows that were estimated to be collected at acquisition plus any additional expected cash flows arising from revisions in those estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of expected cash flows for ACI loans. 
  Expected cash flows are estimated on a pool basis for ACI 1-4 single family residential and home equity loans. The analysis of expected pool cash flows incorporates updated pool level expected prepayment rate, default rate, delinquency level and loss severity given default assumptions. Prepayment, delinquency and default curves are derived primarily from roll rates generated from the historical performance of the portfolio over the immediately preceding four quarters. Estimates of default probability and loss severity given default also incorporate updated LTV ratios, at the loan level, based on Case-Shiller Home Price Indices for the relevant MSA. Costs and fees represent an additional component of loss on default and are projected based on historical experience over the last three years. The ACI home equity roll rates include the impact of delinquent, related senior liens and loans to borrowers who have not reaffirmed their debt discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  
  Based on our projected cash flow analysis, no ALLL related to 1-4 single family residential and home equity ACI pools was recorded at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  The primary assumptions underlying estimates of expected cash flows for ACI commercial loans are default probability and severity of loss given default. Assessments of default probability and severity are based on net realizable value analyses prepared at the individual loan level. Based on our analysis, no ALLL related to ACI commercial loans was recorded at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

     The balance of the ALLL for new loans at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily reflects the impact of an increase related to growth of the new loan portfolio and an increase in reserves for classified loans, including loans determined to be individually impaired. Factors influencing the change in the ALLL as related to specific loan types at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   December 31, 2015  , include:

     Table of Contents  

A decline of   $0.3 million   for new 1 - 4 single family residential loans in spite of growth in the corresponding portfolio was attributable to a decline in the applicable quantitative historical loss rate and a reduction in qualitative reserves applied to the originated portfolio. 
                
    An increase of   $3.4 million   for new owner occupied commercial real estate loans was attributable to the growth of the corresponding loan portfolio and increases in reserves for classified loans. 
                
    A   $7.4 million   increase for new non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans was primarily attributable to the growth of the corresponding loan portfolio. 
                
    An increase of   $15.3 million   for new commercial and industrial loans was primarily driven by an increase in the peer group based historical loss factor for this portfolio segment and increases in reserves for classified and impaired loans, including taxi medallion loans. The reserve for classified and impaired loans in this portfolio segment increased by $14.3 million, of which $7.0 million related to the taxi medallion portfolio.  
                
    A   $4.5 million   increase for commercial lending subsidiaries reflects the growth of the portfolio, an increase in the peer group historical loss factor and increases in reserves for classified and individually impaired loans. 
                
    The decrease in the reserve for non-ACI loans resulted primarily from a decline in related portfolio balances and an improvement in roll rates for the home equity segment. 
     For additional information about the ALLL, see   Note 4   to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Equipment under Operating Lease 
  Equipment under operating lease primarily consists of railcars leased to North American commercial end-users. The portfolio also includes non-commercial aircraft and other land transport equipment. At   September 30, 2016  , our operating lease fleet consisted of   4,893   rail cars, including hoppers, tank cars, boxcars, auto carriers, center beams and gondolas;   1,182   trailers;   34   tractors;   19   forklifts;   53   utility trucks and   2   helicopters. The largest concentrations of rail cars were   2,125   hopper cars and   1,534   tank cars, primarily used to ship sand and petroleum products, respectively, for the energy industry. Equipment with a carrying value of   $290 million   at   September 30, 2016   was leased to companies for use in the energy industry. Three of these operating lease relationships with assets under lease totaling   $51 million   were internally risk rated substandard at   September 30, 2016  .  
  There have been no significant impairments of residuals or asset carrying values, missed payments or time off-lease related to the operating lease portfolio to date. One relationship was restructured in July 2016, with no decrease in total minimum lease payments. 
   The primary risks inherent in the equipment leasing business are asset risk resulting from ownership of the equipment on operating lease and credit risk. Asset risk arises from fluctuations in supply and demand for the underlying leased equipment. Railcars are long-lived equipment with useful lives of approximately 35-50 years. The equipment is leased to commercial end-users with lease terms ranging from 3-10 years at   September 30, 2016  . We are exposed to the risk that, at the end of the lease term, the value of the asset will be lower than expected, potentially resulting in reduced future lease income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value. Asset risk may also lead to changes in depreciation as a result of changes in the residual values of the operating lease assets or through impairment of asset carrying values.  
  Asset risk is evaluated and managed by an internal team of leasing professionals with a broad depth and breadth of experience in the leasing business. Additionally, we have partnered with an industry leading, experienced service provider who provides fleet management and servicing, including lease administration and reporting, a Regulation Y compliant full service maintenance program and railcar remarketing. Risk is managed by setting appropriate residual values at inception and systematic reviews of residual values based on independent appraisals, performed at least annually. Additionally, our internal management team and our external service provider closely follow the rail markets, monitoring traffic flows, supply and demand trends and the impact of new technologies and regulatory requirements. Demand for railcars is sensitive to shifts in general and industry specific economic and market trends and shifts in trade flows from specific events such as natural or man-made disasters. We seek to mitigate these risks by leasing to a stable end-user base, by maintaining a relatively young and diversified fleet of assets that are expected to maintain stronger and more stable utilization rates despite impacts from unexpected events or cyclical trends and by staggering lease maturities. We regularly monitor the impact of lower oil prices on the estimated residual value of rail cars being used in the petroleum/natural gas extraction sector.  
  Credit risk in the leased equipment portfolio results from the potential default of lessees, possibly driven by obligor specific or industry-wide conditions, and is economically less significant than asset risk, because in the operating lease business, there is no extension of credit to the obligor. Instead, the lessor deploys a portion of the useful life of the asset. Credit

     Table of Contents  

losses, if any, will manifest through reduced rental income due to missed payments, time off lease, or lower rental payments due either to a restructuring or re-leasing of the asset to another obligor. Credit risk in the operating lease portfolio is managed and monitored utilizing credit administration infrastructure, processes and procedures similar to those used to manage and monitor credit risk in the commercial loan portfolio. We also mitigate credit risk in this portfolio by leasing only to high credit quality obligors. 
  We expect our operating lease portfolio to continue to grow, and we may expand into other asset classes. We are not currently increasing our exposure to the energy sector. 
  Deposits 
  Average balances and rates paid on deposits were as follows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 

Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included   $1.9 billion   and $1.1 billion, respectively, of brokered deposits.

FHLB     Advances, Notes and Other Borrowings 
  In addition to deposits, we utilize FHLB advances to fund growth in interest earning assets; the advances provide us with additional flexibility in managing both term and cost of funding. FHLB advances are secured by FHLB stock, qualifying residential first mortgage, commercial real estate and home equity loans, and MBS.  
  The contractual balance of FHLB advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   is scheduled to mature as follows (in thousands):

Senior notes have a face amount of   $400 million  , a fixed coupon rate of   4.875%   and mature on   November 17, 2025  .  
   
  Capital Resources 
  Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tier system for measuring the capital adequacy of the financial institutions they supervise. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , BankUnited and the Company had capital levels that exceeded both the regulatory well-capitalized guidelines and all internal capital ratio targets.  
  Stockholders' equity increased to   $2.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $129 million  , or   5.8%  , from   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the retention of earnings.

(1)   There is no T  ier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. 
  Levels of capital required to be well capitalized or adequately capitalized as reflected above do not include a capital conservation buffer that is being phased in. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Bank and the Company will have to maintain this capital conservation buffer composed of CET1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the amounts to be adequately capitalized, as reflected above, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 
   
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity involves our ability to generate adequate funds to support planned asset growth, particularly growth of the new loan portfolio, meet deposit withdrawal requests, maintain reserve requirements, conduct routine operations, pay dividends, service outstanding debt and meet other contractual obligations. 
  Primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, cash generated by the repayment and resolution of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition, cash payments received from the FDIC pursuant to the Residential Shared Loss Agreement, deposit growth, the available for sale securities portfolio and FHLB advances.  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $226.4 million   and   $160.2 million  , respectively. Accretion on ACI loans, which is reflected as a non-cash reduction in net income to arrive at operating cash flows, totaled   $228.5 million   and $216.2 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Accretable yield on ACI loans represents the excess of expected future cash flows over the carrying amount of the loans, and is recognized as interest income over the expected lives of the loans. Amounts recorded as accretion are realized in cash as individual loans are paid down or otherwise resolved; however, the timing of cash realization may differ from the timing of income recognition. These cash flows from the repayment or resolution of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition, inclusive of amounts that have been accreted through earnings over time, are recognized as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows upon receipt. Cash generated by the repayment and resolution of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition totaled $399.4 million and $489.6 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash payments from the FDIC in the form of reimbursements of losses related to the covered loans under the Loss Sharing Agreements are also characterized as investing cash flows. These reimbursements from the FDIC totaled   $30.8 million   and   $46.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Both cash generated by the repayment and resolution of loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition and cash payments received from the FDIC have been and are expected to continue to be consistent and relatively predictable sources of liquidity. 
  The percentage of assets comprised of ACI loans and percentage of interest income comprised of ACI accretion continues to decrease. As expected, cash flows from resolution of the loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition are being replaced by operating cash flows from new assets originated with those proceeds, resulting in increasing cash inflows from operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . In addition to cash provided by operating activities, the repayment and resolution of covered loans and payments under the Single Family Shared-

Loss Agreement from the FDIC, BankUnited s liquidity needs, particularly liquidity to fund growth of the new loan portfolio, have been and continue to be met by deposit growth, its amortizing investment portfolio, and FHLB advances. 
  BankUnited has access to additional liquidity through FHLB advances, other collateralized borrowings, wholesale deposits or the sale of available for sale securities. At   September 30, 2016  , unencumbered investment securities available for sale totaled   $3.8 billion  . At   September 30, 2016  , BankUnited had available borrowing capacity at the FHLB of   $2.5 billion  , unused borrowing capacity at the FRB of   $422 million   and unused Federal funds lines of credit totaling   $70 million  . Management also has the ability to exert substantial control over the rate and timing of growth of the new loan portfolio, and resultant requirements for liquidity to fund new loans. 
  Continued runoff of the covered loan portfolio and FDIC indemnification asset and growth of deposits and the new loan portfolio are the most significant trends expected to impact the Bank s liquidity in the near term. 
  The ALCO policy has established several measures of liquidity which are monitored monthly by ALCO and quarterly by the Board of Directors. One measure of liquidity monitored by management is the 30 day total liquidity ratio, defined as (a) the sum of cash and cash equivalents, pledgeable securities, a measure of funds expected to be generated by operations over the next 30 days, and borrowing capacity from the FHLB and brokered deposits; divided by (b) the sum of potential deposit runoff, liabilities maturing and a measure of funds expected to be used in operations over the next 30 days. BankUnited s liquidity is considered acceptable if the 30 day total liquidity ratio exceeds 100%. At   September 30, 2016  , BankUnited s 30 day total liquidity ratio was   139%  . Management also monitors a one year liquidity ratio, defined as (a) cash and cash equivalents, pledgeable securities, unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB, and loans and non-agency securities maturing within one year; divided by (b) deposits and borrowings maturing within one year. The maturity of deposits, excluding certificate of deposits, is based on retention rates derived from the most recent external core deposit analysis obtained by the Company. This ratio allows management to monitor liquidity over a longer time horizon. The acceptable threshold established by ALCO for this liquidity measure is 100%. At   September 30, 2016  , BankUnited s one year liquidity ratio was   121%  . Additional measures of liquidity regularly monitored by ALCO include the ratio of wholesale funding to total assets, the ratio of FHLB advances to tier 1 capital plus the ALLL, a measure of available liquidity to volatile liabilities and the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits. At   September 30, 2016  , BankUnited was within acceptable limits established by ALCO for each of these measures. 
  As a holding company, BankUnited, Inc. is a corporation separate and apart from its banking subsidiary, and therefore, provides for its own liquidity. BankUnited, Inc. s main sources of funds include management fees and dividends from the Bank, access to capital markets and, to a lesser extent, its own available for sale securities portfolio. There are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to BankUnited, Inc. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing near-term cash obligations. 
  We expect that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied over the next 12 months through the sources of funds described above. 
   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The principal component of the Company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, or market risk, is interest rate risk, including the risk that assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree. A primary objective of the Company s asset/liability management activities is to maximize net interest income, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk. The ALCO is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk, and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with these policies. The guidelines established by ALCO are approved at least annually by the Board of Directors. 
  Management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of interest rate risk. Income simulation analysis is designed to capture not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice, but also the probability that they will do so. Income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items, and projects their behavior over an extended period of time. Finally, income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates, but also of proposed strategies for responding to them. 
  The income simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over twelve and twenty-four month periods in a most likely rate scenario based on consensus forward interest rate curves versus net interest income in alternative rate scenarios. Simulations are generated based on both static and dynamic balance sheet assumptions. Management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate. Currently, our model projects a down 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point change with rates increasing by the magnitude of the rate ramp evenly over the next 12 months as well as flattening yield curve scenarios and instantaneous rate  
  
   75

shocks of down 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis points. We continually evaluate the scenarios being modeled with a view toward adapting them to changing economic conditions, expectations and trends. 
  The Company s ALCO policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if decreases in forecast net interest income, based on a dynamic forecasted balance sheet, in the down 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point rate shock scenarios are within specified percentages of forecast net interest income in the most likely rate scenario over the next twelve months and in the second year. The following table illustrates the acceptable limits and the impact on forecasted net interest income of down 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point rate shock scenarios at   September 30, 2016  :  

Management also simulates changes in EVE in various interest rate environments. The ALCO policy has established parameters of acceptable risk that are defined in terms of the percentage change in EVE from a base scenario under six rate scenarios, derived by implementing immediate parallel movements of plus and minus 100, 200 and 300 basis points from current rates. We did not simulate decreases in interest rates greater than 100 basis points at   September 30, 2016   due to the current low rate environment. The parameters established by ALCO stipulate that the modeled decline in EVE is considered acceptable if the decline is less than 9% in a down 100 basis point scenario, and less than 9%, 18% and 27% in plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point scenarios, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , our simulation for the Company indicated percentage changes from base EVE of (2.3)%,   (3.5)%  ,   (10.5)%   and   (16.0)%   in down 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point scenarios, respectively. 
  These measures fall within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by ALCO and the Board of Directors. In the event the models indicate an unacceptable level of risk, the Company could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk, including the sale or re-positioning of a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio, restructuring of borrowings, or the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and caps. 
  Many assumptions were used by the Company to calculate the impact of changes in interest rates, including the change in rates. Actual results may not be similar to the Company s projections due to several factors including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions, changes in depositor behavior and the shape of the yield curve. Actual results may also differ due to the Company s actions, if any, in response to changing rates and conditions. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Interest rate swaps are one of the tools we use to manage interest rate risk. These derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates on variable rate borrowings such as FHLB advances and time deposits and to manage duration of liabilities. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The fair value of these instruments is included in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of   $2.0 billion  . The aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges included in other liabilities was   $79 million   and the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges included in other assets was not significant. 
  Interest rate swaps and caps not designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps and caps included in other assets was   $55 million   and the aggregate fair value included in other liabilities was   $55 million  . These interest rate swaps and caps were entered into as accommodations to certain of our commercial borrowers. 
  See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Commitments 
  We routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to our customers, including commitments to fund loans or lines of credit and commercial and standby letters of credit. The credit risk associated with these commitments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and they are subject to our normal credit policies and approval processes. While these commitments represent contractual cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The following table details our outstanding commitments to extend credit as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is relevant to understanding the capital position and performance of the Company. Disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure also provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measurement of tangible book value per common share to the comparable GAAP financial measurement of book value per common share at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands except share and per share data):
