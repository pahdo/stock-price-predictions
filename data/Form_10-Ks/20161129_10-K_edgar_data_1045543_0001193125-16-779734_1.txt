ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS.                Introduction             United Refining Company ( URC  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company,   we,   us  and  our ) is a Pennsylvania corporation that began business
operations in 1902. We are the leading integrated refiner and marketer of petroleum products in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania, which is located within the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts I ( PADD
I ). We own and operate a medium complexity 70,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) petroleum refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania where we refine crude oil into a variety of finished products, including various grades of gasoline, ultra-low
sulfur diesel fuel, kerosene, No. 2 heating oil and asphalt. We have a long history of service within our market area. Our first retail service station was established in 1927 near the Warren, Pennsylvania refinery, and we have steadily expanded our
distribution network over the years.            Our operations are organized into two major business segments: refining/wholesale and retail. The refining division operates the refinery in Warren and offsite terminals. The wholesale division sells
finished products produced at the Warren refinery, primarily in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania, to both our retail network and to third-party customers. The retail business segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill     , Citgo     , Keystone      and Country Fair      brand names at a network of Company operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through convenience
stores under the Red Apple Food Mart      and Country Fair      brand names.            For fiscal 2016, we had total net sales of $2.1 billion. Of total sales, petroleum based sales were approximately 53% gasoline, 18% distillate, 15% asphalt and the remaining 14% were from sales of
merchandise and other revenue.            Our Operations    
         Refining Operations    
        Our refinery, located on a 107-acre site in Warren,
Pennsylvania, has a nominal capacity of 70,000 bpd of crude oil processing and averaged saleable production of approximately 65,600 bpd during fiscal 2016. We believe our location in the product-short PADD I, in an area that is geographically
distant from the majority of PADD I refining capacity, is a significant marketing advantage. The nearest fuels refinery is over 160 miles from Warren, Pennsylvania and we believe that no significant production from such refinery is currently shipped
into our primary market area.            A new ten million
standard cubic feet per day hydrogen plant was commissioned in May 2016, improving the management of the refinery hydrogen demand and reducing purchased hydrogen cost.   
         Our Products    
        We produce three primary petroleum products: gasoline,
middle distillates and asphalt. We presently produce two grades of unleaded gasoline, 87-octane regular and 93-octane premium, and also blend these to produce a mid-grade 89-octane. Middle distillates include kerosene, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel
and No. 2 heating oil. We optimize our bottom-of-the-barrel processing by producing asphalt, a higher value alternative to residual fuel oil. Our refining configuration allows the processing of a wide variety of crude oil inputs and our ability to
market asphalt on a year-round basis enables us to purchase selected heavier crude oils at higher differentials and lower costs.  
         4

    Refining Process             Our production of petroleum products from crude oil involves many complex steps, which are briefly summarized
below.            We seek to maximize refinery profitability
by selecting crude oil and other feedstocks taking into account factors including product demand and pricing in our market areas as well as price, quality and availability of various grades of crude oil. We also consider product inventory levels and
any planned turnarounds of refinery units for maintenance. The combination of these factors is optimized by a sophisticated proprietary linear programming computer model, which selects the most profitable feedstock and product mix. The linear
programming model is continuously updated and improved to reflect changes in the product marketplace and in the refinery s processing capability.         
  Blended crude is stored in a tank farm near the refinery, which has a capacity of approximately 499,000 barrels. The blended crude is then
brought into the refinery where it is first distilled at low pressure into its component streams in the crude and preflash unit. This yields the following intermediate products: light products consisting of fuel gas components (methane and ethane)
and LPG (propane and butane), naphtha or gasoline, kerosene, diesel or heating oil, heavy atmospheric distillate, and crude tower bottoms which are further distilled under vacuum conditions to yield light and heavy vacuum distillates and
asphalt.           The intermediate products are then
processed in downstream units and blended to produce finished products. A naphtha hydrotreater treats naphtha and FCC light catalytic naphtha with hydrogen across a fixed bed catalyst to remove sulfur before further treatment. The treated naphtha is
then distilled into light and heavy naphtha at a prefractionator. Light naphtha is then sent to an isomerization unit and heavy naphtha is sent to a reformer, in each case for octane enhancement. The isomerization unit converts the light naphtha
catalytically into a gasoline component with 83 octane and reduces benzene. The reformer unit converts the heavy naphtha into another gasoline component with up to 94 octane depending upon the desired octane requirement for the grade of gasoline to
be produced. The reformer also produces as a co-product, hydrogen needed to operate hydrotreating units in the refinery. A hydrogen plant converts natural gas into hydrogen to supplement the hydrogen supplied by the reformer.   
        Raw kerosene is treated with hydrogen at a distillate
hydrotreater to remove sulfur to make finished kerosene. A distillate hydrotreater built in 1993 and modified in 2012 with the addition of a second hydrotreater reactor also treats raw distillates to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel.   
        The long molecular chains of the heavy atmospheric and vacuum
distillates are broken or  cracked  in the FCC unit and separated and recovered in the gas concentration unit to produce fuel gas, propylene, butylene, LPG, light and heavy catalytic naphtha gasoline, light cycle oil and clarified oil.
Fuel gas is burned within the refinery, propylene is fed to a polymerization unit which polymerizes its molecules into a larger chain to produce an 87 octane gasoline component, butylene is fed into an alkylation unit to produce a gasoline component
and LPG is treated to remove trace quantities of water and then sold. Clarified oil is burned in the refinery or sold. Various refinery gasoline components are blended together in refinery tankage to produce 87 octane and 93 octane finished
gasoline. Likewise, light cycle oil is blended with other distillates to produce No. 2 heating oil. FCC light and heavy catalytic naphtha are hydrotreated in order to meet new more stringent legally mandated limits on gasoline sulfur content which
took effect January 1, 2008, and a portion of the light cycle oil is hydrotreated in order to meet new more stringent legally mandated limits on diesel fuel sulfur content which took effect June 1, 2006.   
        Our refining configuration allows the processing of a wide
variety of crude oil inputs. During the past five years our inputs have been predominantly of Canadian origin and range from light low sulfur (38 degrees API, 0.5% sulfur) to high sulfur heavy asphaltic (21 degrees API, 3.5% sulfur). Our
ability to market asphalt on a year-round basis enables us to purchase selected heavier crude oils at higher differentials and thus at a lower cost.

    Supply of Crude Oil             Substantially all of our crude supply is sourced from Canada and the northern plain states through the Enbridge
Pipeline system. We are however not dependent on this source alone. We could within a reasonable time period shift up to 70% of our crude oil requirements to some combination of domestic and offshore crude. With additional time, 100% of our crude
requirements could be obtained from non-Canadian sources. This change in crude supply could result in a different crude slate and alter product yields and product mix and could affect refinery profitability. Forty-eight percent of our term contracts
with our crude suppliers are on a month-to-month evergreen basis, with 60-to-90 day cancellation provisions; 52% of our term crude contracts are on an annual basis (with month to month pricing provisions). As of August 31, 2016, we had supply
contracts with 12 major suppliers for an aggregate of 66,988 bpd of crude oil. We have contracts with four suppliers amounting to approximately 67% of daily crude oil supply. None of the remaining suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our crude
oil supply.            We access crude through the Kiantone
Pipeline, a 78-mile Company-owned and operated pipeline, which connects with the Enbridge Pipeline system in West Seneca, New York, which is near Buffalo. The Enbridge Pipeline system provides access to most North American and foreign crude oils
through three primary routes: (i) Canadian and US domestic crude from both Western Canada and North Dakota (Bakken) are transported eastward through the Enbridge mainline system (ii) foreign crude oils unloaded at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port can
be transported north via the Capline and Chicap pipelines and into the Enbridge (Lakehead) mainline system at Mokena, near Chicago, IL (iii) US domestic crude grades can be transported north via the Capline System and/or the Enbridge Mid-Continent
(Ozark/Woodpat) system to Patoka, Illinois where they can be moved via the Chicap Pipeline into the Enbridge (Lakehead) Mainline system at Mokena, near Chicago, Illinois. We also receive US domestic crude (Bakken) and western Canadian crudes via
rail deliveries into Hamburg, NY where these volumes are trans-loaded and moved by truck to West Seneca, NY and into the Kiantone Pipeline.         
  The Kiantone Pipeline connects our West Seneca, New York terminal at the pipeline s northern terminus to the refinery s tank
farm at its southern terminus. We completed construction of the Kiantone Pipeline in 1971 and have operated it continuously since then. We are the sole shipper on the Kiantone Pipeline, and can currently transport up to 70,000 bpd along the
pipeline. Our right to maintain the pipeline is derived from approximately 265 separate easements, right-of-way agreements, licenses, permits, leases and similar agreements.   
        The pipeline operation is monitored by operators using a
recently upgraded Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) system. Shipments of crude arriving at the West Seneca terminal are separated and stored in one of the terminal s three storage tanks, which have an aggregate
storage capacity of 418,700 barrels. The refinery tank farm has four additional crude storage tanks with a total capacity of 499,000 barrels. An additional 35,000 barrels of crude can be stored at the refinery.   
         Refinery Turnarounds    
        Turnaround cycles vary for different refinery units. A
planned turnaround of each of the two major refinery units (the crude unit and the FCC) is conducted approximately every three to five years, during which time such units are shut down for internal inspection and repair. The next turnaround cycle is
planned for the fall of 2017.            We defer the cost
of major refinery units and tank turnarounds when incurred and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which ranges from 3 to 10 years. Thus, we charge costs to production over the period most clearly benefited by the
turnarounds.            The scheduled maintenance
turnarounds result in an inventory build of petroleum products to meet minimum sales demand during the maintenance shutdown period.

    Wholesale Marketing and Distribution             On a wholesale basis, our wholesale division sells gasoline, distillate and asphalt
products to distributor, commercial and government accounts and we sell propane to liquefied petroleum gas marketers. Our wholesale gasoline customer base includes branded dealer/distributor units operating under our proprietary Keystone      and Kwik Fill      brand names and units operating under the
Citgo      brand pursuant to a license agreement granting us the right to use Citgo s applicable brand names,
trademarks and other forms of Citgo s identification. Approximately 20% of the gasoline stations within this network are branded Citgo     .            In fiscal 2016, we sold on a wholesale basis approximately 48,600 bpd of gasoline, distillate and asphalt products to distributor, commercial, and government accounts. In addition, we sell approximately
1,000 bpd of propane to liquefied petroleum gas marketers. In fiscal year 2016, our production of gasoline, distillate, and asphalt sold at wholesale was 36%, 84%, and 100%, respectively. We sell all of our wholesale gasoline and distillate products
from our refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, and our Company-owned and operated product terminals.        
  We use a network of six terminals to store and distribute refined products. This network provides distillate and
asphalt storage capacities of approximately 1,225,000 barrels as of August 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, approximately 86% of our refined products were transported from the refinery via truck transports, with the remaining 14% transported by
rail. All gasoline product is stored at the refinery. The majority of our wholesale and retail gasoline distribution is handled by common carrier trucking companies at competitive rates. We also operate a fleet of eight tank trucks that supply
approximately 18% of our Kwik Fill      retail stations.            In fiscal 2016, our retail network sold approximately 64% of our gasoline production and approximately 16% of
our distillate production. The remaining 36% of gasoline production and 84% of distillate production was sold to wholesale customers.         
  Long-term dealer/distributor contracts accounted for approximately 12% of our wholesale gasoline sales in fiscal
2016. Supply contracts generally range from three to five years in length, with branded prices based on our prevailing wholesale rack price in Warren. Our wholesale gasoline customer base includes 46 branded dealer/distributor units operating
under our proprietary  Keystone       and  Kwik
Fill       brand names.        
  We distribute asphalt from the refinery by railcar or truck transport to end user contractors, in addition to re-supplying our asphalt
terminals. We own or lease terminals in Springdale and Dravosburg, Pennsylvania; Tonawanda and Oswego, New York; and Cordova, Alabama.         
  We believe that the location of our refinery provides us with a transportation cost advantage over our competitors, which is significant
within an approximately 100-mile radius of our refinery. For example, in Buffalo, New York over our last five fiscal years, including fiscal 2016, we have experienced an approximately 3.34 cents per gallon transportation cost advantage over those
competitors who are required to ship gasoline by pipeline and truck from New York Harbor sources to Buffalo.        
  Our ability to market asphalt is critical to the performance of our refinery. Crude oil scheduling and a consistent marketing effort
enables the refinery to process lower cost higher sulfur content crude oils, which in turn affords us higher refining margins. Sales of paving asphalt generally occur during the period May 1 through October 31 based on weather conditions.
In order to maximize our in season asphalt sales, we increase our asphalt storage capacity through the lease of outside terminals. Partially mitigating the seasonality of the asphalt paving business is our ability to sell asphalt year-round to
roofing shingle manufacturers. In fiscal year 2016, we sold 7.8 million barrels of asphalt.            We have a significant share of the asphalt market in southwestern New York and western and central Pennsylvania as well as in the greater metro areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Rochester and Buffalo,
New

York. We distribute asphalt from the refinery by railcar and truck transport to our owned and leased asphalt terminals in such cities or their suburbs. Asphalt can be purchased or exchanged in
the Gulf Coast area and delivered by barge to third party or Company-owned terminals near Pittsburgh.         
  Product distribution costs to both retail and wholesale accounts are minimized through product exchanges. Through these exchanges and
purchasing third party barrels, we have access to product supplies at 17 sources located throughout our marketing area. We seek to minimize retail distribution costs through the use of a system wide distribution model.   
         Retail Operations    
        As of August 31, 2016, 167 of our
retail units were located in New York, 175 in Pennsylvania and 12 in Ohio. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill     , Citgo      and Keystone      brand names and grocery items under the Red Apple Food Mart      and Country Fair      brand
names. We believe that Red Apple Food Mart     , Kwik Fill     , Country Fair     , Keystone      and Citgo      are well-recognized names in our marketing areas. Approximately 20% of the gasoline stations within this network are branded Citgo      pursuant to a license agreement granting us the right to use Citgo s applicable brand names, trademarks and
other forms of Citgo s identification. In fiscal year 2016, approximately 64% of the refinery s gasoline production was sold through our retail network. In addition to gasoline, many retail units sell diesel fuel and all units sell
convenience and grocery items through convenience stores under the Red Apple Food Mart      and Country Fair      brand names. As of August 31, 2016, we operated 354 units, of which 190 units are owned, 104 units are leased, and
the remaining stores are operated under a management agreement. 107 are Quick Serve Restaurants ( QSRs ) including franchise operations and eight of the units are full-service truck stops. Customers may pay for purchases with credit
cards including our own Kwik Fill      credit card. In addition to this credit card, we maintain a fleet credit card
catering to regional truck and automobile fleets. Sales of convenience products, which tend to have constant margins throughout the year, have served to reduce the effects of the seasonality inherent in gasoline retail margins. We maintain a 59% /
41% split between sales at our rural and urban units, balancing the higher volumes and lower gross margins in urban areas. We believe that the Company s operation of our retail units provides us with a significant advantage over competitors
that operate wholly or partly through dealer arrangements because we have greater control over pricing and operating expenses.         
   Retail Marketing and Distribution          
  We classify our retail stores into four categories: convenience stores, limited gasoline stations, truck stop facilities, and other
stores. Convenience stores sell a wide variety of foods, snacks, cigarettes and beverages and also provide self-service gasoline. 107 of our 354 retail outlets include QSRs where food is prepared on the premises for retail sales and also
distribution to our other nearby units that do not have in-store delicatessens. Limited gasoline stations sell gasoline, cigarettes, oil and related car care products and provide full service for gasoline customers. Truckstop facilities sell
gasoline and diesel fuel on a self-service and full-service basis. All truckstops include either a full or mini convenience store.         
  Total merchandise sales for fiscal year 2016 were $282.6 million, with a gross profit of approximately $75.7 million. Gross margins on the
sale of convenience merchandise averaged 26.8% for fiscal 2016.            Merchandise Supply             Tripifoods, Buffalo, New York is our primary wholesale grocery supplier for our entire chain. During fiscal year 2016, we purchased approximately 74.6% of our convenience merchandise from this vendor.
Tripifoods supplies us with products including tobacco, candy, deli, grocery, health and beauty products, and sundry items. We also purchase coffee, dairy products, beer, soda, snacks, and novelty goods from direct store vendors for resale. We
annually review our suppliers  costs and services versus those of alternate suppliers. We believe that alternative sources of merchandise supply at competitive prices are readily available.

    Location Performance Tracking    
        We maintain a store tracking mechanism to collect operating
data including sales and inventory levels for our retail network. Data transmissions are made using personal computers, which are available at each location. Once verified, the data interfaces with a variety of retail accounting systems, which
support daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports. These different reports are then provided to both the field management and administrative personnel. Upon completion of a capital project, management tracks  before and after 
performance, to evaluate the return on investment which has resulted from the improvements.             Environmental Regulations              General             We are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to fuel quality, pollution control and protection of the environment, such as those governing releases of certain
materials to the air and water and the storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and clean-up of wastes located on land. As with the industry in general, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases the
overall cost of business, including capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities.        
   Gasoline, Diesel Fuel, and Heating Oil Manufacturing Standards             Mandatory fuel regulations will continue to affect our operations including renewable fuel obligations, and
future sulfur reductions.            Starting January 1,
2013, the Company became an  obligated party  under the United States Environmental Protection Agency s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and is required to satisfy its Renewable Volume Obligation ( RVO ) on an annual basis. To
meet the RVO, the Company s transportation fuels must either contain the approved renewable fuel components, or credits must be purchased to cover any shortfall. The Company has met it s RVO for 2015 and expects to also satisfy the
requirements for the calendar year 2016 without the purchase of credits, known as  RINs  (Renewable Identification Numbers). As the RFS program is currently structured, the RVO of all obligated parties will increase annually, while the
ability to incorporate increasing volumes of renewable fuel components into fuel products remains limited. This phenomenon, better known as the  blend wall , will be experienced throughout the industry and is expected to present challenges
in future years. We will also continue to monitor proposals to amend the RFS to address the blend wall issue and evaluate its effect on future operations.        
  Effective July 1, 2012 the State of New York mandated that all heating oil sold in the state contain no more than 15 parts per million
(ppm) sulfur. Pennsylvania has also lowered the sulfur content maximum starting July 1, 2016 from 5,000 ppm to 500 ppm. We are complying with both New York and Pennsylvania mandates.            The USEPA has finalized the Tier 3 gasoline regulation which calls for a further reduction in the average
yearly sulfur content below the existing Tier 2 sulfur standard. The regulations consist of reducing the refinery annual average maximum sulfur content from 30 ppm to 10 ppm. In the  Final Rule  there is a three-year exemption for Small
Volume Refineries, which would include the Company, giving us a 2020 effective date rather than 2017. The current estimate to modify the refinery process to meet this new requirement is approximately $4 million.   
        Over the past five years we have maintained compliance with
the benzene standard that is part of the Mobile Source Air Toxics Rule No. 2 (MSAT II). We expect to use previously purchased 2013 vintage benzene credits for the 2016 compliance year. Benzene credits are valid for five years.   
        We are also monitoring closely all climate change and
Greenhouse Gas ( GHG ) legislation. We believe, however, that implementation of reasonable, incremental changes over time will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or operations. GHG
reduction mandates and their effect on our business are, however, unknown until all aspects of the programs are final and implementing regulations are available.

    Retail Gasoline Stations             We currently operate gasoline stations in three states with underground petroleum product storage tanks and in
the past have operated gasoline stations that are now closed. Federal and state statutes and regulations govern the installation, operation and removal from service of these underground storage tanks and associated piping and product dispensing
systems. The operation of underground storage tanks and systems carries the risk of contamination to soil and groundwater with petroleum products. We manage this risk by promptly responding to actual and suspected leaks and spills and implementing
remedial action plans meeting regulatory requirements. In addition to prompt response and remediation, we receive reimbursement for response costs associated with leaks and spills in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the Underground Storage
Tank Indemnification Fund.             Competition    
        Our primary market area is western New York and northwestern
Pennsylvania and our core market area encompasses our Warren County base and the eight contiguous counties in New York and Pennsylvania. The principal competitive factors affecting our wholesale marketing business are the price and quality of our
products, as well as the reliability and availability of supply and the location of multiple distribution points.         
  Petroleum refining is highly competitive. With respect to wholesale gasoline and distillate sales, we compete with P.E.S., P.B.F., Valero,
Exxon-Mobil, and other refiners and marketers via the pipeline system. We primarily compete with Marathon Petroleum in the asphalt market, both in New York and Pennsylvania. Many of our principal competitors are integrated multinational oil
companies that are substantially larger and better known than us. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, larger capitalization and greater resources, these major oil companies may be better able to withstand volatile market
conditions, compete on the basis of price and more readily obtain crude oil in times of shortages.            The principal competitive factors affecting our refining operations are crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs.
Certain of our larger competitors have refineries, which are larger and more complex and, as a result, could have lower per barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. We have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in exploration. We
believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future.         
  It is our view that the high construction costs and the stringent regulatory requirements inherent in petroleum refinery operations make
it uneconomical for new competing refineries to be constructed in our primary market area. The nearest fuels refinery is over 160 miles from Warren, Pennsylvania and we believe that no significant production from such refinery is currently shipped
into our primary market area.            The principal
competitive factors affecting our retail marketing network are location, product price, overall appearance and cleanliness of stores and brand identification. Competition from large, integrated oil companies, supermarkets, and  big box 
convenience store chains such as Wal-Mart and Sam s Club, is expected to be ongoing. The principal competitive factors affecting our wholesale marketing business are the price and quality of our products, as well as the reliability and
availability of supply and the location of multiple distribution points.             Employees             As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,266 employees; 1,951 full-time and 2,315 part-time employees. Approximately 3,698 persons were employed at our retail operations, 361 persons at our refinery,
Kiantone Pipeline and at terminals operated by us, with the remainder at our office in Warren, Pennsylvania. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with International Union of Operating Engineers Local No. 95, United Steel Workers of
America Local No. 2122-A and General Teamsters Local Union No. 397 covering 247, 6, and 21 employees, respectively. The agreements expire on February 1, 2022, January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2018, respectively. We believe that our relationship
with our employees is good.

    Intellectual Property    
        We own various federal and state
service and trademarks used by us, including Kwik Fill     ,
United     , Country Fair     , SuperKwik     , Keystone     , SubFare      and PizzaFare     . Our
subsidiary, Country Fair, and we have licensing agreements with Citgo Petroleum Corporation ( Citgo ) for the right to use Citgo s applicable brand names, trademarks and other forms of Citgo s identification for petroleum
products purchased under a distributor franchise agreement.            We have obtained the right to use the Red Apple Food Mart      service
mark to identify our retail units under a royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable license from Red Apple Supermarkets, Inc., a corporation which is indirectly wholly owned by John A. Catsimatidis, the indirect sole stockholder, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The license is for an indefinite term. The licensor has the right to terminate this license in the event that we fail to maintain quality acceptable to the licensor. We license the right to use the
Keystone      trademark to approximately 38 independent distributors on a non-exclusive royalty-free basis.
           We currently do not own any material patents.
Management believes that the Company does not infringe upon the patent rights of others, nor does our lack of patent ownership impact our business in any material manner.   
         Governmental Approvals    
        We believe we have obtained all necessary governmental
approvals, licenses, and permits to operate the refinery and convenience stores.             Enbridge Agreements             On July 31, 2014, URC and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation (together the  Company Parties ), on the one hand, and Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership ( EEPL ) and Enbridge Pipelines
Inc. ( EPI  and, together with EEPL, the  Carriers ), on the other hand, entered into a letter agreement (the  Letter Agreement ) with respect to approximately 88.85 miles of pipeline owned by the Carriers, which
transports crude oil from Canada to the Company s Kiantone Pipeline in West Seneca, New York and serves the Company s refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania ( Line 10 ).            Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to fund certain integrity costs necessary to maintain Line
10 (the  Integrity Costs ). The Carriers actual expenses with respect to the integrity maintenance and costs will be recorded against Integrity Costs paid for any subsequent year, as well as against any Replacement Costs, which are
defined and discussed below. The Integrity Costs for calendar year 2016 totaled $13.7 million and was paid in January 2016.        
  In addition, the Company agreed to pay for half the cost of replacing certain portions of Line 10 in accordance with a plan agreed to
between the Company Parties and the Carriers. The Company will pay 50% of the estimated expenses of the replacement project for each segment of Line 10 to be replaced (the  Replacement Costs ) within 30 days of its receipt of an invoice
for the same, along with a project management fee of 2.25%. Each Carrier will initially fund the remaining 50% of the Replacement Costs during construction, provided that the Company will reimburse the Carriers for their actual cost of funds during
the construction process. Once construction is complete and each replaced segment of Line 10 is put into service, and assuming the Company has not exercised its rights to purchase Line 10 pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement (as defined and
discussed below), the Company will repay the Carriers the 50% of the Replacement Costs they funded over a 10-year period. On November 12, 2015, the Company made a payment to the Carriers in the amount of $53.7 million for Replacement Costs, which
amount reflects net credits received by the Company upon reconciliation of the Integrity Costs funded in fiscal 2014.        
  On April 8, 2015 (the  Execution Date ), the Company entered into the Put and Call Option Agreement with each of the Enbridge LP
(the  U.S. Agreement ) and Enbridge Inc (the  Canadian Agreement , and together   
         11   

Table of Contents  

with the U.S. Agreement, the  Put and Call Options Agreement ), which agreements are substantially similar. Pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement; the Company was granted a right to
purchase and the Company gave the Carriers a right to put to the Company the Carriers  assignable permits related to the ownership and operation of Line 10, as well as personal property, contract rights, records and incidental rights held
solely in connection with Line 10 (collectively, the  Assets ).            The Carrier s Put Option is exercisable beginning on the date that is the earlier of (a) January 1, 2026 and (b) the date that is 30 days after the latest of (i) the date on which the Carriers give
notice that the Line 10 replacement work performed pursuant to the Letter Agreement is sufficiently completed (as contemplated in the Call and Put Agreement) and (ii) the ninth (9   th   ) anniversary of the Execution Date (the  Put Option Commencement Date ). The Put Option terminates on
the date that is 24 months after either (a) the Put Option Commencement Date if such date is the first of a month or (b) the first day of the calendar month immediately following the Put Option Commencement Date if it is not the first day of the
month (the  Put/Call Option Expiry Date ). The Company s Call Option is exercisable at any time beginning on the Execution Date and ending on the Put/Call Option Expiry Date.   
        The Company considered whether the Put and Call Agreement
should be separated from the host contract in accordance with ASC 815 embedded derivative guidance and concluded that it doesn t meet the criteria for separation. The Company determined that the Put and Call Agreement is interdependent with the
Line l0 Agreement, and therefore is not freestanding and is accounted for as part of the Line 10 Agreement. As such we concluded that there is no separate accounting impact of the Put and Call Agreement until it becomes probable that it will be
exercised. As of August 31, 2016 the Company or the Carrier have not exercised their rights under the Put and Call Agreement.         
  On August 31, 2016, Enbridge held approximately $60.1 million in U.S. funds and $12.9 million in Canadian funds from payments made by the
Company which are on deposit for future use.             Financing
            On October 20, 2015 (the  Closing
Date ), URC, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, Kiantone Pipeline Corporation ( Kiantone ), United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (collectively, the
 Borrowers ) entered into an Amended, Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the
 Agent ), and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated May 18, 2011 and last amended June 18, 2013, by and between the Company
and certain subsidiaries and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the  Existing Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement will terminate on October 19, 2020 (the  Expiration Date ). Until the
Expiration Date, the Company may borrow on the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.        
  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to
$225,000,000 (the  New Revolving Credit Facility ). The New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing
lenders agree to increase their commitments or additional lenders commit to fund such increase. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on
the Closing Date ( Term Loan  and, together with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the  Credit Obligations ). The Term Loan shall be paid in full on or prior to the Expiration Date and shall be paid in equal quarterly
amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule. Prepayment of the Term Loan in whole or in part may be made at any time without premium or penalty.   
        The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority
security interest in certain cash accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the
security interest in the refinery and the equity interests in Kiantone shall be released.

   The Credit Agreement requires minimum undrawn availability of $15,000,000 at all times prior
to the repayment of the Term Loan and the greater of 12.5% of the maximum New Revolving Credit Facility or $25,000,000 after the repayment of the Term Loan. Upon the repayment of the Term Loan, the Company is required to maintain a consolidated net
worth of no less than $100,000,000. The Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including in connection with non-ordinary course asset sales, equity issuances and the incurrence of additional debt. Unless assets
sold in non-ordinary course transactions were included in the borrowing base for the New Revolving Credit Facility, mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to the repayment of the Term Loan and then the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit
Agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, covenants related to the fixed charge coverage ratio, payment of fees, conduct of business, maintenance of existence and assets, payment of
indebtedness and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, intercompany obligations, affiliate transactions, amendments to organizational documents, and financial statements.   
        The proceeds of the Credit Agreement were used to (i)
refinance the Company s existing senior debt under the Existing Credit Facility (ii) repay and satisfy in full those certain 10.500% senior secured notes due 2018 (the  Senior Secured Notes due 2018 ), (iii) provide for the
Company s general corporate needs, including working capital requirements and capital expenditures and (iv) pay the fees and expenses associated with the Credit Agreement.  
        On October 6, 2015, the Company announced the commencement of
a tender offer (the  Tender Offer ) to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding $237,250,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 and a solicitation of consents for proposed amendments to the
related indenture (the  Consent Solicitation ). The Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation was made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated October 6, 2015 and related consent and letter of
transmittal. The Tender Offer was set to expire on November 2, 2015 (the  Expiration Date ). Holders of Senior Secured Notes due 2018 that validly tendered prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 19, 2015 (the  consent
deadline ), would receive total consideration of $1,057.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which included a consent payment of $30.00. Holders that tender after the consent
deadline and prior to the Expiration Date would receive total consideration of $1,027.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.         
  On October 20, 2015, the Company announced that $217,871,000 aggregate principal amount, or 91.83% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018,
were validly tendered prior to the consent deadline. The Company also received the requisite consents for the proposed amendments to eliminate most of the covenants applicable to the Senior Secured Notes due 2018, including the release of the
collateral securing the Notes. The remaining 8.17% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 or $19,379,000, were fully redeemed at a redemption price of 105.25% of par value plus accrued interest of $452,177 on November 19, 2015.   
        On December 9, 2015, United Refining Company of New York Inc.
(as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a Loan Agreement with a bank, in the amount of $50,000,000 which matures on December 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, interest is calculated as

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS.            
   Risks Relating to the Business          
   The price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products and fuel and utility services may have a material
adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.             Our refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and natural gas
liquids that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we are able to sell refined products. Refining is primarily a margin-based business and, to increase earnings, it is important to maximize the yields of high value finished
products while minimizing the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs contracts, our earnings, and cash flows are negatively affected. Refining margins
historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services. While an increase
or decrease in the price of crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes
in crude oil prices on our refining margins therefore depends in part on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes.         
  In addition, the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial refined product inventories. Because refined products are
commodities, we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Our refined product inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ), inventory valuation methodology. If
the market value of our refined product inventory were to decline to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of sales.            Prices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control,
including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, asphalt and other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:         

changes in global and local economic conditions;      

domestic and foreign demand for fuel products, especially in the United States, China and India;      

worldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, West Africa and Latin America;

the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the volume of crude oil, feedstock and refined products imported
into the United States;            

availability of and access to transportation infrastructure;      

utilization rates of U.S. refineries;            

the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to affect oil prices and maintain production
controls;            

development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;      
         14   

Table of Contents  

commodities speculation;            

natural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause
unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refinery;            

federal and state government regulations and taxes; and      

local factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.
              Our direct operating expense
structure also impacts our earnings. Our major direct operating expenses include employee and contract labor, maintenance and energy costs. Our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of fuel and other
utility services. The volatility in costs of fuel, principally natural gas, and other utility services, principally electricity, used by our refinery and other operations affect our operating costs. Fuel and utility prices have been, and will
continue to be, affected by factors outside our control, such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile and, typically, electricity prices fluctuate with
natural gas prices. Future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flows.         
  Volatility in refined product prices also affects our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. A decline in prices of our
refined products reduces the value of our refined product inventory collateral, which, in turn, may reduce the amount available for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility.             Our results of operations are affected by crude oil differentials, which may fluctuate substantially.
            Our results of operations are affected by
crude oil differentials, which may fluctuate substantially.            We are subject to interruptions of supply and distribution as a result of our reliance on pipelines for our supply of crude oil. Prolonged disruption to the Enbridge Pipeline or the Kiantone Pipeline
may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.          
  Our refinery receives substantially all of its crude oil through pipelines. We could experience an interruption of supply, or an increased
cost of receiving crude oil, if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or blendstocks is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, other third party action or any of the types of events
described in the preceding risk factor.           We obtain
substantially all of our crude oil supply through pipelines owned and operated by Enbridge Energy Partners ( Enbridge Pipeline ), and the Kiantone Pipeline, which we own and operate. Any prolonged disruption to the operations of our
refinery, the Enbridge Pipeline or the Kiantone Pipeline, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to such facilities, severe weather conditions, interruption of utilities service or other reasons, or our default under the
Enbridge Agreement, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, our property and business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for any losses that occur.   
        In addition, due to the common carrier regulatory obligation
applicable to interstate oil pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in accordance with the tariff then in effect in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity. Therefore, nominations by new shippers or
increased nominations by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us with respect to the Enbridge Pipeline system. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for
transportation of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, as a result, our ability to make distributions.   
         15

    The dangers inherent in our operations could cause disruptions and could expose us to
potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities and reduce our liquidity. We are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single facility.    
        Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks
inherent in refining operations and in transporting and storing crude oil, intermediate products and refined products. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures and spills, third
party interference and mechanical failure of equipment at our facilities, any of which could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, pollution (such as oil spills, etc.), personal injury or wrongful death claims and other
damage to our properties and the property of others.            There is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in the normal course of operations and following unforeseen events. In such situations, undamaged refinery processing units may be
dependent on, or interact with, damaged process units and, accordingly, are also subject to being shut down.         
  Because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single refinery, any of such events at our refinery could significantly disrupt
our production and distribution of refined products. Any sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, as a result, our ability to make distributions.
            Our suppliers source substantially all of our
crude oil from Canada and the northern plain states and may experience interruptions of supply from those regions.          
  Our suppliers source substantially all of our crude oil from Canada and the northern plain states. As a result, we may be
disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from those regions caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant
governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in those areas.   
         Competition from companies having greater financial and
other resources than we do could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.          
  Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in the PADD I region of the United States, as well as with domestic
refiners in other PADD regions and foreign refiners that import products into the United States. In addition, we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements
of our industrial, commercial and individual customers. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries, and may be able to realize lower per-barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal
competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain
substantially all of our feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of crude
oil supply and other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations.            Newer or upgraded refineries will often be more efficient than our refinery, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. While we have taken significant measures to maintain and upgrade units in our
refinery by installing new equipment and repairing equipment to improve our operations, these actions involve significant uncertainties, since upgraded equipment may not perform at expected throughput levels, the yield and product quality of new
equipment may differ from design specifications and modifications may be needed to correct equipment that does not perform as expected. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment or repaired equipment could lead to
lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions. Over time, our refinery may become obsolete, or be unable to compete, because of the
construction of new, more efficient facilities by our competitors.

    We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply
with, environmental, health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently.             Our refinery and pipelines operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, treatment and transportation of petroleum and
hazardous substances, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations
are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. Compliance with the complex array of federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety is difficult and likely
will require us to make significant expenditures. Moreover, our business is inherently subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment including at neighboring areas or third party
storage, treatment or disposal facilities. Certain environmental laws impose joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct in connection with the investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or
releases. As such, we may be required to pay more than our fair share of such investigation or cleanup. We may not be able to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits at all times.
Violations of applicable legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions and/or facility shutdowns. We may also be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur
increased operating costs or change operations to achieve compliance with applicable standards.            We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be
administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. For example, on June 1,
2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued final amendments to the New Source Performance Standards ( NSPS ) for petroleum refineries, including standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides from process heaters
and work practice standards and monitoring requirements for flares. We have evaluated these regulations and amended standards, as may be applicable to the flare, process heaters and operations at our refinery. The flare monitoring project required
under NSPS Subpart Ja has been completed for a cost of approximately $1.6 million and is fully operational. The Industrial Boiler Heater MACT became effective in January 2016; no control equipment or modifications were required to meet compliance.
The Refinery Risk Sector Rule, modifications to the Risk Management Program (RMP), the PADEP required Reasonable Available Control Technology 2 rule (RACT 2) and the PADEP State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for SO2 non-attainment are new
requirements that are applicable to the refinery. Cost of these new requirements are not expected to be material. In addition, the EPA has announced new  Tier 3  motor vehicle emission and fuel standards. These regulations lower the
maximum average sulfur content of gasoline from 30 parts per million to 10 parts per million. This project has been developed and costs are projected to be approximately $4 million to make necessary upgrades to produce Tier 3 compliant gasoline. We
may at some point in the future be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur materially increased operating costs to comply with the new standards. Expenditures or costs for environmental, health and safety compliance could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability and, as a result, our ability to make distributions.         
   Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.    
        We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including
federal, state and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that
could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. There can be no certainty of the effect that increases in taxes, or imposition of new taxes, could have on us, or whether such taxes would be passed on to our customers.
Certain of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority, which could increase our tax liabilities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and
penalties.

    A decrease in government funding for paving activity could lead to a decrease in demand
for asphalt, which could materially adversely affect refining margins.             In fiscal 2016, asphalt sales represented 15% of our total revenues. Over the same period, approximately 89% of our asphalt was produced for use in paving or repaving roads and highways. The level of
paving activity is, in turn, dependent upon funding available from federal, state and local governments. Funding for paving has been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by budget difficulties at the federal, state or local
levels. A decrease in demand for asphalt could cause us to sell asphalt at significantly lower prices or to curtail production of asphalt by processing more costly lower sulfur content crude oil which would adversely affect refining margins.
            We have an indirect controlling stockholder.
            John A. Catsimatidis indirectly owns all of
our outstanding voting stock. By virtue of such stock ownership, Mr. Catsimatidis has the power to control all matters submitted to our stockholder and to elect all of our directors.             Our pension plans are currently underfunded.             Substantially all of our employees are covered by three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. As of
August 31, 2016, as measured under ASC 715 (which is not the same as the measure used for purposes of calculating required contributions and potential liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC), the aggregate accumulated benefit
obligation under our pension plans was approximately $140.9 million and the value of the assets of the plans was approximately $92.5 million. In fiscal 2016, we contributed $4.8 million to the three plans, and we have made additional contributions
to our pension plans of $.9 million in fiscal year 2017. If the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our contributions for future years could be higher
than we expect.            Our pension plans are subject to
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under ERISA, the PBGC generally has the authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan if the possible long-run loss of the PBGC with respect to the plan may reasonably be
expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated. In the event our pension plans are terminated for any reason while the plans are underfunded, we will incur a liability to the PBGC that may be equal to the entire amount of the
underfunding.             The Credit Agreement contains
certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur certain additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue our business strategies.    
        The Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive
covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability, among other things, to:   

incur, assume or guarantee additional debt or issue redeemable stock or preferred stock;      

make distributions or prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;            

enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;      

incur liens;            

sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;      

enter into new lines of business;            

enter into transactions with affiliates; and      

merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets.      
         18

   A breach of the covenants under the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default
under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of
default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our
Credit Agreement, those creditors could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, including the refinery.         
  In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that
indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:         

limited in how we conduct our business;            

unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or      

unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.      
         The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the
Company, including the Refinery, and a foreclosure on such liens could adversely affect our business.          
  The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets, including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiary Kiantone Pipeline
Corporation and a mortgage lien on and a security interest in the assets comprising the refinery. In case of a continuing event of default by the Company, the collateral agent may exercise all rights of a mortgagee and/or secured party under
applicable law, including, without limitation, transferring to itself or a nominee title to such collateral, which could adversely affect our business.

   PROPERTIES.            
  We own a 107-acre site in Warren, Pennsylvania upon which we operate our refinery. The site also contains an office building housing our
principal executive office.            We own various real
property in the states of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Alabama, upon which, as of August 31, 2016, we operated 190 retail units and two crude oil and six refined product storage terminals. We also own the 78-mile long Kiantone Pipeline, a
pipeline which connects our crude oil storage terminal to the refinery s tank farm. Our right to maintain the pipeline is derived from approximately 265 separate easements, right-of-way agreements, leases, permits, and similar agreements. We
also have easements, right-of-way agreements, leases, permits, and similar agreements that would enable us to build a second pipeline on property contiguous to the Kiantone Pipeline. We also own a partially completed 50 million gallon per year
biodiesel facility in Brooklyn, New York.            As of
August 31, 2016, we also lease an aggregate of 163 sites in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio upon which we operate retail units.

   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.            
  The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their
respective business operations. These proceedings include various administrative actions relating to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as well as civil matters before various courts seeking money damages. The Company
believes that if the legal proceedings in which it is currently

         Business Strategy and Overview    
        Our primary business objective is to strengthen our position
as a leading producer and marketer of high quality refined petroleum products within our market area. We plan to accomplish this strategy through continued attention to optimizing our operations, resulting in the lowest possible operating costs, and
continuing to improve and enhance our retail and wholesale positions. More specifically, we intend to:         

Maximize the favorable economic impact of our transportation cost advantage by increasing our retail and wholesale market shares within our market
area.            

Optimize profitability by managing feedstock costs, product yields, and inventories through our refinery feedstock management program and our
system-wide distribution model. We seek to maximize refinery profitability by selecting crude oil and other feedstocks taking into account product demand and pricing in our market areas, price, quality and availability of various grades of crude
oil, product inventory levels and planned turnarounds of refinery units for maintenance. The combination of these factors is optimized by a sophisticated proprietary linear programming computer model, which selects the most profitable feedstock and
product mix. The linear programming model is continuously updated and improved to reflect changes in the product market place and in our refinery s processing capability.      

Continue to investigate strategic acquisitions.      

Develop high payback discretionary capital improvements to our existing facilities.      
         Critical Accounting Policies    
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements and
supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item
8. Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different financial
results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include:             Revenue Recognition    
        Revenues for products sold by the wholesale segment are
recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, at which time title to those products is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. At no point do we recognize revenue from the sale of product
prior to transfer of its title. Title to product is transferred to the customer at the shipping point, under predetermined contracts for sale at agreement upon or posted prices to customers of which collectability is reasonably assured.  
         22   

Table of Contents  

   Revenues for products sold by the retail segment are recognized immediately upon sale to the
customer. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges are recognized when the related product revenue is recognized.         
   Collectability of Accounts Receivable          
  For accounts receivable, we estimate the net collectability considering both historical and anticipated trends relating to our customers
and the possibility of non-collection due to their financial position. While such non-collections have been historically within our expectations and the allowances the Company has established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to
experience non-collection rates that it has experienced in the past. A significant change in the financial position of our customers could have a material impact on the quality of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.   
         Goodwill and Other Non-Amortizable Assets    
        In accordance with ACS 350, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. We assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually.            The Company performed separate impairment tests on June 1, 2016 for its tradename and other intangible assets
using discounted and undiscounted cash flow methods, respectively. The fair value of the tradename and other intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The Company has noted no subsequent indication that would require testing the
tradename and intangible assets for impairment.         
  There were no material changes in the gross carrying amounts of goodwill, tradename, or other intangible assets for fiscal 2016.
            Long-Lived Assets    
        Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of any of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company will assess the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow forecasts. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written
down to fair value.             Value of Pension Assets
            The Company maintains three noncontributory
defined benefit retirement plans for substantially all its employees. The assets of the plans are invested with a financial institution that follows an investment policy drafted by the Company. The investment guidelines provide a percentage range
for each class of assets to be managed by the financial institution. The historic performance of these asset classes supports the Company s expected return on the assets. The asset classes are rebalanced periodically should they fall outside
the range allocations.            The percentage of total
asset allocation range is as follows:         
          The discount rate utilized in
valuing the benefit obligations of the plans was derived from the rate of return on high quality bonds as of August 31, 2016. Similarly, the rate of compensation utilizes historic increases granted by the Company and the industry as well as
future compensation policies. See Note 9 to  Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 .   
         23

    Environmental Remediation and Litigation Reserve Estimations    
        Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording
liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation. Liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the effect of additional information on the
extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. Likewise, actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstance and application of laws in individual cases.   
        The above assessment of critical accounting policies is not
meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that occur from the application of the full range of the Company s accounting policies. Materially different financial results could occur in the application of
other accounting policies as well. Likewise, materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards promulgated by the various rule-making bodies.   
         General             The Company is engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. In fiscal 2016, approximately 64%
and 16% of the Company s gasoline and distillate production, respectively, was sold through the Company s network of service stations and truck stops. The balances of the Company s refined products were sold to wholesale customers. In
addition to transportation and heating fuels, primarily gasoline and distillate, the Company is a major regional wholesale marketer of asphalt. The Company also sells convenience merchandise at convenience stores located at most of its service
stations. The Company s profitability is influenced by fluctuations in the market prices of crude oils and refined products. Although the Company s product sales mix helps to reduce the impact of large short-term variations in crude oil
price, net sales and costs of goods sold can fluctuate widely based upon fluctuations in crude oil prices. Specifically, the margins on wholesale gasoline and distillate tend to decline in periods of rapidly declining crude oil prices, while margins
on asphalt, retail gasoline and distillate tend to improve. During periods of rapidly rising crude oil prices, margins on wholesale gasoline and distillate tend to improve, while margins on asphalt and retail gasoline and distillate tend to decline.
Gross margins on the sale of convenience merchandise averaged 26.8% for fiscal 2016 and have been between 25.2% and 26.8% for the last five years and are essentially unaffected by variations in crude oil and petroleum products prices.  
        On March 6, 2013, the Company, through its subsidiary United
Biofuels, Inc. ( UBI ), acquired a partially completed 50 million gallon per year biodiesel facility in Brooklyn, New York as part of the acquisition by its parent company, United Refining, Inc., of certain assets of Metro Fuel Oil Corp,
and its affiliates. UBI has initiated the project to complete and modify the biodiesel plant. Commissioning the modified biodiesel plant is expected during fiscal 2018. The remaining cost of the project is expected to be about $37 million.
           The Company includes in costs of goods sold
operating expenses incurred in the refining process. Therefore, operating expenses reflect only selling, general and administrative expenses, including all expenses of the retail network, and depreciation and amortization.   
         Recent Developments    
        The Company continues to be impacted by the volatility in
petroleum markets in fiscal year 2016. From August 31, 2016 prices for NYMEX WTI crude have varied in a range from $44.70 on August 31, 2016 to $51.60 during October and settled at $46.06 on November 25, 2016. The lagged 3-2-1 crackspread
as measured by the difference between the price of crude oil contracts traded on the NYMEX for the preceding month to the prices of NYMEX gasoline and heating oil contracts in the current trading month, have been negatively affected through
October. The Company uses a lagged crackspread as a margin indicator as it reflects the time period between the purchase of crude oil and its delivery to the refinery for processing. Through November 25, 2016 the indicated lagged average
crackspread for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $13.91.

   The Company has reached an early settlement agreement with its refinery employees
represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 95. The contract is effective February 1, 2017 and expires February 1, 2022.         
   Financing          
  On October 20, 2015 (the  Closing Date ), URC, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, Kiantone Pipeline Corporation
( Kiantone ), United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (collectively, the  Borrowers ) entered into an Amended, Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term
Loan and Security Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the  Agent ), and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit
Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated May 18, 2011 and last amended June 18, 2013, by and between the Company and certain subsidiaries and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the
 Existing Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement will terminate on October 19, 2020 (the  Expiration Date ). Until the Expiration Date, the Company may borrow on the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on
a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.           Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to $225,000,000 (the  New Revolving Credit Facility ). The
New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their commitments or additional lenders commit to
fund such increase. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on the Closing Date ( Term Loan  and, together with the New Revolving
Credit Facility, the  Credit Obligations ). The Term Loan shall be paid in full on or prior to the Expiration Date and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule. Prepayment of the
Term Loan in whole or in part may be made at any time without premium or penalty.            The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the Refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of
Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the security interest in the refinery and the equity interests in Kiantone shall be released.           The Credit Agreement requires minimum undrawn availability of $15,000,000 at all times prior to the repayment
of the Term Loan and the greater of 12.5% of the maximum New Revolving Credit Facility or $25,000,000 after the repayment of the Term Loan. Upon the repayment of the Term Loan, the Company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of no less
than $100,000,000. The Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including in connection with non-ordinary course asset sales, equity issuances and the incurrence of additional debt. Unless assets sold in non-ordinary
course transactions were included in the borrowing base for the New Revolving Credit Facility, mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to the repayment of the Term Loan and then the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement also
includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, covenants related to the fixed charge coverage ratio, payment of fees, conduct of business, maintenance of existence and assets, payment of indebtedness and the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, intercompany obligations, affiliate transactions, amendments to organizational documents, and financial statements.         
  The proceeds of the Credit Agreement were used to (i) refinance the Company s existing senior debt under the Existing Credit Facility
(ii) provide for the Company s general corporate needs, including working capital requirements and capital expenditures, (iii) repay and satisfy in full those certain 10.500% senior secured notes due 2018 (the  Senior Secured Notes due
2018 ) and (iv) pay the fees and expenses associated with the Credit Agreement.

   On October 6, 2015, the Company announced the commencement of a tender offer (the
 Tender Offer ) to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding $237,250,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 and a solicitation of consents for proposed amendments to the related indenture
(the  Consent Solicitation ). The Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation was made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated October 6, 2015 and related consent and letter of transmittal. The Tender
Offer was set to expire on November 2, 2015 (the  Expiration Date ). Holders of Senior Secured Notes due 2018 that validly tendered prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 19, 2015 (the  consent deadline ), would
receive total consideration of $1,057.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which included a consent payment of $30.00. Holders that tender after the consent deadline and prior to
the Expiration Date would receive total consideration of $1,027.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.         
  On October 20, 2015, the Company announced that $217,871,000 aggregate principal amount, or 91.83% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018,
were validly tendered prior to the consent deadline. The Company also received the requisite consents for the proposed amendments to eliminate most of the covenants applicable to the Senior Secured Notes due 2018, including the release of the
collateral securing the Notes. The remaining 8.17% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 or $19,379,000, will be fully redeemed at a redemption price of 105.25% of par value plus accrued interest of $452,177 on November 19, 2015.   
        On December 9, 2015, United Refining Company of New York Inc.
(as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a Loan Agreement with a bank, in the amount of $50,000,000 which matures on December 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, interest is calculated as
follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the Fixed Rate. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 84 monthly
principal installments of approximately $129,000 with the remaining principal balance due on December 9, 2022. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and
contains various covenants applicable to the Borrower, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan are to
be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.            On October 20, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a loan agreement with a bank in the amount of $25,000,000 which matures on
October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the
greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83 monthly principal installments of approximately $83,000 with the remaining principal balance due on October 20, 2023. The Loan is secured
by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and contains various covenants applicable to the Borrower, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments
due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan are to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.   
         Enbridge Agreements    
        On July 31, 2014, URC and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation
(together the  Company Parties ), on the one hand, and Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership ( EEPL ) and Enbridge Pipelines Inc. ( EPI  and, together with EEPL, the  Carriers ), on the other hand, entered into
a letter agreement (the  Letter Agreement ) with respect to approximately 88.85 miles of pipeline owned by the Carriers, which transports crude oil from Canada to the Company s Kiantone Pipeline in West Seneca, New York and serves the
Company s refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania ( Line 10 ).   
         26   

Table of Contents  

   Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to fund certain integrity costs
necessary to maintain Line 10 (the  Integrity Costs ). The Carriers actual expenses with respect to the integrity maintenance and costs will be recorded against Integrity Costs paid for any subsequent year, as well as against any
Replacement Costs, which are defined and discussed below. The Integrity Costs for calendar year 2016 totaled $13.7 million and was paid in January 2016.        
  In addition, the Company agreed to pay for half the cost of replacing certain portions of Line 10 in accordance with a plan agreed to
between the Company Parties and the Carriers. The Company will pay 50% of the estimated expenses of the replacement project for each segment of Line 10 to be replaced (the  Replacement Costs ) within 30 days of its receipt of an invoice
for the same, along with a project management fee of 2.25%. Each Carrier will initially fund the remaining 50% of the Replacement Costs during construction, provided that the Company will reimburse the Carriers for their actual cost of funds during
the construction process. Once construction is complete and each replaced segment of Line 10 is put into service, and assuming the Company has not exercised its rights to purchase Line 10 pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement (as defined and
discussed below), the Company will repay the Carriers the 50% of the Replacement Costs they funded over a 10-year period. On November 12, 2015, the Company made a payment to the Carriers in the amount of $53.7 million for Replacement Costs, which
amount reflects net credits received by the Company upon reconciliation of the Integrity Costs funded in fiscal 2014.        
  On April 8, 2015 (the  Execution Date ), the Company entered into the Put and Call Option Agreement with each of the Enbridge LP
(the  U.S. Agreement ) and Enbridge Inc (the  Canadian Agreement , and together with the U.S. Agreement, the  Put and Call Options Agreement ), which agreements are substantially similar. Pursuant to the Put and Call
Agreement; the Company was granted a right to purchase and the Company gave the Carriers a right to put to the Company the Carriers  assignable permits related to the ownership and operation of Line 10, as well as personal property, contract
rights, records and incidental rights held solely in connection with Line 10 (collectively, the  Assets ).         
  The Carrier s Put Option is exercisable beginning on the date that is the earlier of (a) January 1, 2026 and (b)
the date that is 30 days after the latest of (i) the date on which the Carriers give notice that the Line 10 replacement work performed pursuant to the Letter Agreement is sufficiently completed (as contemplated in the Call and Put Agreement) and
(ii) the ninth (9   th   ) anniversary of the Execution Date
(the  Put Option Commencement Date ). The Put Option terminates on the date that is 24 months after either (a) the Put Option Commencement Date if such date is the first of a month or (b) the first day of the calendar month
immediately following the Put Option Commencement Date if it is not the first day of the month (the  Put/Call Option Expiry Date ). The Company s Call Option is exercisable at any time beginning on the Execution Date and ending
on the Put/Call Option Expiry Date.            The Company
considered whether the Put and Call Agreement should be separated from the host contract in accordance with ASC 815 embedded derivative guidance and concluded that it doesn t meet the criteria for separation. The Company determined that the Put
and Call Agreement is interdependent with the Line l0 Agreement, and therefore is not freestanding and is accounted for as part of the Line 10 Agreement. As such we concluded that there is no separate accounting impact of the Put and Call Agreement
until it becomes probable that it will be exercised. As of August 31, 2016 the Company or the Carrier have not exercised their rights under the Put and Call Agreement.   
        On August 31, 2016, Enbridge held approximately $60.1 million
in U.S. funds and $12.9 million in Canadian funds   from payments made by the Company which are on deposit for future use.         
   Results of Operations          
  The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations
are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail.   
         27   

Table of Contents  

   The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil,
petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and industrial customers. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill     , Citgo      and Keystone      brand names at
a network of Company-operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through Company-owned gasoline stations and convenience stores under the Red Apple Food Mart      and Country Fair      brand
names.            A discussion and analysis of the factors
contributing to the Company s results of operations are presented below. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes (See Item 8), together with the following information, are intended to supply investors with a
reasonable basis for evaluating the Company s operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting the Company s future performance.         
   Retail Operations          

(a)  
  Includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our wholesale segment at prices which approximate market.     

(b)  
  Company management calculates petroleum margin per gallon by dividing petroleum gross profit by petroleum sales volumes. Management uses fuel margin per gallon
calculations to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. Petroleum margin per gallon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry.     
         Net Sales              2016 vs. 2015          
  Retail sales decreased during fiscal 2016 by $227.7 million or 16.9% for the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $1,347.3 million to
$1,119.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $233.5 million in petroleum sales offset by an increase of $5.8 million in merchandise sales. The petroleum sales decrease resulted from a 3.1 million gallon or .8% decrease in retail
petroleum volume and a 21.2% decrease in retail selling prices per gallon.             2015 vs. 2014             Retail sales decreased during fiscal 2015 by $341.2 million or 20.2% for the comparable period in fiscal 2014 from $1,688.5 million to $1,347.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of
$344.6 million   
         28   

Table of Contents  

in petroleum sales offset by an increase of $3.4 million in merchandise sales. The petroleum sales decrease resulted from a 13.0 million gallon or 3.3% decrease in retail petroleum volume and a
21.7% decrease in retail selling prices per gallon.             Costs of
Goods Sold              2016 vs. 2015    
        Retail costs of goods sold decreased during fiscal 2016 by
$204.3 million or 17.5% for the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $1,168.1 million to $963.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to $204.9 million decrease in petroleum volume and prices, $.1 million of freight costs and $.8 million in fuel
tax offset by an increase in merchandise cost of $1.5 million.            2015 vs. 2014             Retail costs of goods sold decreased during fiscal 2015 by $361.3 million or 23.6% for the comparable period in fiscal 2014 from $1,529.4 million to $1,168.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to
$370.1 million in petroleum volume and prices, and $.6 million of freight costs, offset by an increase in merchandise cost of $1.1 million and $8.3 million in fuel tax. This tax increase was due primarily to the increase in Pennsylvania fuels tax.
            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    
         2016 vs. 2015

( SG A ) expenses increased during fiscal 2016 by $3.9 million or 2.7% for the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $139.4 million to $143.3 million. The increase was due in part to an increase in payroll costs of $4.2 million,
environmental costs of $.4 million, promotion and advertising costs of $1.0 million and other costs of $.6 million offset by reductions of maintenance costs of $.2 million, credit costs of $1.8 million and legal and professional costs of $.3
million.             2015 vs. 2014    
        Retail Selling, General and Administrative
( SG A ) expenses increased during fiscal 2015 by $1.5 million or 1.1% for the comparable period in fiscal 2014 from $137.9 million to $139.4 million. The increase was due in part to an increase in payroll costs of $2.9 million,
environmental costs of $1.1 million and maintenance costs of $1.2 million offset by reductions in credit costs of $1.7 million, pension costs of $.8 million and other costs of $1.2 million.            Wholesale Operations

million or 29.4% for the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $1,369.4 million to $967.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to a 35.6% decrease in wholesale prices offset by an increase of 9.7% in wholesale volume.   
         2015 vs. 2014    
        Wholesale sales decreased during fiscal 2015 by $381.3
million or 21.8% for the comparable period in fiscal 2014 from $1,750.7 million to $1,369.4 million. The decrease was primarily due to a 27.2% decrease in wholesale prices offset by an increase of 7.4% in wholesale volume.   
         Costs of Goods Sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
             2016 vs. 2015

    2015 vs. 2014    
        Wholesale costs of goods sold decreased during fiscal 2015
by $387.1 million or 24.6% for the comparable period in fiscal 2014 from $1,571.0 million to $1,183.9 million. The decrease in wholesale costs of goods sold during this period was primarily due to a decrease in cost of raw materials.  
         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    
         2016 vs. 2015    
        Wholesale SG A expenses increased during fiscal 2016 by
$2.0 million or 7.9% for the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $25.6 million to $27.6 million. The increase was due in part to an increase in payroll costs of $1.0 million, credit costs of $.3 million, pension costs of $.2 million and other
costs of $.5 million.             2015 vs. 2014
            Wholesale SG A expenses remained
relatively constant during fiscal 2015 to the comparable period in fiscal 2014.             Consolidated Expenses:              Depreciation and Amortization              2016 vs. 2015             Depreciation and amortization increased during fiscal 2016 by $6.2 million for the comparable period for fiscal 2015 from $41.6 million to $47.8 million. This increase was due primarily to an increase in
turnaround amortization and integrity and replacement costs amortization.            2015 vs. 2014             Depreciation and amortization increased during fiscal 2015 by $9.8 million for the comparable period for fiscal 2014 from $31.8 million to $41.6 million. This increase was due primarily to an increase in
turnaround amortization and integrity and replacement costs amortization.            Interest Expense, Net              2016 vs. 2015             Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased during fiscal 2016 by $14.4 million for the comparable period for fiscal 2015 from $26.6 million to $12.2 million. This decrease was
primarily due to early redemption of Senior Notes due 2018 and the lower interest rate on the Term Loan outstanding.         
   2015 vs. 2014          
  Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) remained relatively constant during fiscal 2015 to the comparable periods in
fiscal 2014.             Income Tax Expense / (Benefit)    
        Our fiscal 2016 and 2015 effective tax rates remained
relatively constant at 36%.             Liquidity and Capital Resources
            We operate in an environment where our
liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products, availability of credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional   
         31   

Table of Contents  

factors beyond our control. Included in such factors are, among others, the level of customer product demand, weather conditions, governmental regulations, worldwide political conditions and
overall market and economic conditions.           The
following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital sources:         
          Primary sources of liquidity
have been cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under a revolving line of credit, which was amended and restated on October 20, 2015 pursuant to the Credit Agreement discussed below. We believe available
capital resources will be adequate to meet our working capital, debt service, and capital expenditure requirements for existing operations. We continuously evaluate our capital budget; however, management does not foresee any significant increase in
maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 that would impact future liquidity or capital resources. Maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures have averaged approximately $6 million annually over the last
three years for the refining and marketing operations and management currently projects this capital expenditure to be approximately $8 - $10 million for fiscal 2017.   
        On October 20, 2015, URC, United Refining Company of
Pennsylvania, Kiantone, United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (collectively, the  Borrowers ) entered into the Credit Agreement with a group of lenders led by PNC
Bank, National Association, and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on October 19, 2020. Until the Expiration
Date, the Company may borrow on the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.        
  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to
$225,000,000. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their commitments or
additional lenders commit to fund such increase. Interest under the New Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agent s prime rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the
daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula
calculating the Company s average unused availability under the facility. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on the
Closing Date ( Term Loan  and, together with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the  Credit Obligations ). Under the Term Loan, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i)
the greater of the Agent s prime rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.25%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to
3.25%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula calculating the Company s average unused availability under the facility. The Term Loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The
Term Loan shall be paid in full on or prior to the Expiration Date and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule. Prepayment of the Term Loan in whole or in part may be made at any time without
premium or penalty.   
         32

   The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash
accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the security interest in the refinery
and the equity interests in Kiantone shall be released.           The proceeds of the Credit Agreement will be used to (i) refinance the Company s existing senior debt under the Existing Credit Facility (ii) provide for the Company s general corporate needs,
including working capital requirements and capital expenditures, (iii) repay and satisfy in full those certain 10.500% senior secured notes due 2018 (the  Senior Secured Notes due 2018 ) and (iv) pay the fees and expenses associated with
the Credit Agreement.           On October 6, 2015, the
Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding $237,250,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 and the Consent Solicitation. The Tender Offer and
Consent Solicitation was made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated October 6, 2015 and related consent and letter of transmittal. The Tender Offer was set to expire on November 2, 2015. Holders of Senior
Secured Notes due 2018 that validly tendered prior to the consent deadline would receive total consideration of $1,057.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which included a consent
payment of $30.00. Holders that tender after the consent deadline and prior to the Expiration Date would receive total consideration of $1,027.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.   
        On October 20, 2015, the Company announced that $217,871,000
aggregate principal amount, or 91.83% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018, were validly tendered prior to the consent deadline. The Company also received the requisite consents for the proposed amendments to eliminate most of the covenants
applicable to the Senior Secured Notes due 2018, including the release of the collateral securing the Notes. The remaining 8.17% of the Senior Secured Notes due 2018 or $19,379,000, were fully redeemed at a redemption price of 105.25% of par value
plus accrued interest of $452,177 on November 19, 2016.            On December 9, 2015, United Refining Company of New York Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a Loan Agreement with a bank, in the amount of
$50,000,000 which matures on December 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for
Fixed Rate Loans, at the Fixed Rate. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 84 monthly principal installments of approximately $129,000 with the remaining principal balance due on December 9, 2022. The loan is secured by a
first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, guaranteed by United Refining Company and contains various covenants, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio.
           On October 20, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower)
and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a loan agreement with a bank in the amount of $25,000,000 which matures on October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for
LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83
monthly principal installments of approximately $83,000 with the remaining principal balance due on October 20, 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of
Pennsylvania, guaranteed by United Refining Company, and contains various covenants, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Proceeds of the loan are to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.

   Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market
funds. These investments have staggered maturity dates, none of which exceed three months. They have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are traded in public markets. During fiscal 2016, significant uses of cash are summarized in the
table below under  Significant Uses of Cash :

Dividends to preferred stockholder and common stockholder of $48.6 million            

Principal reductions of long-term debt $258.7 million      
        We require a substantial investment in working capital which
is susceptible to large variations during the year resulting from purchases of inventory and seasonal demands. Inventory purchasing activity is a function of sales activity and turnaround cycles for the different refinery units.  
        Future liquidity, both short and long-term, will continue to
be primarily dependent on realizing a refinery margin sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses, including planned capital expenditures. We expect to be able to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, contractual obligations, letter of
credit and debt service requirements out of cash flow from operations, cash on hand and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement. This provides the Company with flexibility relative to its cash flow requirements in light of market
fluctuations, particularly involving crude oil prices and seasonal business cycles and will assist the Company in meeting its working capital, ongoing capital expenditure needs and for general corporate purposes.   
        We had outstanding letters of credit of $8,753,000 as of
August 31, 2016. As of August 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facility resulting in net availability of $216,247,000.

   The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations for the periods
indicated that existed as of August 31, 2016 and is based on information appearing in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8:         

(a)  
  Long-term debt consists of term loans with various banks and equipment finance companies as well as certain capital lease obligations. See Note 8 to  Consolidated
Financial Statements, Item 8  for additional information.     

(b)  
  On October 20, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a loan agreement with a bank in the amount of
$25,000,000 which matures on October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for
Fixed Rate Loans, at the greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83 monthly principal installments of approximately $83,000 with the remaining principal balance due on October 20,
2023. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, guaranteed by United Refining Company, and contains various covenants, which include, among others,
maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Proceeds of the loan are to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.     

(c)  
  Interest rates on the various components of long-term debt range from 3.0% to 5.0%. The table represents anticipated interest on long-term debt in each period at
current interest rates and assuming contractually scheduled principal payments. See Note 8 to  Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 .     

(d)  
  The above does not reflect the Credit Facility, which had a balance of $0 as of August 31, 2016. The applicable margin varies with our facility s average
unused availability calculation. See Note 8 to  Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 .     

(e)  
  Pension obligations are not included since payments are not known.     

(f)  
  Enbridge obligations related to the Put and Call Agreement are not included since payments are not known.     
        Although we are not aware of any pending circumstances which
would change our expectations, changes in the tax laws, the imposition of and changes in federal and state clean air and clean fuel requirements and other changes in environmental laws and regulations may also increase future capital expenditure
levels. Future capital expenditures are also subject to business conditions affecting the industry. We continue to investigate strategic acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing facilities.   
        Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
environment affect nearly all of our operations. As is the case with all the companies engaged in similar industries, we face significant exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. Future expenditures
related to environmental matters cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances due to the uncertainties as to required remediation methods and related clean-up cost estimates. We cannot predict what additional environmental legislation or
regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied.

    Seasonal Factors    
        Seasonal factors affecting the Company s business may
cause variation in the prices and margins of some of the Company s products. For example, demand for gasoline tends to be highest in spring and summer months, while demand for home heating oil and kerosene tends to be highest in winter months.
           As a result, the margin on gasoline prices versus
crude oil costs generally tends to increase in the spring and summer, while margins on home heating oil and kerosene tend to increase in winter.         
   Inflation          
  The effect of inflation on the Company has not been significant during the last five fiscal years.   
         Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
        In May, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. This guidance will now be effective
for our financial statements in the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial
statements.            In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires debt issuance costs related directly to notes payable be deducted from the face amount of that note and the amortization of such costs be classified as interest
expense. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity must retrospectively apply the guidance. We are currently evaluating the effect of
adopting this new accounting guidance and do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements.         
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires deferred income
tax balances to be presented as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Effective August 31, 2016, the Company adopted the accounting and reporting
requirements included in ASU 2015-17 for balance sheet classification of deferred taxes requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. The Company has applied these requirements retrospectively. Accordingly, the
Company has included $5,822,000 of previously reported current deferred income tax liabilities in the $61,743,000 noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities in its August 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of these accounting and
reporting requirements had no impact on the Company s results of operations or cash flows.            In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU
2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurements, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.   
        In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU-2016-02
 Leases,  which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 840. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with
early adoption permitted. The guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or   
         36   

Table of Contents  

operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee
would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its
financial statements and footnote disclosures.            In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 which includes guidance to clarify how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including contingent consideration payments made after a business
acquisition and debt extinguishment costs. Specifically, cash payments to settle a contingent consideration liability which are not made soon after the acquisition date should be classified as cash used in financing activities up to the initial
amount of contingent consideration recognized with the remaining amount classified as cash flows from operating activities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.         

ITEM 7A.   
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      
        We use our Credit Agreement to finance a portion of our
operations. These on-balance sheet financial instruments, to the extent they provide for variable rates, expose us to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the PNC Prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or the LIBOR rate.   
        We have exposure to price fluctuations of crude oil and
refined products. We do not manage the price risk related to all of our inventories of crude oil and refined products with a permanent formal hedging program, but we do manage our risk exposure by managing inventory levels and by selectively
applying hedging activities. At August 31, 2016, the Company had no future positions hedging crude or product inventories.         
  From time to time the Company uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil purchase costs and refining margins.
Derivative products, historically crude oil option contracts (puts) and crackspread option contracts have been used to hedge the volatility of these items. The Company does not enter such contracts for speculative purposes. The Company accounts for
changes in the fair value of its contracts by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in its statement of operations. The Company includes the carrying amounts of the contracts in prepaid expenses and other assets or
accounts payable in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.         
  At August 31, 2016, we were exposed to the risk of market price declines with respect to a substantial portion of our crude oil and
refined product inventories.

  Warren, Pennsylvania         
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Refining Company and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2016 and 2015,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholder s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.         
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.            In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United Refining Company and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2016
and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.   
   Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      
          Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
             The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of United Refining Company and its subsidiaries, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and its subsidiaries and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ). All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.            The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail.
           The wholesale segment is
responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and industrial customers. The retail segment operates a network of Company
operated retail units under the Red Apple Food Mart      and Country Fair      brand names selling petroleum products under the Kwik Fill     , Citgo      and Keystone      brand names, as well as convenience and grocery items.            The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Refining, Inc. ( URI ), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of United Acquisition Corp., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Apple Group, Inc. (the  Parent ).         
    Cash and Cash Equivalents           
  For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investment securities with maturities
of three months or less at date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.              Short-Term Investments              The Company holds a certificate of deposit at a bank with a maturity date of six months.         
    Derivative Instruments           
  From time to time the Company uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil purchase costs and refining margins.
Derivative products, historically crude oil option contracts (puts) and crackspread option contracts have been used to hedge the volatility of these items. The Company does not enter such contracts for speculative purposes. The Company accounts for
changes in the fair value of its contracts by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in its Statement of Operations. The Company includes the carrying amounts of the contracts in derivative liability in its Consolidated
Balance Sheet.           At August 31, 2016, the Company had
no derivative instruments outstanding as part of its risk management strategy.           For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Company recognized $0 of losses in costs and expenses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
          Inventories and Exchanges     
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (LCM),
with cost being determined under the Last-in, First-out (LIFO) method for crude oil and petroleum product inventories and the First-in, First-out (FIFO)   
         45

method for merchandise. Supply inventories are stated at either the LCM or replacement cost and include various parts for the refinery operations. If the cost of inventories exceeds their market
value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.             Property, Plant and Equipment              Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives. Routine current maintenance, repairs and replacement costs are
charged against income. Expenditures which materially increase values, expand capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized. A summary of the principal useful lives used in computing depreciation expense is as follows:   
     
            Leases
             The Company leases land, buildings, and
equipment under long-term operating and capital leases and accounts for the leases in accordance with ASC 360-10-30-8. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The lease term begins
on the date the Company has the right to control the use of the leased property pursuant to the terms of the lease.         
    Deferred Integrity and Replacement Costs     
        The Company and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation, a subsidiary
of the Company, and Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership ( EELP ) and Enbridge Pipelines, Inc. ( EPI  and, together with EELP, the  Carriers ), entered into a letter agreement dated July 31, 2014, as amended, (the
 Letter Agreement ) with respect to a pipeline ( Line 10 ) owned by the Carriers, which transports crude oil from Canada to the Company s Kiantone Pipeline. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to fund
certain integrity costs necessary to maintain Line 10, and agreed to pay for half the cost of replacing certain portions of Line 10.         
  The integrity and replacement costs, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which
is approximately 11 years. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, net deferred integrity and replacement costs amounted to $112,892,000 and $58,634,000, respectively. Amortization expense of $12,286,000, $6,282,000 and $524,000 is included in depreciation
and amortization for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.              Deferred Maintenance Turnarounds              The cost of maintenance turnarounds, which consist of complete shutdown and inspection of significant units of the refinery at intervals of three or more years for necessary repairs and replacements, are
deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which ranges from 3 to 10 years. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, deferred turnaround costs included in Deferred Turnaround Costs and Other Assets, amounted to
$17,280,000 and $28,489,000, which are net of accumulated amortization of $32,981,000 and $20,888,000, respectively. Amortization expense included in depreciation and amortization for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 amounted to
$12,724,000, $14,479,000 and $11,319,000, respectively.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES    
         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)        
     Amortizable Intangible Assets     
        The Company amortizes identifiable intangible assets such as
brand names, non-compete agreements, leasehold covenants and deed restrictions on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 5 to 25 years.  
          Revenue Recognition     
        Revenues for products sold by the wholesale segment are
recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, at which time title to those products is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. At no point do we recognize revenue from the sale of
products prior to the transfer of its title. Title to product is transferred to the customer at the shipping point, under pre-determined contracts for sale at agreed upon or posted prices to customers of which collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenues for products sold by the retail segment are recognized immediately upon sale to the customer. Included in Net Sales and Costs of Goods Sold are consumer excise taxes of $245,843,000, $246,636,000 and $238,332,000 for the years ended August
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.              Cost
Classifications              Our Costs of Goods Sold
(which excludes depreciation and amortization) include Refining Cost of Products Sold and related Refining Operating expenses.         
  Refining Cost of Products Sold includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, the cost of purchased finished products,
transportation costs and distribution costs. Retail Cost of Products Sold include cost for motor fuels and for merchandise. Motor fuel cost of products sold represents net cost for purchased fuel. Merchandise cost of products sold includes
merchandise purchases, net of merchandise rebates and inventory shrinkage. Wholesale cost of products sold includes the cost of fuel and lubricants, transportation and distribution costs and labor.   
          Income Taxes     
        The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.         
  The Company s results of operations are included in the consolidated Federal income tax return of the Parent and separately in
various state jurisdictions. Income taxes are calculated on a separate return basis with consideration of the Tax Sharing Agreement between the Parent and its subsidiaries. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax
examinations by U.S. federal, state or local tax authorities for years before fiscal 2012. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax positions as a component of interest expense, net and
other, net, respectively. No amounts of such expenses are currently accrued.              Post-Retirement Healthcare and Pension Benefits           
  The Company provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to salaried and certain hourly employees that retired prior to September 1,
2010. The benefits provided are hospitalization and medical coverage for the employee and spouse until age 65. Benefits continue until the death of the retiree, which results in the   

         47   

Table of Contents  

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES    
         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)        
   
termination of benefits for all dependent coverage. If an employee leaves the Company as a terminated vested member of a pension plan prior to normal retirement age, the person is not entitled to
any post-retirement healthcare benefits. Benefits payable under this program are secondary to any benefits provided by Medicare or any other governmental programs.   
        In June 2010, the Company announced changes to the healthcare
and pension plans provided to salaried employees. Effective September 1, 2010, postretirement medical benefits for new hires and active salaried employees retiring after September 1, 2010 were eliminated. Additionally, effective
January 1, 2011, deductibles and co-payments were added to the medical benefits plan for all active and retired employees. For salaried employees meeting certain age and service requirements, the Company contributes a defined dollar amount
towards the cost of retiree healthcare based upon the employee s length of service. Similarly, effective August 31, 2010, benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide an enhanced contribution under its defined contribution 401(k) plan as well as a transition contribution for older employees. The changes
made for the salary group described above were also incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement reached with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No.95 effective February 1, 2012.   
        The Company accrues post-retirement benefits other than
pensions, during the years that the employee renders the necessary service, of the expected cost of providing those benefits to an employee and the employee s beneficiaries and covered dependents.   
          Use of Estimates     
        The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
          Allowance for Doubtful Accounts     
        The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based
on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible. The Company also recorded additional allowances based on historical collection experience and its assessment of the general financial conditions affecting the customer base.
Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a weekly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance.
             Concentration Risks     
        Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments.            The Company places its temporary cash investments with quality financial institutions. At times, such investments were in excess of FDIC insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in
such accounts.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES    
         NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued)        
   The Company purchased approximately 15% of its cost of goods sold from one vendor during
each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company is not obligated to purchase from this vendor, and, if necessary, there are other vendors from which the Company can purchase crude oil and other petroleum based
products. The Company had $0 in accounts payable for each of the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 to this vendor.         
    Environmental Matters           
  The Company expenses environmental expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no
current or future benefit is discernible. Expenditures, which extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. The Company determines its liability on a site by site basis and records
a liability at the time when it is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company s estimated liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable
that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of the relevant costs. The estimated liability of the Company is not reduced for possible recoveries from insurance carriers and is recorded in
accrued liabilities.              Goodwill and Other
Non-Amortizable Assets              In accordance
with ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with ASC 350. Other definite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized over
their estimated useful lives.            The Company
performed separate impairment tests for its goodwill and tradename using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value of the Company s reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The fair value of the tradename exceeded its carrying
value. The Company has noted no subsequent indication that would require testing its goodwill and tradename for impairment.         
    Long-Lived Assets           
  Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of these assets (other than goodwill and tradename)
may not be recoverable, the Company will assess the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow forecasts. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value.   
          Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income     
        The Company reports comprehensive (loss) income in
accordance with ASC 220-10. ASC 220-10 establishes guidelines for the reporting and display of comprehensive (loss) income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive (loss) income includes charges and credits to equity that is
not the result of transactions with the shareholder. Included in other comprehensive loss for the Company is a charge for unrecognized post-retirement costs, which is net of taxes in accordance with ASC 715. The accumulated other comprehensive
loss balance is made up entirely of unrecognized post-retirement costs.              Recent Accounting Pronouncements              In May, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company
should recognize   
         49

revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. This guidance will now be effective for our financial statements in the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. We are
currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements.         
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires debt issuance
costs related directly to notes payable be deducted from the face amount of that note and the amortization of such costs be classified as interest expense. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2015, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity must retrospectively apply the guidance. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our
financial statements.            In November 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-17  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires deferred income tax balances to be presented as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. Effective August 31, 2016, the Company adopted the accounting and reporting requirements included in ASU 2015-17 for balance sheet classification of deferred taxes requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to
be classified as noncurrent. The Company has applied these requirements retrospectively. Accordingly, the Company has included $5,822,000 of previously reported current deferred income tax liabilities in the $61,743,000 noncurrent deferred income
tax liabilities in its August 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of these accounting and reporting requirements had no impact on the Company s results of operations or cash flows.   
        In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurements,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently assessing the
impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.         
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU-2016-02  Leases,  which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) 840. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance requires a dual approach for lessee
accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For
finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this
guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.            In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 which includes guidance to clarify how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including
contingent consideration payments made after a business acquisition and debt extinguishment costs. Specifically, cash payments to settle a contingent consideration liability which are not made soon after the acquisition date should be classified as
cash used in financing activities up to the initial amount of contingent consideration recognized with the remaining amount classified as cash flows from operating activities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company

expects to adopt this guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.              Reclassification     
        Certain amounts in the prior year s consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the presentation in the current year.         

2.   
   Accounts Receivable, Net            
  As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $750,000 and $850,000, respectively.

3.   
   Inventories            
  Inventories consist of the following:         
          As of August 31, 2016 and
2015, the replacement cost of LIFO inventories (FIFO) exceeded their LIFO carrying values (LCM) on the balance sheets by approximately $4,718,000 and $6,201,000, respectively, which includes the LCM inventory write-down of $13,052,000 and $0,
respectively, and a LIFO increase (decrease) of $8,334,000 and $(6,201,000), respectively. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge to Costs of Goods Sold from a LIFO layer liquidation of $15,703,000 and $0,
respectively.            Included in petroleum product
inventories are exchange balances either held for or due from other petroleum marketers. These balances are not significant.         
  The Company does not own sources of crude oil and depends on outside vendors for its needs.

   Property, Plant and Equipment            
  Property, plant and equipment is summarized as follows:   
     
          Depreciation and amortization
on the above assets for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $22,643,000 and $20,678,000, respectively.         
  On March 6, 2013, the Company, through its subsidiary United Biofuels, Inc. ( UBI ), acquired a partially completed 50 million
gallon per year biodiesel facility in Brooklyn, New York as part of the acquisition by its parent company, United Refining, Inc., and United Metro Energy Corp. ( UMEC ), a subsidiary of the Company s parent company, of certain assets
of Metro Fuel Oil Corp, and its affiliates. UBI has initiated the project to complete and modify the biodiesel plant.         
  The Company paid $9,800,000 for such biodiesel facility. Due to the Company and UMEC having a common owner, the Company recorded the
acquisition of the biodiesel facility based on an allocation of the carrying value of all assets acquired by its parent and UMEC from Metro Fuel Oil Corp., or $20,735,000. The difference between the carrying value of the biodiesel facility and
the amount paid by the Company has been recorded as a capital contribution net of the tax effect of $4,960,000. Commissioning the modified biodiesel plant is expected during fiscal year 2018. As of August 31, 2016, the remaining cost of
the project is expected to be about $37,000,000.         

5.   
   Goodwill and Intangible Assets            
  As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company s trade name, goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, included in the Company s
retail segment, were as follows:

   Accrued Liabilities            
  Accrued liabilities include the following:         

The Company occupies premises, primarily retail gas stations and convenience stores and office facilities under long-term leases which
require minimum annual rents plus, in certain instances, the payment of additional rents based upon sales. The leases generally are renewable for one to three five-year periods.   
        As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, capitalized lease
obligations, included in long-term debt, amounted to $4,087,000 and $4,212,000, respectively, inclusive of current portion of $143,000 and $124,000, respectively. The related assets (retail gas stations and convenience stores) as of August 31,
2016 and 2015 amounted to $3,492,000 and $3,732,000, net of accumulated amortization of $1,197,000 and $956,000, respectively. Lease amortization amounting to $241,000, $207,000 and $185,000 for the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively is included in depreciation and amortization expense.            Future minimum lease payments as of August 31, 2016 are summarized as follows:

   Long-Term Debt            
   Amended, Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement    
        On October 20, 2015, URC, United Refining Company of
Pennsylvania, Kiantone Pipeline Corporation ( Kiantone ), United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (collectively, the  Borrowers ) entered into an Amended,
Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the  Agent ), and PNC Capital Markets LLC,
as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated May 18, 2011 and last amended June 18, 2013, by and between the Company and certain subsidiaries and PNC Bank, National
Association, as Administrative Agent (the  Existing Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement will terminate on October 19, 2020 (the  Expiration Date ). Until the Expiration Date, the Company may borrow on the New
Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.        
  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to
$225,000,000. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their commitments or
additional lenders commit to fund such increase. Interest under the New Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agent s prime rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the
daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula
calculating the Company s average unused availability under the facility. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no base rate or euro-rate borrowings outstanding under the facility. Letters of credit totaling $8,753,000 were
outstanding at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.            In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on the Closing Date ( Term Loan  and,
together with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the  Credit Obligations ). Under the Term Loan, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agent s prime
rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.25%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margin will
vary depending on a formula calculating the Company s average unused availability under the facility. The Term Loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Term Loan shall be paid in full on
or prior to the Expiration Date and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule.         
  The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the
refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the security interest in the refinery and the equity interest in Kiantone shall be
released.           The Credit Agreement requires minimum
undrawn availability of $15,000,000 at all times prior to the repayment of the Term Loan and the greater of 12.5% of the maximum New Revolving Credit Facility or $25,000,000 after the repayment of the Term Loan. The Company is also required to
maintain a consolidated net

worth of no less than $100,000,000. The Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including in connection with non-ordinary course asset sales, equity issuances
and the incurrence of additional debt. Unless assets sold in non-ordinary course transactions were included in the borrowing base for the New Revolving Credit Facility, mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to the repayment of the Term Loan
and then the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, covenants related to the fixed charge coverage ratio, payment of fees, conduct of business,
maintenance of existence and assets, payment of indebtedness and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, intercompany obligations, affiliate transactions, amendments to organizational documents, and financial statements.   
        The proceeds of the Credit Agreement were used to (i) repay
and satisfy in full those certain 10.500% senior secured notes due 2018 (the  Senior Secured Notes due 2018 ), (ii) provide for the Company s general corporate needs, including working capital requirements and capital expenditures and
(iii) pay the fees and expenses associated with the Credit Agreement.            In connection with the redemption of all its Senior Secured Notes due 2018, the Company recorded a loss of $19,316,000 on the early extinguishment of debt consisting of a redemption premium of $7,009,000,
a consent payment of $6,536,000, a write-off of unamortized net debt discount of $3,600,000 and a write-off of deferred finance costs of $2,171,000.         
   Other Long Term Debt          
  On December 9, 2015, United Refining Company of New York Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner),
entered into a Loan Agreement with a bank, in the amount of $50,000,000 which matures on December 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate,
(b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the Fixed Rate. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 84 monthly principal installments of approximately $129,000 with the remaining principal balance
due on December 9, 2022. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and contains various covenants applicable to the Borrower, which include, among others,
maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan are to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.

   Employee Benefit Plans            
  The Company sponsors three defined benefit plans and seven defined contribution plans covering substantially all its full-time employees.
The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on each employee s years of service and compensation. Effective February 1, 2012 benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan for hourly employees were frozen.
Additionally, effective August 31, 2010 benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide
enhanced contributions under its defined contribution 401(k) plan as well as a transition contribution for older employees. The Company s policy is to contribute the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA), as amended and any additional amounts for strategic financial purposes or to meet other goals relating to plan funded status. The assets of the plans are invested in an investment trust fund and consist of interest-bearing cash,
separately managed accounts and bank common/collective trust funds.            In addition to the above, the Company provides certain post-retirement healthcare benefits to salaried and certain hourly employees that retired prior to September 1, 2010. These post-retirement
benefit plans are unfunded and the costs are paid by the Company from general assets.

also includes the effect of assumed future compensation increases for plans in which benefits for prior service are affected by compensation changes. Each of the three pension plans, whose
information is aggregated above, have asset values less than these measures. Plan funding amounts are calculated pursuant to ERISA and Internal Revenue Code rules. The postretirement benefits are not funded.   
         Weighted average assumptions used to determine year end
benefit obligations:          
          The discount rate assumptions
at August 31, 2016 and 2015 were determined independently for each plan. A yield curve was produced for a universe containing the majority of U.S.-issued Aa-graded corporate bonds, all of which were non-callable (or callable with make-whole
provisions). For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.   
         Weighted average assumptions used to determine net
periodic costs:          
          For measurement purposes, the
assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical and dental benefits was 7.00% and 7.00% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5% for medical benefits until 2025 and remain at that
level thereafter. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate, a 1 percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following effects:   
     
          The expected return on plan
assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plans and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes.

   The investment policy for the plans is formulated by the Company s Pension Plan
Committee (the  Committee ). The Committee is responsible for adopting and maintaining the investment policy, managing the investment of plan assets and ensuring that the plans  investment program is in compliance with all
provisions of ERISA, as well as the appointment of any investment manager who is responsible for implementing the plans  investment process.         
  In drafting a strategic asset allocation policy, the primary objective is to invest assets in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of
the plans to the Company s employees, their spouses and other beneficiaries, when the obligations come due. The stability and improvement of the plans  funded status is based on the various reasons for which money is funded. Other factors
that are considered include the characteristics of the plans  liabilities and risk-taking preferences.         
  The asset classes used by the plan are the United States equity market, the international equity market, the United States fixed income or
bond market and cash or cash equivalents. Plan assets are diversified to minimize the risk of large losses. Cash flow requirements are coordinated with the custodian trustees and the investment manager to minimize market timing effects. The asset
allocation guidelines call for a maximum and minimum range for each broad asset class as noted above.         
  The target strategic asset allocation and ranges established under the asset allocation represents a long-term perspective. The Committee
will rebalance assets to ensure that divergences outside of the permissible allocation ranges are minimal and brief as possible.         
  The net of investment manager fee asset return objective is to achieve a return earned by passively managed market index funds, weighted
in the proportions identified in the strategic asset allocation matrix. Each investment manager is expected to perform in the top one-third of funds having similar objectives over a full market cycle.   
        The investment policy is reviewed by the Committee at least
annually and confirmed or amended as needed.         
  Under ASC 715-30-25, the transition obligation, prior service costs, and actuarial (gains)/losses are recognized in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income/Loss each August 31 or any interim measurement date, while amortization of these amounts through net periodic benefit cost will occur in accordance with ASC 715-30 and ASC 715-60. The estimated amounts that will be
amortized in 2017 are as follow:

   The following contributions and benefit payments, which reflect expected future service,
as appropriate, are expected to be paid:         
          The pension plan
contributions are deposited into a trust, and the pension plan benefit payments are made from trust assets. For the postretirement benefit plan, the contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which
are paid from general assets.            The Company s
postretirement benefit plan is affected by The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the  Act ). Beginning in 2006, the Act provides a Federal subsidy payment to companies providing benefit plans that
meet certain criteria regarding their generosity. The Company expects to receive those subsidy payments. The Company has accounted for the Act in accordance with ASC 715-60-05-8, which requires, in the Company s case, recognition on August 31,
2004. The benefit obligation as of that date reflects the effect of the federal subsidy, and this amount is identified in the table reconciling the change in benefit obligation above. The estimated effect of the subsidy on cash flow is shown in
the accompanying table of expected benefit payments above. The expected subsidy reduced net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $5,168,000, as compared with the amount calculated without considering the effects of the subsidy.   
        The Company also contributes to voluntary employee savings
plans through regular monthly contributions equal to various percentages of the amounts invested by the participants. The Company s contributions to these plans amounted to $2,796,000, $2,767,000 and $2,752,000 for the years ended August

   Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments            
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is
practicable to estimate that value.            The carrying
amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, the revolving credit facility and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair
value using significant other observable inputs (Level 2).            The fair value of long-term debt (See Note 8 to  Consolidated Financial Statements ) was determined using the fair market value of the individual debt instruments. As of August 31, 2016, the
carrying amount and estimated fair value of these debt instruments approximated $287,677,000 and $287,457,000, respectively.

The Series A Preferred Stock rank: (i) senior to the Company s common stock; (ii) senior to all other classes of equity securities other than
preferred stock which by their terms do not rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock; and (iii) on parity with any other series of the Company s preferred stock that does not provide it ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock;

The Series A Preferred Stock shall receive dividends at a rate of 6.00% of the Stated Value (which is $10,000) per share per annum;

The Series A Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights unless otherwise required by law, except in limited circumstances relating to amendments to
URC s certificate of incorporation or amendments to the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock;            

In the event dividends have not been paid in the aggregate amount payable for six or more Dividends Periods, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to elect two directors to the Board of Directors, who shall remain directors until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid in full or set aside for payment. Upon the payment or set aside
of such dividends, the term of office of the directors appointed by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall terminate and the size of the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two; and

   Transactions with Affiliated Companies            
  On December 21, 2001, the Company acquired the operations and working capital assets of Country Fair. The fixed assets of Country Fair
were acquired by related entities controlled by John A. Catsimatidis, the indirect sole shareholder of the Company. These assets are being leased to the Company at an annual aggregate rental fee which management, based on an independent third party
valuation, believes is fair, over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $5,365,000, $5,360,000 and $5,360,000 of rent payments were made to these related entities. The Company is not a
guarantor on the underlying mortgages on the properties.            Concurrent with the above acquisition of Country Fair, the Company entered into a management agreement with a non-subsidiary affiliate to operate and manage 10 of the retail units owned by the
non-subsidiary affiliate on a turn-key basis. For the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company billed the affiliate $1,324,000, $1,301,000 and $1,207,000 for management fees and overhead expenses incurred in the management and
operation of the retail units which amount was deducted from expenses. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a (receivable) payable to the affiliate of $(4,000) and $296,000, respectively, under the terms of the agreement, which is

had previously leased from a non-subsidiary affiliate. The Company has entered into a management agreement with the non-subsidiary affiliate to operate and manage the retail units owned by the non-subsidiary affiliate on a turnkey basis. For the
years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company billed the affiliate $2,123,000, $2,325,000 and $2,165,000, respectively, for management fees and overhead expenses incurred in the management and operation of 51 retail units, which amount was
deducted from expenses. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net sales to the affiliate amounted to $92,892,000, $131,326,000 and $191,828,000, respectively. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a payable to the
affiliate of $598,000 and $1,106,000, respectively, under the terms of the agreement, which is included in Amounts Due To/From Affiliated Companies, net.         
  The Company paid a service fee relating to certain costs incurred by its Parent for the Company s New York office. During the years
ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, such fees amounted to approximately $2,400,000, $2,000,000, and $2,000,000, respectively, which is included in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. At August 31, 2016, the Company had a payable to the
Parent concerning these fees of $100,000.            The
Company joins with the Parent and the Parent s other subsidiaries in filing a Federal income tax return on a consolidated basis. Income taxes are calculated on a separate return basis with consideration of the Tax Sharing Agreement between the
Parent and its subsidiaries. Amounts related to the Tax Sharing Agreement for the utilization by the Company of certain tax attributes of the Parent and other subsidiaries related to the tax years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 amounted to
$470,000, $36,000 and $(3,034,000), respectively and

building owned by John A. Catsimatidis.            On
July 26, 2013, the Company issued and sold to URI, its sole stockholder and parent, 14,116.375 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $141,163,750 in accordance with the terms and provisions of a Subscription
Agreement by and between the Company and URI. The Subscription Agreement contained customary representations and warranties concerning the acquisition of the Series A Preferred Stock by URI and restrictions on the transfer of the Series A Preferred
Stock. See Note 12, Stockholders  Equity, for a description of the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock.         
  During the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Company made $1,456,000, $1,270,000 and $1,158,000, respectively, of rent
payments to related entities for the lease of convenience stores and other buildings owned by affiliates.         
  During the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company paid $4,662,000, $4,774,000 and $4,399,000, respectively, to a related
captive insurance company ( Captive ). The Captive was established in fiscal 2014 and will provide the Company with a primary layer of worker s compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance. The insurance is
supplemented by additional excess insurance policies secured directly from third party insurers.            During the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company made payments to an insurance company for two of its affiliates totaling $254,000 and $283,000, respectively.

the affiliate during the year ended August 31, 2016.            The Company receives engineering services from a subsidiary of our Parent company to assist with the construction of its biodiesel facility in Brooklyn, New York. During the fiscal years ended August 31,
2016 and 2015 the Company paid $589,000 and $349,000 to this entity for such services. At August 31, 2016, the Company had a payable to the Parent subsidiary of $35,000.

   Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies            
  The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to pollution and protection of the environment such as
those governing releases of certain materials into the environment and the storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and clean-up of wastes, including, but not limited to, the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, the Clean Air Act, as amended,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and analogous state and local laws and regulations.   
        Due to the nature of the Company s business, the Company
is and will continue to be subject to various environmental claims, legal actions and actions by regulatory authorities. In the opinion of management, all current matters are without merit or are of such kind or involve such amounts that an
unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or operations of the Company.         
  The management of the Company believes that remediation and related environmental response costs incurred during the normal course of
business, including contractual obligations as well as activities required under applicable law and regulation, will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or operations.

   In addition to the foregoing proceedings, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties
to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their respective business operations. In the opinion of management, all such matters are adequately covered by insurance, or if not so covered, are without merit or are of such kind,
or involve such amounts that unfavorable dispositions would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.   
        The Company also closely monitors all climate change and
Greenhouse Gas ( GHG ) legislation, better known as Cap and Trade as well as fuels mandates requiring the increased use of renewable resources in motor fuel. The Company believes, however, that implementation of reasonable, incremental
changes over time will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or operations. The ultimate cost of GHG reduction mandates and their effect on our business are, however, unknown until implementing
regulations are available. Similarly, the costs of compliance with renewable fuels mandates in the future remains unknown until a final regulatory structure has been adopted.

   Segments of Business            
  The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations
are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail.            The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and
industrial customers. The retail segment operates a network of Company operated retail units under the Red Apple Food
Mart      and Country Fair      brand names selling petroleum products under the Kwik Fill     , Citgo      and Keystone      brand names, as well as convenience and grocery items.            The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Footnote 1 to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment revenues are calculated using market prices and are eliminated upon consolidation. Summarized financial information regarding the Company s reportable segments is presented in the following table.

   Put and Call Option Agreement            
  On April 8, 2015 (the  Execution Date ), the Company entered into a Put and Call Option Agreement with each of Enbridge Energy
Limited Partnership ( Enbridge LP ) and Enbridge Pipelines Inc. ( Enbridge Inc.  and, together with Enbridge LP, the  Carriers ). The Put and Call Option Agreement entered into with Enbridge LP (the  U.S.
Agreement ) is substantially similar to the Put and Call Option Agreement entered into with Enbridge Inc. (the  Canadian Agreement  and, together with the U.S. Agreement, the  Put and Call Agreement ). The Put and Call
Agreement was contemplated in that certain Letter Agreement, originally executed on July 31, 2014 and

last amended on April 8, 2015 (the  Letter Agreement ), between the Company and the Carriers relating to approximately 88.85 miles of pipeline owned by the Carriers, which transports
crude oil from Canada to the Company s Kiantone Pipeline in West Seneca, New York, and serves the Company s refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania ( Line 10 ). The Letter Agreement related to the parties  agreement concerning
funding certain integrity and replacement costs for Line 10.            The Carriers own the pipeline facilities generally identified as Line 10, including real property interests through and under which Line 10 passes, the Carriers  assignable permits related to the
ownership and operation of Line 10, as well as personal property, contract rights, records and incidental rights held solely in connection with Line 10 (collectively, the  Assets ).           Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to fund certain integrity costs necessary to maintain Line
10 (the  Integrity Costs ). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Carriers agreed to reconcile their actual expenses for the integrity maintenance and refund any excess payments made by the Company. The parties agreed to apply any
credit to the Company as a result of such reconciliation to amounts owed by the Company for Subsequent Year Pipe Replacement Costs (as defined below). For each subsequent calendar year through the earlier of the expiration or closing of the
purchase rights granted to the Company pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement, the Carriers will provide the Company with an invoice for the Integrity Costs for such calendar year ( Subsequent Year Integrity Costs ). The Carriers 
actual expenses with respect to the integrity maintenance and pipe replacement will be reconciled against the Subsequent Year Integrity and Pipe Replacement Costs.   
        In addition, the Company agreed to pay
for half the cost of replacing certain portions of Line 10 in accordance with a plan agreed to between the Company Parties and the Carriers. The Company will pay 50% of the estimated expenses of the replacement project for each segment of Line 10 to
be replaced (the  Replacement Costs ) within 30 days of its receipt of an invoice for the same, along with a project management fee of 2          1   /   4   %. Each Carrier will initially fund the remaining 50% of the Replacement Costs during
construction, provided that the Company will reimburse the Carriers for their actual cost of funds during the construction process. Once construction is complete and each replaced segment of Line 10 is put into service, and assuming the Company has
not exercised its rights to purchase Line 10 pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement, the Company will repay the Carriers the 50% of the Replacement Costs they funded over a 10-year period.    
        Pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement, the Carriers granted
the Company a right (the  Call Option ) to purchase all of the Assets and the Company granted the Carriers the right to put all the Assets to the Company (the  Put Option  and, together with the Call Option, the  Purchase
Options ) subject to the terms and conditions of the Put and Call Agreement.        
  The Carrier s Put Option is exercisable beginning on the date that is the earlier of (a) January 1, 2026 and (b)
the date that is 30 days after the latest of (i) the date on which the Carriers give notice that the Line 10 replacement work performed pursuant to the Letter Agreement is sufficiently completed (as contemplated in the Call and Put Agreement) and
(ii) the ninth (9   th   ) anniversary of the Execution Date
(the  Put Option Commencement Date ). The Put Option terminates on the date that is 24 months after either (a) the Put Option Commencement Date if such date is the first of a month or (b) the first day of the calendar month
immediately following the Put Option Commencement Date if it is not the first day of the month (the  Put/Call Option Expiry Date ). The Company s Call Option is exercisable at any time beginning on the Execution Date and ending
on the Put/Call Option Expiry Date.            The purchase
price of the Assets (the  Purchase Price ) shall be calculated as follows: the sum of (a) 70% of the book value of the Assets as of July 31, 2014 minus annual depreciation, (b) 100% of total replacement costs for any segment replacements
on the Pipeline commenced by the Carrier, whether completed or ongoing on the   
         69

date of Asset sale is consummated (the  Closing Date ), minus any of such expenses paid by the Company and (c) 100% of the total regulatory requirements costs for any regulatory work
commenced by the Carrier, whether completed or ongoing at the Closing Date, minus any of such expenses paid by the Company. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement with respect to certain work ongoing
at the Closing Date.           Among other customary
conditions to closing, Carrier s obligation to close the sale of the Assets is conditioned on the Company s payment of all obligations outstanding pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement and the Letter Agreement. In addition, the sale of
Assets pursuant to the U.S. Agreement shall close concurrently with the sale of the Assets pursuant to the Canadian Agreement.         
  The Company and the Carrier agreed that certain work must be undertaken in order to carve out portions of Line 10 in Canada from the
Enbridge mainline system and allow it to operate independently. In the event any work is required to similarly separate the U.S. portion of Line 10 from the Enbridge mainline system (the  Carve-Out Work ), a plan to perform such Carve-Out
Work that would result in expenses greater than $38.5 million will require the approval of the Company.         
  In the event any of the maintenance, regulatory requirement, or replacement work contemplated in the Letter Agreement or the Put and Call
Agreement (collectively, the  Work ) is outstanding at the Closing Date, concurrently with the closing of the Asset sale, the Company and the Carriers will enter into an operating agreement (the  Operating Agreement ) pursuant to
which the Carriers will provide certain operational and administrative services (the  Services ) while the Work is ongoing and complete such Work. As payment for the Services and completion of the Work, the Carriers shall be: (i)
reimbursed for all expenses of providing the Services, (ii) paid a fixed fee on an annual basis, which shall be subject to a 2% increase for each successive year following the first year of the Operating Agreement, and (iii) paid for all expenses of
the Work not previously paid, as well as a 2.25% construction management fee.            The Put and Call Agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of the Company and the Carriers and shall automatically terminate if neither Purchase Option is exercised prior to the Put/Call Option
Expiry Date. Moreover, either the Company or a Carrier may terminate the Put and Call Agreement if a closing of the Asset sale shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2028 assuming the terminating party is not then in breach of the Put and
Call Agreement and if a party has breached a representation, such breach has not been cured within the time periods allotted by the Put and Call Agreement. Finally, the Company may terminate the Put and Call Agreement by notifying the Carriers to
cease the replacement work contemplated in the Letter Agreement.            The Company considered whether the Put and Call Agreement should be separated from the host contract in accordance with ASC 815 embedded derivative guidance and concluded that it doesn t meet the
criteria for separation. The Company determined that the Put and Call Agreement is interdependent with the Line l0 Agreement, and therefore is not freestanding and is accounted for as part of the Line 10 Agreement. As such we concluded that there is
no separate accounting impact of the Put and Call Agreement until it becomes probable that it will be exercised. As of August 31, 2016 the Company or the Carrier have not exercised their rights under the Put and Call Agreement.   

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their
respective business operations. These proceedings include various administrative actions relating to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as well as civil matters before various courts seeking money damages. The Company
believes that if the legal proceedings in which it is currently

involved were determined against the Company, there would be no material adverse effect on the Company s operations or its consolidated financial condition. In the opinion of management, all
such matters are adequately covered by insurance, or if not so covered, are without merit or are of such kind, or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated operations or
financial position of the Company.         
       
  On October 20, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a loan
agreement with a bank in the amount of $25,000,000 which matures on October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference
Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83 monthly principal installments of approximately $83,000 with the remaining
principal balance due on October 20, 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, and contains various covenants applicable to the Borrower, which
include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan are to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company.
           The Company has reached an early settlement
agreement with its refinery employees represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 95. The contract is effective February 1, 2017 and expires February 1, 2022.

ITEM 9A.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.            
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures          
  Based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a  15(e) and 15d   15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of August 31, 2014, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively) have
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.         
   Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls          
  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that
reasonable assurance level.             Management s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting          
  The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedure that pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial
statements in accordance with GAAP; that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of the Company s board of directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.        
  Management evaluates the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 and concluded that it is effective.   
        An internal control system over financial reporting has
inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk.

    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
        There have not been any changes in the Company s

         Board Independence    
        Although the Company s securities are not listed on any
national securities exchange and we are therefore not required to have a majority of independent directors, we apply the NYSE MKT standard for independent directors to determine which, if any, of our directors are independent pursuant to such
definition. The NYSE MKT defines an independent director generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company s board of
directors would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.         
  The Company has determined that Messrs. Feinstein, Lall, Lemmonds, Maloney and Mehiel are independent directors as defined under the NYSE
MKT Rule 803.             Audit Committee    
        The Company does not have a class of securities listed on a
national securities exchange or national securities association subject to the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Consequently, the Company does not have an audit committee at this time, and has not
designated an audit committee financial expert. However, the Company is reviewing whether it would be appropriate to appoint an audit committee consisting of independent members of its board of directors.

    Nominating Committee    
        The Company does not have a nominating committee at this
time and believe this is appropriate for our Company as we have one indirect stockholder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John A. Catsimatidis. The Board of Directors, as a whole, participates in the consideration of director nominees. The
Board of Directors does not have a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders and the Board believes this is appropriate as the Company has one indirect stockholder. There are no specific
minimum qualifications that the Board believes must be met by a board nominee.             Code Of Ethics             The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which is filed as Exhibit 14.1 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2003. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available for review on the Company s website at www.urc.com. In the event we determine to amend or waive certain provisions of this code of ethics, we will disclose such amendments or
waivers on our website at  http://www.urc.com  under the heading  Code of Ethics . Any person may request, and the Company will provide without charge, a copy of such code of ethics by writing to John R. Wagner, General
Counsel, 15 Bradley Street, Warren, Pennsylvania 16365.

  The present value of accumulated benefits increased during fiscal 2016 due to the decrease in the discount rate.     
        The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified, non-contributory defined
benefit plan established to provide pension benefits to employees of the Company, including the named executive officers, meeting Pension Plan eligibility criteria. The criteria states that employees are eligible to participate in, and will be
enrolled in, the Pension Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the later of the completion of one Year of Service and attainment of age twenty-one years. Years of service for benefits purposes are measured based on the
number of years in which at least 1,000 hours are worked.            A participant s normal retirement date is the first of the month coinciding with or following the attainment of age 65. Participants who are actively employed may also elect an unreduced option
at age 59    1   /   2   . In addition to a single life annuity, benefits can be paid as other actuarially equivalent annuities.          
  The United Refining Company s Pension Plan for Salaried Employees was frozen effective August 31, 2010 and participants will no
longer accrue a benefit under the Plan. The Plan has been replaced by a new 3% 401(k) contribution.            The benefit formula is based on the average earnings of the participant for the three years in which such participant s earnings were the highest. Earnings include salary and bonus up to a maximum of
the IRC 401(a)(17) limit, which in the year benefits were frozen was $245,000. Benefits are calculated by multiplying the sum of (a) 1.1% of average earnings up to the Social Security compensation base, plus (b) 1.25% of average earnings in
excess of the Social Security compensation base, by (c) the number of years of service. Payments of retirement benefits are not reduced by any Social Security benefits received by the participant. Effective May 2001, for purposes of calculating
retirement benefits, the Company has fixed the earnings subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act at $76,200.00 for years after 2001 for purposes of calculating Social Security compensation base.   
        In connection with a transaction in 1984, a portion of the
benefits from the plan are provided through an annuity contract with an insurance company. The benefits shown in the table are gross amounts before offsetting the insured benefit and thereby represent the total benefit earned with the Company.
           Vested benefits are those amounts to which
participants are entitled regardless of future services to the Company. A participant is credited with a year of service for vesting purposes for each Pension Plan year during which at least 1,000 hours of service are completed, commencing with year
of hire. Each executive is currently vested in his accumulated benefit.            In addition to vested benefits, the Pension Plan provides certain death benefits. Upon death of a participant, the beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the vested interest of the
participant s accrued benefit in the form of a monthly annuity amount, subject to eligibility requirements stipulated in the Pension Plan.         
  The present value of accumulated benefits in the table above has been determined by an independent actuary. These assumptions for August
31, 2016 include a 3.90% discount rate and the RP 2000 mortality table projected to 2017 with a 15-year phase-in and no collar adjustment, each of which is consistent with the   
         78   

Table of Contents  

assumptions used for FYE 2011 financial reporting. Further, it was assumed that benefits will commence at the earliest age in which an unreduced benefit is available (age 59.5 or current age if
later) and there will be no turnover or death prior to retirement.               
   DIRECTOR COMPENSATION          
  The Company pays its non-officer Directors an annual retainer of $15,000 per year and $1,000 for meetings attended. Directors are
reimbursed for reasonable travel, meals, lodging and other expenses incidental to attendance at meetings.                   2016 Director Compensation

ITEM 13.   
   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.      
        On December 21, 2001, the Company acquired the operations
and working capital assets of Country Fair. The fixed assets of Country Fair were acquired by related entities controlled by John A. Catsimatidis, the indirect sole shareholder of the Company. These assets are being leased to the Company at an
annual aggregate rental fee which management, based on an independent third party valuation, believes is fair, over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $5,365,000, $5,360,000 and
$5,360,000 of rent payments were made to these related entities. The Company is not a guarantor on the underlying mortgages on the properties.         
  Concurrent with the above acquisition of Country Fair, the Company entered into a management agreement with a non-subsidiary affiliate to
operate and manage 10 of the retail units owned by the non-subsidiary affiliate on a turn-key basis. For the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company billed the affiliate $1,324,000, $1,301,000 and $1,207,000 for management fees and
overhead expenses incurred in the management and operation of the retail units which amount was deducted from expenses. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a (receivable) payable to the affiliate of $(4,000) and $296,000, respectively,

terminated the leases on 8 additional retail locations which it had previously leased from a non-subsidiary affiliate. The Company has entered into a management agreement with the non-subsidiary affiliate to operate and manage the retail units owned
by the non-subsidiary affiliate on a turnkey basis. For the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company billed the affiliate $2,123,000, $2,325,000 and $2,165,000, respectively, for management fees and overhead expenses incurred in the
management and operation of 51 retail units, which amount was deducted from expenses. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net sales to the affiliate amounted to $92,892,000, $131,326,000 and $191,828,000, respectively. As of
August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a payable to the affiliate of $598,000 and $1,106,000, respectively, under the terms of the agreement, which is included in Amounts Due To/From Affiliated Companies, net.   
        The Company paid a service fee relating to certain costs
incurred by its Parent for the Company s New York office. During the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, such fees amounted to approximately $2,400,000, $2,000,000, and $2,000,000, respectively, which is included in Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses. At August 31, 2016, the Company had a payable to the Parent concerning these fees of $100,000.         
  The Company joins with the Parent and the Parent s other subsidiaries in filing a Federal income tax return on a consolidated basis.
Income taxes are calculated on a separate return basis with consideration of the Tax Sharing Agreement between the Parent and its subsidiaries. Amounts related to the Tax Sharing Agreement for the utilization by the Company of certain tax attributes
of the Parent and other subsidiaries related to the tax years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 amounted to $470,000, $36,000 and $(3,034,000), respectively and have been recorded as a capital contribution (distribution). As of August 31,
2016 and 2015, the Company had a receivable from the Parent of $0 and $2,500,000, respectively, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement.         
  During the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred $401,000, $420,000 and $420,000, respectively, as its share of
occupancy expenses for its offices in New York that it shares with affiliates of the Company. Such offices are located in a building owned by John A. Catsimatidis.
