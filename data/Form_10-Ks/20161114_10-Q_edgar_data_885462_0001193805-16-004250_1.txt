In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 presented reflects all adjustments, which are only normal and recurring, necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company s  2015 Form 10-K. Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. The Company also exercises judgments in the preparation of these condensed financial statements in certain areas including classification of leases and related party transactions.    

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gulf Resources, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Upper Class Group Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which owns 100% of Hong Kong Jiaxing Industrial Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong ( HKJI ). HKJI owns 100% of Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited ("SCHC") which owns 100% of Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry Co., Limited ( SYCI ), Shouguang City Rongyuan Chemical Co, Ltd ( SCRC ) and Daying County Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited ( DCHC ).  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 

On September 2, 2016 the Company announced the planned merger of SYCI and SCRC. As of September 30, 2016, this merger has not yet been finalized. This merger has no material impact on the Company s financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

(b)           Nature of the Business

DCHC was established to further explore and develop natural gas and brine resources (including bromine and crude salt) in PRC. The DCHC business is not fully operational yet. 

(c)           Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, allowances for doubtful accounts were nil. No allowances for doubtful accounts were charged to the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The Company placed $141,083,587 and $133,606,392 with these institutions as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts in the PRC.

(e)           Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Expenditures for new facilities or equipment, and major expenditures for betterment of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives. All other ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

Mineral rights are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Mineral rights are amortized ratably over the term of the lease, or the equivalent term under the units of production method, whichever is shorter. 

Construction in process primarily represents direct costs of construction of plant, machinery and equipment. Costs incurred are capitalized and transferred to property and equipment upon completion, at which time depreciation commences. 

The Company s depreciation and amortization policies on property, plant and equipment, other than mineral rights and construction in process, are as follows: 

Useful life 

(in years)  

Buildings (including salt pans) 

8 - 20 

Plant and machinery (including protective shells, transmission channels and ducts) 

3 - 8 

Motor vehicles 

5 

Furniture, fixtures and equipment 

3-8 

Property, plant and equipment under the capital lease are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, the term of the lease, which is 20 years. 

(f)           Retirement Benefits 

Pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC, the Company participates in a defined contribution retirement plan for its employees arranged by a governmental organization. The Company makes contributions to the retirement plan at the applicable rate based on the employees  salaries. The required contributions under the retirement plans are charged to the condensed consolidated statement of income on an accrual basis when they are due.

(h)           Recoverability of Long-lived Assets 

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360-10-35   Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets  , long-lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. The Company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. 

The Company determines the existence of such impairment by measuring the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) and comparing such amount to the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss, if one exists, is then measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the discounted estimated future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of such assets less costs to sell. Asset impairment charges are recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived asset that will be sold or disposed of to their estimated fair values. Charges for the asset impairment reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to their estimated salvage value in connection with the decision to dispose of such assets. 

For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, certain property, plant and machinery, with net book values of $90,395 were replaced during the enhancement project to protective shells for transmission channels, write-offs of the same amounts, were made and included in write-off/impairment on property, plant and equipment. 

For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, certain property, plant and machinery, with net book values of $819,701 were replaced during the fourth phase enhancement project to protective shells for transmission channels and the enhancement work to bromine production facilities in Factory No.11, write-offs of the same amounts, were made and included in write-off/impairment on property, plant and equipment. 

(i)           Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share of Common Stock 

Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods presented.  Diluted earnings per share are computed using weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive outstanding stock options had been exercised. Potentially dilutive outstanding stock options that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be anti-dilutive, i.e. the exercise prices of the outstanding stock options are greater than the market price of the common stock. The number of anti-dilutive outstanding stock options which were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings was 75,000 and 137,500 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, and 136,875 and 125,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. These awards could be dilutive in the future if the market price of the common stock increases and is greater than the exercise price of these awards.

(i)           Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share of Common Stock   Continued 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

(j)           Reporting Currency and Translation 

The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency, Renminbi ( RMB ), as the functional currency; whereas the functional currency and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar ( USD  or  $ ). 

As such, the Company uses the  current rate method  to translate its PRC operations from RMB into USD, as required under FASB ASC 830  Foreign Currency Matters . The assets and liabilities of its PRC operations are translated into USD using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. The capital accounts are translated at the historical rate. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the balance sheets of the Company s PRC subsidiaries are recorded in stockholders  equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The statement of income and comprehensive income is translated at average rates during the reporting period. Gains or losses resulting from transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies are recognized in net income for the reporting periods as part of general and administrative expense. The statement of cash flows is translated at average rates during the reporting period, with the exception of issuance of shares and payment of dividends which are translated at historical rates. 

(k)          Foreign Operations 

All of the Company s operations and assets are located in PRC.  The Company may be adversely affected by possible political or economic events in this country.  The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted. 

(l)           Exploration Costs 

Exploration costs, which included the cost of researching for appropriate places to drill wells and the cost of well drilling in search of potential natural brine or other resources, are charged to the income statement as incurred. Once the commercial viability of a project has been confirmed, all subsequent costs are capitalized. 

(m)      Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed in business acquisitions. Management of the Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or when a possible impairment is indicated. The Company performs its impairment assessment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. Goodwill impairment is assessed using the expected present value of associated future cash flows. 

(n)           New Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The amendments in this Update require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments in this Update which has no material impact on the financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments in this Update which has no material impact on the financial statements. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Overview 

Gulf Resources conducts operations through its four wholly-owned China-based subsidiaries, SCHC, SYCI, SCRC and DCHC. Our business is also reported in three segments, Bromine and Crude Salt, Chemical Products, and Natural Gas. 

Through SCHC, we produce and sell bromine and crude salt. We are one of the largest producers of bromine in China, as measured by production output. Elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of brominated compounds used in industry and agriculture. Bromine is commonly used in brominated flame retardants, fumigants, water purification compounds, dyes, medicines, and disinfectants. 

Through SYCI, we manufacture and sell chemical products that are used in oil and gas field exploration, oil and gas distribution, oil field drilling, wastewater processing, papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals. 

Through SCRC, we manufacture and sell chemical products that are used for human and animal antibiotics. 

Through DCHC, we manufacture and sell natural gas. 

Our Corporate History 

We were incorporated in Delaware on February 28, 1989. From November 1993 through August 2006, we were engaged in the business of owning, leasing and operating coin and debit card pay-per copy photocopy machines, fax machines, microfilm reader-printers and accessory equipment under the name  Diversifax, Inc. . Due to the increased use of internet services, demand for our services declined sharply, and in August 2006, our Board of Directors decided to discontinue our operations. 

Upper Class Group Limited, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in July 2006, acquired all the outstanding stock of SCHC, a company incorporated in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, PRC, in May 2005. At the time of the acquisition, members of the family of Mr. Ming Yang, our president and former chief executive officer, owned approximately 63.20% of the outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited. Since the ownership of Upper Class Group Limited and SCHC was then substantially the same, the acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Upper Class Group Limited recognized the assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts. 

On December 12, 2006, our company, then known as Diversifax, Inc., a public  shell  company, acquired Upper Class Group Limited and SCHC. Under the terms of the agreement, the stockholders of Upper Class Group Limited received 13,250,000 (restated for the 2-for-1 stock split in 2007 and the 1-for-4 stock split in 2009) shares of voting common stock of Gulf Resources, Inc. in exchange for all outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited. Members of the Yang family received approximately 62% of our common stock as a result of the acquisition.  Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the share exchange is considered to be a capital transaction rather than a business combination. That is, the share exchange is equivalent to the issuance of stock by Upper Class Group Limited for the net assets of Gulf Resources, Inc., accompanied by a recapitalization, and is accounted for as a change in capital structure. Accordingly, the accounting for the share exchange is identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except no goodwill is recorded. Under reverse takeover accounting, the post reverse acquisition comparative historical financial statements of the legal acquirer, Gulf Resources, Inc., are those of the legal acquiree, Upper Class Group Limited. Share and per share amounts stated have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the share exchange. On February 20, 2007, we changed our corporate name to Gulf Resources, Inc.

On February 5, 2007, we acquired SYCI, a company incorporated in PRC, in October 2000. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the stockholders of SYCI received a total of 8,094,059 (restated for the 2-for-1 stock split in 2007 and the 1-for-4 stock split in 2009) shares of common stock of Gulf Resources, Inc. in exchange for all outstanding shares of SYCI's common stock. Simultaneously with the completion of the acquisition, a dividend of $2,550,000 was paid to the former stockholders of SYCI. At the time of the acquisition, approximately 49.1% of the outstanding shares of SYCI were owned by Ms. Yu, Mr. Yang s wife, and the remaining 50.9% of the outstanding shares of SYCI were owned by SCHC, all of whose outstanding shares were owned by Mr. Yang and his wife. Since the ownership of Gulf Resources, Inc. and SYCI are substantially the same, the acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Gulf Resources, Inc. recognized the assets and liabilities of SYCI at their carrying amounts. Share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the acquisition. 

To satisfy certain ministerial requirements necessary to confirm certain government approvals required in connection with the acquisition of SCHC by Upper Class Group Limited, all of the equity interest of SCHC were transferred to a newly formed Hong Kong corporation named Hong Kong Jiaxing Industrial Limited ( Hong Kong Jiaxing ) all of the outstanding shares of which are owned by Upper Class Group Limited. The transfer of all of the equity interest of SCHC to Hong Kong Jiaxing received approval from the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce on December 10, 2007. 

As a result of the transactions described above, our corporate structure is linear. That is Gulf Resources owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Upper Class Group Limited, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Jiaxing, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of SCHC, which owns 100% of the outstanding shares of SYCI. 

On October 12, 2009 we completed a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of our common stock, such that for each four shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split.

The gross profit margin for our chemical products segment for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was 36% compared to 34% for the same period in 2015. 

Research and Development Costs.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total research and development costs incurred were $198,330 and $181,108, respectively, an increase of 10%. Research and development costs for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 represented raw materials used by SYCI and SCRC for testing the manufacturing routine. 

Exploration Costs  The total exploration costs incurred for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $325,840. The Company expenses exploration costs. When the financial viability of a project is proven, the Company will capitalize all future expenses and allocate them to the business line of that project. Prior to January 30, 2015, the Company incurred a total of $7,848,873 in exploration costs for the drilling of natural gas and brine wells in Daying County of Sichuan Province. These expenses were charged to the Company s Bromine and Crude Salt sectors respectively. On January 30, 2015, the Company announced that it found natural gas resources under its bromine well in Sichuan. In early May 2015, the Company received a testing report that confirmed the economics of the natural gas under this well. 

From that point on, all expenses related to the well are included in the segment for DCHC. All relatedexpenses are being capitalized. 

The Company is constructing the related infrastructure needed to begin operations in the remote and mountainous region of Daying County. The Company expects to begin production on the first well in the first quarter of 2017. 

Write-off/Impairment on property, plant and equipment.  Write-offs on property, plant and equipment for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $90,395 and $819,701, respectively, a decrease of 89%. Write-offs on property, plant and equipment of $90,395 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 represented the write-offs of certain protective shells to transmission pipelines and ducts during the enhancement project that started in August 2016 and completed in September 2016. Write-offs on property, plant and equipment of $819,701 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 represented the write-offs of (i) certain protective shells to transmission pipelines and ducts  of $753,025  during the fourth phase enhancement project that started in August 2015 and completed in September 2015; and  (ii) certain machinery and equipment replaced during the enhancement work to our bromine production facilities in Factory No. 11 of $66,676.  

General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses were $4,539,845 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $707,473 (or 13%) as compared to $5,247,318 for the same period in 2015. This decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) a non-cash expense related to stock options granted to employees decreased from $353,300 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 to $17,400 for the same period of 2016; and   (ii) audit fee incurred in the amount of $115,000 related to the audit of SCRC acquired in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015; and (iii) incurred franchise tax fee in the amount of $211,369 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, with no such expense in 2016 due to the reincorporation of the Company from Delaware to Nev a da, which offset by the unrealized exchange gain in relation to the translation difference of inter-company balance in RMB for the nine-month period ended September 30,2016 amounted to $729,764, as compared to the unrealized exchange gain for the same period in 2015 of $1,037,429. 

Other Operating Income.  Other operating income was $328,550 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $13,767(or 4%) as compared to $342,317 for the same period in 2015 for sales of wastewater. Wastewater is generated from the production of bromine and eventually becomes crude salt when it evaporates. Not all of our bromine production plants have sufficient area on the property to allow for evaporation of wastewater to produce crude salt. Certain of our customers who have facilities located adjacent to our bromine production plants have agreed to allow us to channel our wastewater into brine pans on their properties for evaporation. These customers then are able to sell the resulting crude salt themselves. We signed agreements with four of our customers to sell them our wastewater at market prices.

Income from Operations.  Income from operations was $39,953,640 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (or 33% of net revenue), an increase of $4,378,442, or approximately 12%, over income from operations for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased bromine price and the decrease general and administrative expense incurred for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. 

Bromine segment  

Income from operations from our bromine segment was $19,103,472 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $10,152,877 (or approximately 113%) compared to the same period in 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the higher selling price of bromine in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Crude salt segment  

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations from our crude salt segment was $165,403, compared to an income of $534,760 in the same period in 2015. This loss resulted primarily from the decreased selling price of crude salt in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Chemical products segment  

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, income from operations from our chemical products segment was $20,698,116, a decrease of $5,507,462 (or approximately 21%) over same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in sales volume of all of our chemical products. 

Other Income, Net.  Other income, net of $222,678 represented bank interest income, net of capital lease interest expense for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $22,765 (or approximately 11%) as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Net Income.  Net income was $30,179,696 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $3,409,743 (or approximately 13%) compared to the same period in 2015. This significant increase was primarily attributable to the increased bromine price and the decrease general and administrative expense incurred for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. 

Effective Tax Rate.  Our effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 25% and 25%, respectively. The effective tax rate of 25% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 consistent with the PRC statutory income tax rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $141,083,587 as compared to $133,606,392 as of December 31, 2015. The components of this increase of $7,477,195 are reflected below. 

Statement of Cash Flows  

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we met our working capital and capital investment requirements mainly by using cash flow from operations and cash on hand. 

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had positive cash flow from operating activities approximately of $29.2 million and $34.9 million, respectively, primarily attributable to net income. 

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, cash flow from operating activities of approximately $29.2 million was less than our net income of approximately $30.2 million, mainly due to (i) cash using in working capital of approximately $20.0 million, which mainly consisted of the increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by the decrease in inventories, increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and tax payable; partially offset by (ii) substantial non-cash charges of approximately $19.1 million, mainly in the form of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment. 

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, cash flow from operating activities of approximately $34.9 million exceeded our net income of approximately $26.8 million, mainly due to (i) substantial non-cash charges of approximately $22.7 million, primarily in the form of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, and write-off/impairment loss on property, plant and equipment; partially offset by (ii) cash used in working capital of approximately $14.5 million, which mainly consisted of an increase in accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by the increase in taxes payable. 

Accounts receivable 

Cash collections on our accounts receivable had a major impact on our overall liquidity. The following table presents the aging analysis of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The overall accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2016 increased by $21,416,450 (or 43%), as compared to those as of December 31, 2015. Such increase is mainly attributable to the extended settlement days by customers due to the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the financial tightening, which in turn lengthened the average turnover days of accounts receivable from customers from 103 days for the fiscal year 2015 to 138 days for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. Normally, a 90 to 180-day credit period is granted to customers with good payment history. Approximately 54% of the balances of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 aged more than 90 days was settled in October 2016. We have policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and we perform ongoing credit evaluation on the financial condition of our customers. No allowance for doubtful debts for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 is required.

Inventory 

Our inventory consists of the following: 

The net inventory level as of September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,408,728 (or 20%), as compared to the net inventory level as of December 31, 2015. 

Raw materials decreased by 13% as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. All of the raw materials are basic chemical industry materials, few of which have a possibility of loss over time, or major fluctuations in their prices. We concluded that all of our raw materials as of September 30, 2016 are fully realizable for production of finished goods without any impairment. 

Our finished goods consist of bromine, crude salt and chemical products. Our chemical products are similar to raw materials, with no loss over time, a stable market price and a gross profit margin of 34% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 36% for the same period in fiscal year 2015. Therefore, we believe that the realization of the chemical products is 100%. Similarly, as there is no depletion of bromine, we believe that the realization of it is also 100%. The gross profit margin for bromine for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased to 46%, as compared with 31% for the same period in fiscal year 2015, we anticipated that the price through 2016 will not fluctuate significantly to impair the cost of bromine. 

The annual loss of crude salt due to evaporation is approximately 3%. The average selling price of crude salt per tonne decreased from $33.26 in the third quarter of 2015 to $27.99 in the same period in 2016. We believe that there will be no realization problem for crude salt as we do not expect selling price to be lower than the current price. If the selling price continues to decrease, there will be an impact on our crude salt realization value. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we used approximately $0.67 million cash for the prepayment of land leases. In the same period, we also used approximately $15.23 million cash to carry out enhancement projects to our existing bromine extraction and crude salt production facilities and $1.46 million cash for   the construction of roads and related infrastructure needed to begin operations in the remote and mountainous region of Daying county. 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we used approximately $0.7 million cash for the prepayment of land leases. We also used approximately $66.3 million to acquire SCRC. In the same period, we also used approximately $2.8 million cash in the fourth phase enhancement project related to the protective shells to transmission channels and ducts in Factory No. 10 and 11 and the enhancement work to bromine production facilities in Factory No.11. 

We also received approximately $14.1 million from the acquisition of SCRC. 

The investing activities described above were financed by opening cash balances as of December 31, 2015, and 2014, and cash generated from operation during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

We repaid approximately $0.3 million cash for our capital lease obligation for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we  used $0.04 million to repurchase 31,000 shares of common stock of the Company with the approval of the Board of Directors. 

We believe that our available funds and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs for the next twelve (12) months.

Table of Contents  

Working capital was approximately $201.2 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $174.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

We had available cash of approximately $141.1 million at September 30, 2016, most of which is in highly liquid current deposits which earn no or little interest. We intend to retain the cash for future expansion of our bromine and crude salt businesses through acquisition, enhancements to our existing bromine and crude salt business, and further development of the new resources in Sichuan Province. 

In the future we intend to focus our efforts on the activities of SCHC, SYCI, SCRC and DCHC as these segments continue to expand within the Chinese market. 

We may not be able to identify, successfully integrate or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire, or any expansion of our business. An expansion may involve a number of risks, including possible adverse effects on our operating results, diversion of management attention, inability to retain key personnel, risks associated with unanticipated events and the financial statement effect of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of operations. In addition, if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase, the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially. We may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable, under-managed, or in its early stages of development or growth. In addition, if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase, the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially. Our inability to implement and manage our expansion strategy successfully may have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Additional information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments at September 30, 2016 is provided in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. See  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19   Capital Commitment and Operating Lease Commitments . 

Material Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements falling within the definition of Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by us in the preparation of our financial statements: accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, assets retirement obligation, property, plant and equipment, recoverability of long lived assets, mineral rights, revenue recognition, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. These policies and estimates are described in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K.
