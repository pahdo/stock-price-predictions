  (Unaudited)  

1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Nature
of Operations   

TearLab
Corporation (formerly OccuLogix, Inc.)  ( TearLab  or the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is an
ophthalmic device company that is commercializing a proprietary in vitro diagnostic tear testing platform, the TearLab  test
for dry eye disease, or DED, which enables eye care practitioners to test for highly sensitive and specific biomarkers using nanoliters
of tear film at the point-of-care.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
On April 8, 2016, OcuHub Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of 10,167.5 units of OcuHub
LLC ( OcuHub ), reducing OcuHub Holdings, Inc. s ownership in OcuHub to 10.5% on a fully-diluted basis. Prior
to the sale, the accounts of OcuHub were included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. In the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of OcuHub of $75, included in Other income (expense) on the
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
on consolidation.  

Liquidity
and Going Concern    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the
Company will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, the Company has sustained substantial losses of $15,579
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $33,229 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company has implemented
plans to mitigate conditions that raise doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In February 2016,
the Company underwent a strategic restructuring, including a staff reduction of 54 positions, designed to improve the Company s
overall cost structure. In April 2016, the Company finalized the divestment of OcuHub. In May 2016, the Company issued a combination
of common stock, preferred stock, and warrants to purchase common stock for net proceeds of $15,457.  The Company s
working capital surplus at September 30, 2016, was $18,988 which represents a $4,849 increase from its working capital at December
31, 2015. Management believes the combination of restructuring the Company s cost structure, the cash provided by the equity
capital raise and anticipated cash flows provided by the sale of products, will be sufficient to fund the Company s cash
requirements for at least the next twelve months. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that
date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared using significant accounting policies that are consistent with the policies used in preparing the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The audited financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC with our annual report on Form 10-K on March 9, 2016 include a summary of our significant
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-Q. Management believes that all adjustments necessary
for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for the interim periods presented.  

TearLab Corporation  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The principal areas of judgment relate to revenue and inventory reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived
and intangible assets, and the fair value of stock options and warrants.   

Revenue
recognition    

Revenue
is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery
of the products has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
The Company s timing of revenue recognition is impacted by factors such as passage of title, payments and customer acceptance.
Amounts received in excess of revenue recognizable are deferred.  

The
Company sells its proprietary   TearLab  Osmolarity
System and related test cards to external customers, who are primarily eye care professionals, for use in osmolarity testing procedures.
Revenue is primarily derived from the sale of disposable test cards. Products are generally shipped from a distribution and warehousing
facility in California. The Company s sales are currently direct to customers in the United States and to distributors in
the rest of the world.  

The
Company enters into contracts where revenue is derived either from agreements whereby the customer is provided the right to use
the TearLab  Osmolarity System (reader equipment) at no separate cost to the customer in consideration for a minimum purchase
commitment of disposable test cards over the related contract term ( Use Agreements ,  Masters Agreements 
or  Flex Agreements ), or from agreements with separate sales of the reader equipment and disposable test cards ( Purchase
Agreements ).  

Purchase
commitments for Use Agreements and Flex Agreements are expressed in the agreement for a specified period of time (generally one
to three years). The purchase commitment for Masters Agreements is implied for large physician practices with an expectation of
purchasing certain levels of test cards. The Company recovers the cost of providing the reader equipment in the amount charged
for disposable test cards. These agreements are treated as operating leases as collectability of the minimum lease payments is
not reasonably predictable at the outset of the arrangement. Accordingly, revenue is recognized over the defined contract term
as disposable test cards are shipped. Revenue under such agreements is allocated between the lease of the reader equipment and
the sale of the disposables based upon each component s relative fair value. When reader equipment is placed with a customer
at no separate cost, the Company retains title to the equipment and it remains capitalized on the Company s Consolidated
Balance Sheet as equipment classified within fixed assets, net. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis once shipped
to a customer location over its estimated useful life and depreciation expense is included in cost of goods sold within the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  

TearLab
Corporation   

Revenue
recognition for Purchase Agreements with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist
in the contract. A delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer
on a stand-alone basis. Items are considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the
customer could resell the item on a stand-alone basis. Considering that test cards are essential to the operation of a TearLab
reader, there is no alternative vendor for the test cards and no indication that a secondary market for the TearLab readers is
established, the deliverables under the contracts do not meet criteria for separation under the multiple-element arrangements
guidance. Consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price,
as determined by the selling price of similar individual items on a stand-alone basis. The Company recognizes revenue for each
of the elements only when it determines that all applicable recognition criteria have been met.  

Although
the Company typically has a no return policy for its products, the Company has established a reserve for product sales that contain
an implicit right of return. The Company reserves for estimated returns or refunds by reducing revenue at the time of shipment
based on historical experience. The reserve of $16 and $67 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, has reduced
revenue and is included in accounts receivable.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements    

In
August 2016, the Financial Accountings Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,
Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-35 ), to reduce diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the new standard will have on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU
2016-09 ), which involves several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as liabilities or equity, and classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of the new standard will have on its financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 establishes
a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record an asset and liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. A modified
retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after,
the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard on its financial statements.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ),
which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers. Early application is not permitted. On April 1, 2015, the FASB voted to propose a deferral of the effective
date of the standard by one year which would result in the new standard being effective for the Company at the beginning of its
first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard, including
possible transition alternatives, on the Company s financial statements.

BALANCE SHEET DETAILS    

Accounts
receivable    

Inventory    

Inventory
is recorded at the lower of cost or market and consists of finished goods. Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out
basis.  

The
Company evaluates inventory for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence, based on expected future sales levels and projections
of future demand, and establishes inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories. In addition, the Company assesses the
impact of changing technology and market conditions. The Company has entered into a long-term purchase commitment to buy the test
cards from MiniFAB (Aust) Pty Ltd ( MiniFAB ). The purchase commitment contains required minimum purchases based on
periodic forecasts submitted to MiniFab, but the purchase commitment can fluctuate up or down depending on the Company s
forecast of future demand. As part of its analysis of excess or obsolete inventories, the Company considers future minimum purchases,
estimated future usage and the expiry dating of the cards to determine if any inventory reserve is needed.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

The
Company s intangible assets consist primarily of the value of TearLab  Technology acquired in the acquisition of TearLab Research,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  The TearLab Technology consists of a disposable lab card and card reader,
supported by an array of patents and patent applications that are either held or in-licensed by the Company.  The TearLab
Technology is being amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 10 years.  Amortization
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $359 and $389, respectively. Amortization expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $966 and $1,166, respectively.  

Intangible
assets subject to amortization consist of the following:

   TERM LOAN   

On
March 4, 2015, the Company executed a term loan agreement with CRG LP and certain of its affiliate funds ( CRG ) as
lenders providing the Company with access of up to $35,000 under the arrangement. The Company received $15,000 in gross proceeds
under the arrangement on March 4, 2015, and an additional $10,000 on October 6, 2015. The Term Loan Agreement matures on December
31, 2020 and bears interest at 13% per annum, with quarterly payments of interest only for the first four years. While interest
on the loan is accrued at 13% per annum, the Company may elect to make interest-only payments at 8.5% per annum. The
unpaid interest of 4.5% is added to the principal of the loan and is subject to additional accrued interest ( PIK interest ).
The accrued interest can be deferred and paid together with the principal in the fifth and sixth years.  

As
part of the amended Term Loan Agreement, and funding of the second tranche, CRG received 350,000 warrants dated as of October
6, 2015 to purchase common shares of the Company at a price of $5.00 per share (the  CRG Warrants ). The CRG Warrants
have a five-year life. The CRG Warrants are classified as equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and
September 30, 2016. The CRG Warrants were valued at their issuance date using the Black-Scholes Merton model. The related reduction
of the long-term debt will be amortized over the life of the debt.  

The
loan is collateralized by all assets of the Company. Additionally, the terms of the Term Loan Agreement contain various affirmative
and negative covenants agreed to by the Company. Among them, the Company must attain minimum certain annual revenue and minimum
cash threshold levels. On April 7, 2016, the Company amended the Term Loan Agreement to change the required minimum revenue levels.
The amended minimum revenue is $27,000 for 2016, $31,000 for 2017, $36,000 for 2018, $45,000 for 2019 and $55,000 for 2020. The
amendment also reduced the exercise price of the CRG Warrants from $5.00 per share to $1.50 per share and the Company issued CRG
additional warrants to purchase 350,000 common shares of the Company s stock at $1.50 per share, which expire 5 years after
issuance. See Note 6 for further discussion of the CRG Warrants.  

TearLab Corporation  

If
the Company does not have annual revenue greater or equal to the annual revenue covenant in a calendar year, the Company will
have the right within 90 days of the end of the respective calendar year to raise subordinated debt or equity (the  CRG
Equity Cure ) equal to twice the difference between the annual revenue and the revenue covenant, with the total proceeds
from this financing to be used to reduce the principal of the Term Loan Agreement. In the event of a default, the Company may
be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and CRG may foreclose on their security interest in the
Company s assets.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants.  

As
part of the amended Term Loan Agreement, on the earlier of the maturity date or the date the term loan is paid off in full, the
Company will pay a facility fee equal to 6.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the loan, excluding accrued PIK interest (the
 Facility Fee ). The Facility Fee is being accrued to interest expense using the effective interest method.  

The
Company incurred financing and legal fees associated with the debt of $606, which were recorded as a direct discount to the debt
and are being amortized using the effective interest method. The Company presents the debt issuance costs related to the recognized
debt liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a reduction of the liability.  

The
Term Loan Agreement provided for prepayment fees of 5% of the outstanding balance of the loan if the loan was repaid prior to
March 31, 2016. The prepayment fee is reduced 1% per year for each subsequent year until maturity.

(b)
Common and preferred shares   

On
May 9, 2016 the Company issued 18,610,900 shares of common stock, 3,291.8 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ( Preferred
Stock ) and Series A warrants to purchase 11,500,000 shares of common stock ( Series A Warrants ) for gross
proceeds of $17,250, less issuance costs of $1,793. The Preferred Stock is convertible, subject to certain limitations, into an
aggregate of 4,389,100 shares of common stock, contains no voting rights, participates in any common stock dividends, and is treated
as if converted upon any ordinary liquidation event. The common stock, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and the Series
A Warrants are all included in equity in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016. The
net proceeds were allocated to common stock, Preferred Stock, and Series A Warrants based on their relative fair values, as follows:  

On
August 2, 2016, 527.5 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock were converted into 703,334 shares of commons stock.  

(c)
Stock incentive plan   

The
Company has a stock incentive plan, the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Stock Incentive Plan ), under which up
to 7,200,000 options are available for grant to employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options. Under the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan, the exercise
price per share for an incentive stock option shall not be less than the fair market value of a share of stock on the effective
date of grant and the exercise price per share for non-statutory stock options shall not be less than 85% of the fair market value
of a share of stock on the date of grant. No option granted to a holder of more than 10% of the Company s common stock shall have
an exercise price per share less than 110% of the fair market value of a share of stock on the effective date of grant.  

Options
granted are typically service-based options. Generally, options expire 10 years after the date of grant. No incentive stock
options granted to a 10% owner optionee shall be exercisable after the expiration of five years after the effective date of grant
of such option, no option has been granted to a prospective employee, prospective consultant or prospective director prior to
the date on which such person commences service, and with the exception of an option granted to an officer, director or consultant,
no incentive option shall become exercisable at a rate less than 20% per annum over a period of five years from the effective
date of grant of such option unless otherwise approved by the Board.  

TearLab
Corporation   

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the authoritative guidance which requires that share-based payment transactions
with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over
the vesting period. The amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by subjective assumptions, including: estimates
of the Company s future volatility, the expected term for its stock options, option exercise behavior, the number of options
expected to ultimately vest, and the timing of vesting for the Company s share-based awards.  

The
following table sets forth the total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options and the employee stock purchase
plan included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):

Employee Stock Purchase Plan   

In
July 2014, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) which
was approved by the Company s stockholders in June 2014 at the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A total of 671,500 shares
of the Company s common stock are reserved for issuance under the plan, which permits eligible employees to purchase common
stock at a discount through payroll deductions.  

The
price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to 90% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or
the last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Generally, each offering under the ESPP will be for a period of six months
as determined by the Company s Board of Directors. Employees may invest up to 20% of their gross compensation through payroll
deductions. In no event may an employee purchase more than $25 worth of stock in the plan during each calendar year or purchase
more than 5,000 shares per offering period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $2
and $27 of expense, respectively, under the ESPP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
$8 and $66 of expense, respectively, under the ESPP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued
141,052 and 54,211 shares of common stock, respectively, under the ESPP.  

(e)
Warrants   

On
June 30, 2011, the Company closed a private placement financing in which 3,846,154 shares of common stock and warrants (  2011
Warrants  ) to purchase 3,846,154 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $7,000. The exercise
price of the warrants was $1.86 per share. The 2011 Warrants expired on June 30, 2016. There were 219,604 of the 2011 Warrants
that expired unexercised. Prior to their expiration, the 2011 Warrants were recorded as a liability on the Company s balance
sheet and remeasured each period using the Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model. There were no exercises of 2011 Warrants
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The liability for the 2011 Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2015
had a value of $29. The value of the 2011 Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2015 was recorded as a Change in fair value
of warrant obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, reflecting the expiration of the instruments and the associated liability.  

TearLab
Corporation   

On
October 8, 2015, as part of the second amendment to the Term Loan Agreement and funding of the $10,000 tranche, CRG received warrants
to purchase 350,000 common shares in the Company at a price of $5.00 per share (the  CRG Warrants ). The CRG Warrants
are exercisable any time prior to October 8, 2020. The CRG Warrants are classified as equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. The CRG Warrants were valued at $290 upon issuance using the Black-Scholes Merton
model assuming volatility of 73%, an expected life of 5.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.71%, and 0% dividend yield. No
CRG Warrants were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On
April 8, 2016, the Company further amended its Term Loan Agreement. As part of the amendment, the exercise price of the CRG Warrants
was changed to allow the holder to purchase 350,000 common shares in the Company at a price of $1.50 per share and CRG was issued
an additional 350,000 warrants to purchase common shares at an exercise price of $1.50 (the  2016 CRG Warrants ).
The modification to the terms of the CRG Warrants resulted in a change in fair value of $54 which was included as interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The change in fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes Merton model with
both exercise prices, assuming volatility of 76%, an expected life of 4.5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.06%, and 0% dividend
yield. The 2016 CRG Warrants were valued at $106 upon issuance using the Black-Scholes Merton model assuming volatility of 76%,
an expected life of 5.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.30% and 0% dividend yield.  

On
May 9, 2016, the Company issued Series A Warrants to purchase 11,500,000 shares of common stock for $1.125 per common share attached
to shares of common and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on the same date. The Series A Warrants can be exercised after
May 9, 2017 (the  Initial Exercise Date ) and expire 5 years after the Initial Exercise Date. Fair value of the Series
A Warrants, for purposes of allocating the net proceeds of the equity offering, was determined using the Black-Scholes Merton
model assuming volatility of 76%, an expected life of 6.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.30%, and 0% dividend yield.

Exchange Right   

In
August 2014, the Company sold membership units in OcuHub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which was a wholly owned subsidiary
of TearLab Corporation at the time, in exchange for 2% ownership of OcuHub LLC. In connection with the sale of the membership
units, the new members received an exchange right allowing the units to be exchanged upon written notice and during a specified
exchange window for shares in the Company s common stock. On March 31, 2016, the members exchanged the ownership interest
in OcuHub LLC for 385,800 shares of the Company s common stock.

NET INCOME  ( LOSS) PER SHARE   

Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and vested
restricted stock units outstanding. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss), less any dilutive
amounts recorded during the period for the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, by the weighted average number of common
shares and vested restricted stock units outstanding and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents, from
stock options, warrants, and non-vested restricted stock units. Common stock equivalents are only included in the diluted earnings
per share calculation when their effect is dilutive. Diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 includes the dilutive impact of the gain recorded from the Company s June 30, 2011 warrants.  

TearLab
Corporation   

The
following securities were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were anti-dilutive:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

On
March 7, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary, TearLab Research, Inc., entered into a supply and development agreement ( Supply
Agreement ) with MiniFAB (Aust) Pty Ltd ( MiniFAB ). The agreement is an exclusive supply agreement through
June 2021, which will provide 16% savings on the purchase and delivery of individual osmolarity test cards following a transition
period to account for ending inventory at December 31, 2015 and other elements of the prior agreement. The savings consist of
lower prices for the purchase of the test cards and for freight costs to ship the cards to the Company s distribution facility.
The lower purchase price will remain in place until the earlier of the date that the Company reaches an annual volume of 4.5 million
test cards and March 31, 2018. The savings from freight costs will remain in place throughout the agreement. The Supply Agreement
requires that, in any given 6 calendar months, the Company must place aggregate purchase orders equal to at least 50% of the orders
forecasted for that 6 month period at its onset. The Supply Agreement can be extended by either party for a term of five years
with the option for the Company to buyout the exclusive supply provision during any extended term. This Supply Agreement replaces
the July 2011 agreement between MiniFAB and the Company.  

In
April 2014, the Company guaranteed a marketing agreement entered into by OcuHub LLC, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company at the time. The underlying marketing agreement calls for an annual marketing fee of $100, with payments due quarterly
through March 31, 2019. Should OcuHub LLC fail to perform its obligations under the terms of the marketing agreement, the Company
could be required to make the $25 quarterly payments, through the March 31, 2019 initial term of the agreement. The Company has
not accrued for any liability under the guarantee.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

On
October 13, 2016, the Company and Physician Recommended Nutriceuticals ( PRN ) entered into a cooperative marketing
agreement (the  Marketing Agreement ) whereby the Company and PRN will jointly promote PRN s proprietary omega-3
formulations. PRN s marketed omega-3 formulations have been shown to reduce osmolarity levels in dry eye patients utilizing
the TearLab Osmolarity System as an objective assessment.  

The
Marketing Agreement has a 30 month term. Upon successful completion of a six month demonstration period, the Company will earn
a marketing fee based on a percentage of revenue of the promoted products that varies over both the term of the agreement and
by different customer channels. The Marketing Agreement contains an option for mutual renewal by both parties, non-compete provisions
and provisions for termination upon a change of control.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, included in Item 1 of this Report. Unless otherwise specified,
all dollar amounts are U.S. dollars.   

Overview    

We
are an  in-vitro  diagnostic company based in San Diego, California. We have commercialized a proprietary tear testing platform,
the TearLab  Osmolarity System that enables eye care practitioners to test for highly sensitive and specific biomarkers using
nanoliters of tear film at the point-of-care. Our first product measures tear film osmolarity for the diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease,
or DED.  

We
develop technologies to enable eye care practitioners to test a wide range of biomarkers (chemistries, metabolites, genes and
proteins) at the point-of-care. Commercializing and further development of that tear testing platform is now the focus of our
business.  

Our
product, the TearLab  Osmolarity System, enables the rapid measurement of tear osmolarity in the doctor s office. Osmolarity
is a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has been shown to assist in the diagnosis and disease management of DED.
Based on the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (2005-2008), prevalence of DED was 14.5% across an adult population aged 21-84, impacting
17.9% of women and 10.5% of men in the study. The innovation of the TearLab  Osmolarity System is its ability to precisely
and rapidly measure osmolarity in nanoliter volumes of tear samples, using a highly efficient and novel tear collection system
at the point of care. Historically, eye care researchers have relied on expensive instruments to perform tear biomarker analysis.
In addition to their cost, these conventional systems are slow, highly variable in their measurement readings, and not categorized
as waived by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, under regulations promulgated under the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments, or CLIA.  

The
TearLab  Osmolarity System consists of the following three components: (1) the TearLab disposable, which is a single-use microfluidic
microchip; (2) the TearLab Pen, which is a hand-held device that interfaces with the TearLab disposable; and (3) the TearLab Reader,
which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the TearLab Pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator.  

We
enter into contracts where revenue is derived either from agreements whereby the customer is provided the right to use the TearLab 
Osmolarity System at no separate cost to the customer in consideration for a minimum purchase commitment of disposable test cards
over the related contract term (referred to as either  Use Agreements ,  Masters Agreements  or  Flex
Agreements ), or from agreements with separate sales of the reader equipment and disposable test cards ( Purchase
Agreements ).  

In
October 2008, the TearLab  Osmolarity System received CE mark approval, clearing the way for sales in the European Union and
all countries recognizing the CE mark. While our current focus is on developing our business in the United States, we do have
agreements with numerous distributors for distribution of the TearLab  Osmolarity System in South America, Europe, Asia and
Australia.  

Recent
Developments    

On
October 13, 2016 the Company entered into a cooperative marketing agreement (the  Marketing Agreement)  with Physician
Recommended Nutriceuticals ( PRN ). Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement, PRN and the Company will jointly promote
PRN s proprietary omega-3 formulations, including Dry Eye Omega Benefits . The Marketing Agreement is expected to initiate
in November 2016 and has a 30 month term with an option for mutual renewals by both parties.  

TearLab Corporation  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Revenue,
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin   

Revenue   

TearLab
revenue consists of sales of the TearLab  Osmolarity System, which is a hand-held tear film test for the measurement of tear
osmolarity, a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has shown to correlate with DED.  

TearLab
revenue increased by $0.6 million or 9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase is the result of an increase in test card sales of $0.3 million when compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015 because of higher test card volume associated with more accounts on our FLEX card program. We also had an increase
of $0.3 million in reader sales when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, attributable to converting selected
accounts to a purchase model.  

TearLab
revenue increased by $2.5 million or 14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. The
increase is driven from an increase in test card sales volume representing $1.7 million of the total increase from the prior year
period as well as an increase in reader revenue of $0.9 million. The increase in test card volume in the current year is due in
part to bringing in new accounts, increasing utilization in our FLEX accounts and converting existing accounts to our FLEX card
program.  

Cost
of Sales   

TearLab
cost of sales includes costs of goods sold, warranty, and royalty costs. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs for
the manufacture of the TearLab Osmolarity System, including the costs we incur for the purchase of component parts from our suppliers,
applicable freight and shipping costs, fees related to warehousing and logistics inventory management.  

TearLab
costs of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The per unit cost savings on our test cards were offset in part by higher sales volumes.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, TearLab cost of sales decreased by $0.1 million or 1% over the same prior year fiscal
period. Per unit cost savings on our test cards were offset by the higher volume of test card sales, higher royalty costs associated
with higher sales volume and increased depreciation costs associated with more active readers in place.  

TearLab Corporation  

Gross
Profit   

TearLab
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.8 million or 25% compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase is due to a combination of higher sales volume and improved gross margin. The gross margin percentage
of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 57% as compared to 50% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Gross margin improvement for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due in part to the conversion and addition of our more
productive Flex accounts, improvements on the per unit cost of our test cards, and a two year moratorium, beginning January 1,
2016, on the 2.3% medical device excise tax on sales in the United States.  

TearLab
gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2.6 million or 29% compared to the same prior year fiscal
period. The increase is due to higher sales volume and improved gross margin. The gross margin percentage of revenue for the nine
month period ending September 30, 2016 was 56% as compared to 49% for the prior year fiscal period. The improvement in gross margin
is attributable to an increase in the make-up of accounts under the FLEX program and the moratorium in the United States on the
medical device excise tax.  

Operating
Expenses   

Sales
and Marketing Expense     

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by $1.5 million or 32% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with the comparable
period in fiscal 2015. The reduction in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to cost savings from our February 2016 organizational
restructuring and $0.2 million of cost savings from the divestiture of our OcuHub subsidiary.  

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by $3.8 million or 26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same prior
year fiscal period. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to cost savings from our February 2016 organizational
restructuring.  

Clinical,
Regulatory and Research and Development Expenses     

Total
clinical, regulatory and research and development expenses decreased $0.8 million or 44% in the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease when compared to the prior fiscal period was due
to a decrease in external product development costs related to the timing of our next generation of diagnostic products.  

Total
clinical, regulatory and research and development expenses decreased $2.1 million or 43% during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared with the comparable prior year fiscal period. The decrease is due to a decrease in external product development
costs related to the timing of our next generation of diagnostic products.  

TearLab Corporation  

General
and Administrative Expenses     

Total
general and administrative expenses decreased $1.5 million or 36% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease when compared to the prior fiscal period was primarily attributable to
$0.6 million of reduced professional services costs and $0.6 million of cost savings from the divestiture of our OcuHub subsidiary.  

Total
general and administrative expenses decreased $1.9 million or 17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with
the comparable prior year fiscal period. The decrease is due to operating cost savings of $1.1 million from the divestiture of
our OcuHub subsidiary and approximately $0.4 million of reduced professional services costs.  

Amortization
of Intangible Assets    

Amortization
expense of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $359,000, as compared to the $389,000 in the prior
year fiscal period. Amortization expense of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $966,000 compared
to $1,166,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $30,000 and $200,000 for the three and nine
month periods, respectively, resulted from the amortization of certain OcuHub related intangibles in the prior year fiscal period.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Interest
Income (Expense)    

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was from the interest for the CRG term loan. Interest expense increased
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year on larger
average balances of long-term debt outstanding during the period and because of the impact of the detachable warrants issued to
the lenders in October 2015 on interest expense.  

Changes
in Fair Value of Warrants Obligations    

The
Company records outstanding warrants considered liabilities at fair value at the end of each reporting period, resulting in an
adjustment to the warrant obligations, with any gain or loss recorded in earnings for the applicable period. The Company had no
warrants with liability treatment outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and, accordingly, had no associated
fair value adjustment during the period. The Company recorded income related to a decrease in the fair value of warrant obligations
of $17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company recorded income related to a decrease in the fair value
of warrant obligations of $29,000 and $133,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

TearLab Corporation  

Other
(net)    

Other
income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of foreign exchange transaction gains
and losses, based on fluctuations of the Company s foreign denominated currencies. The nine months ended September 30, 2016
also includes a $75,000 gain on the sale of OcuHub. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 other income (loss)
consists primarily of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also includes a
one-time gain of $147,000 on the cancellation of an accrued liability related to the acquisition of the net assets of OcuHub.

Company has sustained substantial losses of $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $33.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2015 and has a history of net cash used in its operations. We have introduced steps to reduce the rate
of our use of cash in our operations, including a strategic restructuring in February 2016 and the divestiture of our OcuHub subsidiary.
These steps contributed to reduce the net cash used in operating activities to $2.3 million and $10.7 million for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $4.3 and $18.1 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. On May 9, 2016, we issued a combination of common stock, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock in exchange
for $15.5 million in cash (net of fees and expenses) to provide cash for future operating needs. The proceeds from the issuance
of equity and the reduced amount of cash used in operations for the current three month period resulted in a working capital surplus
of $19.0 million at September 30, 2016 which represents a $4.8 million increase from our working capital at December 31, 2015.
We believe these steps taken in the first half of fiscal 2016, including the expectation that we will continue to generate cash
from the sales of our product, will provide us the liquidity necessary to support our operations for at least the next 12 months.  

Our
forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking
statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:  

whether
    and to what extent government and third-party payers agree to reimburse the TearLab    Osmolarity System;   

whether
    eye care professionals engage in the process of obtaining their CLIA waiver certification;   

the
    costs and timing of building the infrastructure to market and sell the TearLab  Osmolarity System;   

the
    cost and results of continuing development of the TearLab    Osmolarity System and next generation products;   

the
    costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and   

the
    effect of competing technological and market developments.   

TearLab Corporation  

At
the present time, our only product is the TearLab Osmolarity System, and although we have received 510(k) approval from the FDA
and a CLIA waiver approval from the FDA, at this time we do not know when we will generate revenue from the TearLab Osmolarity
System in the United States sufficient to fully fund our operations. If events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet
our plans to fund the business, we may be required to reduce operating expenses and reduce the planned levels of inventory and
fixed assets which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.  

Indebtedness    

On
March 4, 2015, we executed the Term Loan Agreement with CRG as lenders providing us with access of up to $35.0 million under the
Term Loan Agreement. We entered into a second amendment to the Term Loan Agreement with CRG on August 6, 2015. We received $15.0
million in gross proceeds under the Term Loan Agreement on March 4, 2015, and an additional $10.0 million on October 6, 2015.
We were unable to access a third tranche of $10.0 million because we did not attain at least $38.0 million in twelve month revenue
prior to June 30, 2016, as required to access the third tranche. As part of the second amendment to the Term Loan Agreement and
funding of the $10.0 million tranche, CRG received warrants to purchase 350,000 common shares in the Company at a price of $5.00
per share. The warrants have a life of five years. The Term Loan Agreement has a term of six years and bears interest at 13% per
annum, with quarterly payments of interest only for the first four years. At our option, during the first four years a portion
of the interest payments may be deferred and paid together with the principal in the fifth and sixth years.  

On
April 7, 2016, we further amended the Term Loan Agreement (the  Fourth Amendment ). The Fourth Amendment changes the
required minimum revenue levels under the Term Loan Agreement to $27.0 million, $31.0 million, $36.0 million, $45.0 million and
$55.0 million for the calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Fourth Amendment releases
the guaranty and other obligations given by OcuHub LLC under the Term Loan Agreement. The Fourth Amendment also reduced the exercise
price of the warrants to purchase 350,000 common shares in the Company issued to CRG from $5.00 per share to $1.50 per share and
CRG received an additional 350,000 warrants to purchase common shares in the Company at an exercise price of $1.50 per share.  

The
Term Loan Agreement is collateralized by all our assets. Additionally, the terms of the Term Loan Agreement contain various affirmative
and negative covenants. Among them, we must attain minimum certain annual revenue and minimum cash threshold levels. The minimum
cash balance required is $5.0 million, subject to certain conditions.  

If
we do not have annual revenue greater or equal to the annual revenue covenant in a calendar year, we will have to raise subordinated
debt or equity (the  CRG Equity Cure ) equal to twice the difference between the annual revenue and the revenue covenant,
with the total proceeds from this financing to be used to reduce the principal of the Term Loan Agreement. In the event we do
not achieve the minimum revenue threshold and cannot complete the CRG Equity Cure, we may be in default of the Term Loan Agreement.
In the event of a default, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose
on their security interest in our assets.  

TearLab Corporation  

Ongoing
Sources and Uses of Cash   

We
anticipate that our cash on hand and cash generated from increased sales of the TearLab Osmolarity System will be sufficient to
sustain our operations beyond the next 12 months. We continually evaluate various financing possibilities but we typically expect
our primary source of cash will be related to the collection of accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable collections will
be impacted by our ability to grow our point-of-care revenue.  

We
expect our primary uses of cash will be to fund our operating expenses and pursuing and maintaining our patents and trademarks.
In addition, dependent on available funds, we expect to expend cash to improve production capability of the TearLab test, to further
improve the performance of the TearLab test, and to pursue next generation products using our lab-on-a-chip technology.  

Changes
in Cash Flows   

Cash
Used in Operating Activities    

Net
cash used to fund our operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.7 million compared to $18.1
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was less than our net loss of $15.6 million primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of fixed
assets, stock-based compensation, interest deferred on our long-term debt and changes in the fair value of warrant obligations.
In aggregate, these non-cash items total $6.1 million. This was offset in part by net decreases in our working capital accounts
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was less than our net loss of $24.3 million due to the amortization of intangible assets, depreciation
of fixed assets, stock-based compensation, interest deferred on our long-term debt and changes in the fair value of warrant obligations
in the aggregate total of $6.1 million and a $0.1 million net increase in working capital accounts.  

The
net change in working capital and non-current asset balances related to operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 consists of the following:  

TearLab Corporation  

Explanations
of the more significant net changes in working capital and non-current asset balances are as follows:  

Accounts
    receivable decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of improved collections on outstanding balances.   

Inventory
    decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of a combination of reduced levels of test card inventory on
    hand and more favorable pricing for the inventory on hand.   

Accrued
    liabilities had a decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of the timing of invoices received late
    in December 2015 for professional services rendered, the payment in 2016 of amounts due to employees under the 2015 incentive
    compensation program and the company s overall reduction in spending.    

Cash
Used in Investing Activities    

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 million and $2.4 million respectively,
to acquire fixed assets, primarily TearLab Osmolarity systems.  

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities    

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $15.6 million and was almost all proceeds
from the issuance of equity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities of $14.7
million consisted primarily of $14.5 million of proceeds from the term loan.  

Off-Balance-Sheet
Arrangements    

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(1)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation
S-K.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial
statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are
those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and
other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances
change and additional information becomes known.  

There
were no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting
policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. For further clarification with regards to the Company s
specific policies for revenue recognition, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in Item 1.

Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in Item 1.  

ITEM
3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

Currency
Fluctuations and Exchange Risk    

Our
sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars with minimal sales in euros and pound sterling. Most of our expenses are denominated
in U.S. dollars, however, a minor portion of our expenses are in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and pounds sterling.
We cannot predict any future trends in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or pound sterling against
the U.S. dollar. Any strengthening of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or pound sterling in relation to the U.S. dollar
would increase the U.S. dollar cost of our operations, and affect our U.S. dollar measured results of operations. We maintain
bank accounts in Canadian dollars to meet short term operating requirements. We do not engage in any hedging or other transactions
intended to manage these risks. In the future, we may undertake hedging or other similar transactions or invest in market risk
sensitive instruments if we determine that it is advisable to offset these risks.  

Interest
Rate Risk    

Our
interest payments to CRG are based on a fixed contractual interest rate of 13%. A decrease in market interest rates would increase
the fair value of our long-term debt.  

ITEM
4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

(a)   Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on that evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as at September 30, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  

TearLab Corporation  

(b)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  

During
the third quarter of 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

From
time to time, we may be involved in various other claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations.
We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse
effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs,
diversion of management resources and other factors.  

TearLab Corporation  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.   

Risks
Relating to Our Financial Condition   

We
have limited working capital and a history of losses that raise substantial doubts as to whether we will be able to continue as
a going concern.    

We
have prepared our consolidated financial statements on the basis that we would continue as a going concern. However, we have incurred
losses in each year since our inception. We do not currently have any available borrowing under our term loan or credit facility.  

Our
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if we were not able to continue as a going
concern. If we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations, we would need to undertake a review of potential business
alternatives, which may include, but are not limited to, a merger or sale of the company or ceasing operations and winding down
the business.  

We
have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.    

We
have incurred losses in each year since our inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $508.4 million.
Our losses have resulted primarily from expenses incurred in research and development of our product candidates from the former
retina and glaucoma business divisions. We do not know when or if we will successfully commercialize the TearLab  Osmolarity
System in the United States or in international markets. As a result, and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties facing
us, it is difficult to provide the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability, if at all. Any failure
to become and remain profitable would require us to undertake a review of the potential business alternatives discussed above.  

We
may need to raise additional capital at some point in the future if we do not achieve our business objectives. Such capital, if
needed, may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require additional funding. If we issue additional
shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock,
our existing stockholders, would experience further dilution.    

We
may be required to raise additional capital from time to time in the future if we do not execute on our current business objectives
and continue to grow our revenue at a rate sufficient to fund our operations with our current cash on hand. Such financings may
involve the issuance of debt, equity and/or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities.
These financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding. Any failure to obtain
additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, our ability
to continue as a going concern and would be expected to result in a decline in our stock price. If we consummate such financings,
the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. Any issuances of our common stock,
preferred stock, or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, our capital
stock, would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders.  

TearLab Corporation  

We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our credit facility with
CRG. We may not be able to satisfy our minimum revenue and cash covenants, as required by the CRG term loan. If our annual sales
revenue levels do not meet or exceed the levels required by the CRG covenants, we will be required to raise additional equity
or subordinated debt, with the proceeds paid to reduce the outstanding principal of the CRG term loan. This financing could dilute
existing shareholders and impact the value of their investment.    

On
March 4, 2015, we executed a term loan agreement with CRG as lenders, which we refer to as the Term Loan Agreement, providing
us with access of up to $35.0 million under the Term Loan Agreement. We entered into an amendment of the Term Loan Agreement with
CRG on August 6, 2015. We received $25.0 million in gross proceeds during 2015. We were unable to access a third tranche of $10.0
million because we did not attain at least $38.0 million in twelve-month sales revenue prior to June 30, 2016, as required to
access the third tranche. We can make no assurance that we will be able to raise either additional debt financing or additional
equity capital. There can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  

Our
ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our
cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject
to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond
our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient
to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and
capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures,
sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we
would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
In addition, in the event of our breach of the Term Loan Agreement with CRG, we may not be allowed to draw additional amounts
under the agreement, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose
on their security interest in our assets.  

The
CRG loan is collateralized by all our assets. Additionally, the terms of the Term Loan Agreement contain various affirmative and
negative covenants agreed to by the Company. Among them, we must attain minimum annual revenue and minimum cash threshold levels.
The minimum annual revenue threshold levels required by the Term Loan are $27.0 million, $31.0 million, $36.0 million, $45.0 million
and $55.0 million for calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The minimum cash balance required is $5.0
million, subject to certain conditions.  

If
we do not have annual revenue greater or equal to the annual revenue covenant in a calendar year, we will have to raise subordinated
debt or equity, which we refer to as the CRG Equity Cure, equal to twice the difference between the annual revenue and the revenue
covenant, with the total proceeds from this financing to be used to reduce the principal of the Term Loan Agreement. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to achieve the annual revenue thresholds and the daily cash threshold. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to raise the financing for the CRG Equity Cure, if required. In addition, in the event of our breach of the Term
Loan Agreement with CRG, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose
on their security interest in our assets.  

Borrowings
under the Term Loan Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the non-occurrence of a material adverse change in
our business or operations (financial or otherwise), or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of obligations.  

TearLab Corporation  

Our
existing Term Loan Agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.    

Our
existing Term Loan Agreement with CRG contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness
and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of
business, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements or enter into
various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the
consent of the lender or terminate the Term Loan Agreement. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient
cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under the agreement. Furthermore, there is
no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding
under the Term Loan Agreement.  

Our
financial results may vary significantly due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in the trading price of our
common stock.    

Our
annual and quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from year-to-year
and quarter-to-quarter. The variability in our annual and quarterly results of operations may lead to volatility in our stock
price as research analysts and investors respond to these annual fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors
that are difficult to forecast, including:  

fluctuations
    in demand for our products;   

changes
    in customer budget cycles and capital spending;   

seasonal
    variations in customer operations that could occur during holiday or summer vacation periods;   

tendencies
    among some customers to defer purchase decisions until the end of the quarter;   

the
    unit value of our systems;   

changes
    in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;   

changes
    in reimbursement levels that might negatively impact our pricing policies;   

our
    ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner;   

quality
    control or yield problems at our manufacturing suppliers;   

our
    ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;   

new
    product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors;   

unanticipated
    increases in costs or expenses;   

our
    complex, variable and, at times, lengthy sales cycle;   

global
    economic conditions; and   

fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates.    

In
addition, we may experience seasonal variations in our customer operations such as could occur during holiday vacation periods.
For example, one of our principal target markets consists of private ophthalmic and optometric practices, and our operating results
in the quarter ending September 30 of each fiscal year could be adversely affected by summer vacation periods. The foregoing factors,
as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. In addition, a
significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development, and sales
and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could
magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. We expect that our sales will continue to fluctuate
on a quarterly basis and our financial results for some periods may differ from those projected by securities analysts, which
could significantly decrease the price of our common stock.  

TearLab Corporation  

Risks
Related to Our Business    

Our
near-term success is highly dependent on the success of the TearLab  Osmolarity System, and we cannot be certain that it will
be successfully commercialized in the United States.    

The
TearLab  Osmolarity System is currently our only product. Our product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant
to CE mark approval; in Canada pursuant to a Health Canada Medical Device License; and in the United States as a result of having
received 510(k) approval from the FDA to market the TearLab  Osmolarity System to those reference and physician operated laboratories
with CLIA waiver certifications. Even though the TearLab  Osmolarity System has received all regulatory approvals in the United
States, it may never generate sufficient sales to achieve profitability. If the TearLab  Osmolarity System is not as successfully
commercialized as expected, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or continue our operations.
Any failure of the TearLab  Osmolarity System to be successfully commercialized in the United States would have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows and could result in a substantial decline
in the price of our common stock.  

Our
near-term success is highly dependent on increasing sales of the TearLab  Osmolarity System outside the United States, and
we cannot be certain that we will successfully increase such sales.    

Our
product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant to CE mark approval and Health Canada Approval in Canada. Our
near-term success is highly dependent on increasing our international sales. We may also be required to register our product with
health departments in our foreign market countries. A failure to successfully register in such markets would negatively affect
our sales in any such markets. In addition, import taxes are levied on our product in certain foreign markets. Other countries
may adopt taxation codes on imported products. Increases in such taxes or other restrictions on our product could negatively affect
our ability to import, distribute and price our product.  

We
have outstanding liabilities, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures
and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, and to defend our intellectual property.    

As
of September 30, 2016, our total liabilities were $31.2 million, including $26.0 million of long-term obligations under our Term
Loan Agreement. Our significant liability service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and
may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example:  

our
    liabilities increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, and could place
    us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;   

our
    liabilities could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could
    limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow money for operations or capital in the future and implement
    our business strategies; and   

our
    liabilities may restrict us from raising additional funds on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
    product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.   

TearLab Corporation  

If
we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our liabilities when payment is due, we may be required
to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the liabilities, seek to refinance all or a portion of the
liabilities or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms,
that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or
acceptable to us.  

We
will face challenges in bringing the TearLab  Osmolarity System to market in the United States and may not succeed in executing
our business plan.    

There
are numerous risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of new medical technologies. In addition to our requirement for
additional capital, our ability to bring the TearLab  Osmolarity System to market in the United States and to execute our
business plan successfully is subject to the following risks, among others:  

Our
    clinical trials may not succeed. Clinical testing is expensive and can take longer than originally anticipated. The outcomes
    of clinical trials are uncertain, and failure can occur at any stage of the testing. We could encounter unexpected problems,
    which could result in a delay in efforts to complete clinical trials supporting our commercialization efforts.   

The
    TearLab  Osmolarity System is rated under a CLIA waiver certification which requires our customers to be certified under
    the CLIA waiver requirements to be reimbursed under Medicare, including certain parallel state requirements. If our customers
    are unwilling or unable to comply with such requirements, it could have an adverse effect on their acceptance of and on our
    ability to market the TearLab  Osmolarity System in the United States.   

Our
    suppliers and we will be subject to numerous FDA requirements covering the design, testing, manufacturing, quality control,
    labeling, advertising, promotion and export of the TearLab  Osmolarity System and other matters. If our suppliers or we
    fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, the TearLab  Osmolarity System could be subject to restrictions or
    withdrawals from the market and we could become subject to penalties.   

Even
    though we successfully obtained the sought-after FDA approvals, we may be unable to commercialize the TearLab  Osmolarity
    System successfully in the United States. Successful commercialization will depend on a number of factors, including, among
    other things, achieving widespread acceptance of the TearLab  Osmolarity System among physicians, establishing adequate
    sales and marketing capabilities, addressing competition effectively, the ability to obtain and enforce patents to protect
    proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors, key personnel retention and ensuring sufficient manufacturing capacity
    and inventory to support commercialization plans.   

Our
business is subject to health care industry and government cost-containment measures that could result in reduced sales of our
TearLab  Osmolarity System.    

Most
of our customers rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some
or all of the cost of the procedures which use our TearLab  Osmolarity System. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities,
insurance companies, and other health care payers to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain
approval for payment from these third-party payers. If patients cannot obtain third-party payer payment approval, the use of our
TearLab  Osmolarity System may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate the use of our system. The
cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could harm our ability
to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals.
While this type of discount pricing does not currently exist for the medical systems we supply, if managed care or other organizations
were able to affect discount pricing for such systems, it could result in lower prices to our customers from their customers and,
in turn, reduce the amounts we can charge our customers for our products.  

TearLab Corporation  

In
addition to general health care industry cost-containment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its final
rule implementing section 216(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) that will require reporting entities
to report private payor rates paid to laboratories for lab tests, which will be used to calculate Medicare payment rates. This
final rule also announces CMS  decision to move the implementation date for the private payor rate-based fee schedule to
January 1, 2018. Reporting entities, which would primarily be our customers in the U.S., that derive a certain percentage and
volume of their revenue from laboratory tests from Medicare, will report private payor rates for our laboratory tests which will
serve under the act as a baseline for future reimbursement. Although it is very early to understand if reimbursement for our product
or future products will be impacted, the act does provide a maximum reimbursement reduction of 10% per year for the year 2018
through 2020. For years 2021 through 2023, the maximum reduction on the reimbursement rate is 15%. Should reimbursement for our
products be reduced as a result of PAMA, this could negatively impact our pricing and commercialization of our products in the
U.S.  

If
we are subject to regulatory enforcement action as a result of our failure to comply with regulatory requirements, our commercial
operations would be harmed.    

While
we received the 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver that we were seeking, we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory requirements,
and if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, including:  

adverse
    publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;   

repair,
    replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our product;   

operating
    restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production   

delay
    or refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or of new intended uses or modifications
    to our existing product;   

refusal
    to grant export approval for our products;   

withdrawing
    510(k) clearances or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and   

criminal
    prosecution.   

If
the government initiated any of these enforcement actions, our business could be harmed.  

We
are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA s Quality System Regulation, or the QSR. The QSR is a complex
regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality
assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA must determine that the facilities which manufacture and assemble
our products that are intended for sale in the United States, as well as the manufacturing controls and specifications for these
products, are compliant with applicable regulatory requirements, including the QSR. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic
unannounced inspections. The FDA has not yet inspected our facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will pass any future FDA
inspection. Our failure, or the failure of our suppliers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR
inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations,
a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would significantly harm our available inventory
and sales and cause our business to suffer.  

TearLab Corporation  

If
we are unable to fully comply with federal and state  fraud and abuse laws,  we could face substantial penalties,
which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    

We
are subject to various laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the U.S. Anti- Kickback Statute, physician self-referral
laws (the  Stark Law ), the U.S. False Claims Act, the U.S. False Statements Statute, the Physician Payment Sunshine
Act, and state law equivalents to these U.S. federal laws, which may not be limited to government-reimbursed items and may not
contain identical exceptions. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances,
civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state health care programs, including
Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws could
have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any action against
us for violation by us or our agents or distributors of this act could have a significant impact on our business.  

If
we fail to comply with contractual obligations and applicable laws and regulations governing the handling of patient identifiable
medical information, we could suffer material losses or be adversely affected by exposure to material penalties and liabilities.    

Many,
if not all of our customers, are covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of August 1996
or HIPAA. As part of the operation of our business, we provide reimbursement assistance to certain of our customers and as a result
we act in the capacity of a business associate with respect to any patient-identifiable medical information, or PHI, we receive
in connection with these services. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements related to the handling of
patient information, including laws and regulations protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of PHI. The provisions
of HIPAA require our customers to have business associate agreements with us under which we are required to appropriately safeguard
the PHI we create or receive on their behalf. Further, we and our customers are required to comply with HIPAA security regulations
that require us and them to implement certain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of electronic PHI, or EPHI. We are required by regulation and contract to protect the security of EPHI
that we create, receive, maintain or transmit for our customers consistent with these regulations. To comply with our regulatory
and contractual obligations, we may have to reorganize processes and invest in new technologies. We also are required to train
personnel regarding HIPAA requirements. If we, or any of our employees or consultants, are unable to maintain the privacy, confidentiality
and security of the PHI that is entrusted to us, we and/or our customers could be subject to civil and criminal fines and sanctions
and we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Under the Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and recent omnibus revisions to the HIPAA regulations, we are directly subject to HIPAA s
criminal and civil penalties for breaches of our privacy and security obligations and are required to comply with security breach
notification requirements. The direct applicability of the HIPAA privacy and security provisions and compliance with the notification
requirements requires us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations.  

Our
patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors.
Companies with other patents could require us to stop using or pay to use required technology.    

Our
owned and licensed patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents to maintain trade secret protection for
our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business.  

TearLab Corporation  

We
have applied for, and intend to continue to apply for, patents relating to the TearLab  Osmolarity System and related technology
and processes. Such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued
may not provide adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be
challenged successfully. In that event, if we have a preferred competitive position because of any such patents, any preferred
position would be lost. If we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position, the TearLab  Osmolarity
System could become subject to competition from the sale of similar competing products.  

Patents
issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing patent rights against
infringers, if such enforcement is required, could be significant and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations.
There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and medical technology industries. We are currently involved in litigation defending our patent rights in Canada.
Efforts to defend our rights could incur significant costs and may or may not be resolved in our favor. We could become a party
to additional patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved in our favor,
could be substantial. Some of our would-be competitors may sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because
of their greater financial resources. Litigation also may absorb significant management time.  

Unpatented
trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our future scientific
and commercial success. Although we attempt, and will continue to attempt, to protect our proprietary information through reliance
on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants
and other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, and, in any
event, others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.  

Certain
of our patent rights are licensed to us by third parties. If we fail to comply with the terms of these license agreements, our
rights to those patents may be terminated, and we will be unable to conduct our business.  

It
is possible that a court may find us to be infringing upon validly issued patents of third parties. In that event, in addition
to the cost of defending the underlying suit for infringement, we may have to pay license fees and/or damages and may be enjoined
from conducting certain activities. Obtaining licenses under third-party patents can be costly, and such licenses may not be available
at all.  

We
may face future product liability claims.    

The
testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic and diagnostic products entail significant inherent risks of allegations
of product liability. Our past use of the RHEO System and the components of the SOLX Glaucoma System in clinical trials and the
commercial sale of those products may have exposed us to potential liability claims. Our use of the TearLab  Osmolarity System
and its commercial sale could also expose us to liability claims. All of such claims might be made directly by patients, health
care providers or others selling the products. We carry clinical trials and product liability insurance to cover certain claims
that could arise, or that could have arisen, during our clinical trials or during the commercial use of our products. We currently
maintain clinical trials and product liability insurance with aggregate annual coverage limits of $2.0 million. Such coverage,
and any coverage obtained in the future, may be inadequate to protect us in the event of successful product liability claims,
and we may not increase the amount of such insurance coverage or even renew it. A successful product liability claim could materially
harm our business. In addition, substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in the incurrence of large expenditures
and the diversion of significant resources.  

TearLab Corporation  

If
we do not introduce new commercially successful products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers
may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.    

Demand
for our products may change in ways we may not anticipate because of:  

evolving
    customer needs;   

the
    introduction of new products and technologies; and   

evolving
    industry standards.   

Without
the timely introduction of new commercially successful products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time,
in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors,
including our ability to:  

properly
    identify and anticipate customer needs;   

commercialize
    new products in a cost-effective and timely manner;   

manufacture
    and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time;   

obtain
    and maintain regulatory approval for such new products;   

differentiate
    our offerings from competitors  offerings;   

achieve
    positive clinical outcomes; and   

provide
    adequate medical and/or consumer education relating to new products.   

Moreover,
innovations generally will require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine the commercial
viability of these innovations and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations. In addition, even
if we successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products
may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences
or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.  

We
rely on a limited number of suppliers of each of the key components of the TearLab  Osmolarity System and are vulnerable to
fluctuations in the availability and price of our suppliers      products and services.    

We
purchase each of the key components of the TearLab    Osmolarity System from a limited number of third-party suppliers.
Our suppliers may not provide the components or other products needed by us in the quantities requested, in a timely manner or
at a price we are willing to pay. In the event we were unable to renew our agreements with our suppliers or they were to become
unable or unwilling to continue to provide important components in the required volumes and quality levels or in a timely manner,
or if regulations affecting the components were to change, we would be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement
supply sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative suppliers or vendors on a timely basis, or at all, which could disrupt
or delay, or halt altogether, our ability to manufacture or deliver the TearLab  Osmolarity System. If any of these events
should occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  

We
face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.    

We
face intense competition in the markets for ophthalmic products and these markets are subject to rapid and significant technological
change. We have numerous potential competitors in the United States and abroad, including one direct competitor recently launched
in Canada. We face potential competition from industry participants marketing conventional technologies for the measurement of
osmolarity and other in-lab testing technologies, and commercially available methods, such as the Schirmer Test and ocular surface
staining. Many of our potential competitors have substantially more resources and a greater marketing scale than we do. If we
are unable to develop and produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors, our operating results
will materially suffer.  

TearLab Corporation  

If
we lose key personnel, or we do not attract and retain highly qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis, it would be more
difficult for us to manage our existing business operations and to identify and pursue new growth opportunities.    

Our
success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and
management personnel. In addition, any difficulties in retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt our operations.
Future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, and to continue
to recruit, train and retain, additional qualified personnel, which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational
infrastructure. The competition for qualified personnel in the medical technology field is intense. We are highly dependent on
our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel.  

Due
to our limited resources, we may not effectively recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel. If we do not retain
key personnel or manage our growth effectively, we may not implement our business plan effectively.  

Furthermore,
we have not entered into non-competition agreements with our key employees. In addition, we do not maintain  key person 
life insurance on any of our officers, employees or consultants. The loss of the services of existing personnel, the failure to
recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, and the loss of our employees to our
competitors would harm our research and development programs and our business.  

If
we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements
on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results, our ability to operate our
business and our stock price.    

Ensuring
that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements
on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to maintain
effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and could cause the trading price of our
common stock to fall dramatically.  

Maintaining
proper and effective internal controls will require substantial management time and attention and may result in our incurring
substantial incremental expenses, including with respect to increasing the breadth and depth of our finance organization to ensure
that we have personnel with the appropriate qualifications and training in certain key accounting roles and adherence to certain
control disciplines within the accounting and reporting function. Any failure in internal controls or any errors or delays in
our financial reporting would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could have a substantial
adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.  

TearLab Corporation  

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Our management has identified control deficiencies
in the past and may identify additional deficiencies in the future.  

We
cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient
or that any changes in processes and procedures can be completed in a timely manner. In future periods, if the process required
by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 reveals material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any
such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time-consuming.
In addition, we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could cause investors
to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common
stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.  

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock    

Our
common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we cannot maintain compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing
requirements.    

In
order to maintain our listing on NASDAQ, we are required to comply with NASDAQ requirements, which include, but are not limited
to, maintaining a minimum stockholders  equity and minimum bid price requirement. In particular, we are required to (i)
maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, and we have traded below that threshold since February 2, 2016, and (ii) maintain a minimum
stockholders  equity of $2.5 million or meet alternative market capitalization or income from continuing operations tests.
On March 16, 2016, we received a notice from NASDAQ stating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
(the  Minimum Bid Price Rule ) because our common stock failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 for
30 consecutive business days. The Notice had no immediate effect on the NASDAQ listing or trading of the Company s common
stock.  

On
September 16, 2016, we received a letter from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Staff (the  Staff ). The Staff had
determined to delist our securities from the NASDAQ Capital Market due to our continued non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Rule within 180 calendar days. The Company has appealed that letter, which has stayed any de-listing actions, and has a hearing
with the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the  Panel ) scheduled for early November 2016, at which we will present our plan
to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and request an extension of time within which to comply.  

If
the Panel declines to grant us an extension of time or we fail to regain compliance with the applicable requirements, our stock
may be delisted. Delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially
leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a NASDAQ Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult
time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult
and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market could also result in
negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may
adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted,
we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements
could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in
the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter
quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate
quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from the NASDAQ
Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.  

TearLab Corporation  

If
our common stock is delisted, it would come within the definition of  penny stock  as defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions
covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect
the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders
to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital
in the future.  

The
trading price of our common stock may be volatile.    

The
market prices for, and the trading volumes of, securities of medical device companies, such as ours, have been historically volatile.
The market has experienced, from time to time, significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance
of particular companies. The market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:  

the
    results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborators and/or our competitors;   

technological
    innovations or new diagnostic products;   

governmental
    regulations and reimbursement levels;   

developments
    in patent or other proprietary rights;   

litigation;   

public
    concern regarding the safety of products developed by us or others;   

comments
    by securities analysts;   

the
    issuance of additional shares to obtain financing or for acquisitions;   

general
    market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole; and   

political
    instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism;   

failure
    to maintain our NASDAQ listing.    

In
addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of individual companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price
of our stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation often follows periods
of volatility in the overall market and market price of a particular company s securities. This litigation, if instituted
against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources.  

Because
we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if
it appreciates in value.    

We
have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention to pay any dividends in the future. We are not
profitable and may not earn sufficient revenue to meet all operating cash needs. As a result, we intend to use all available cash
and liquid assets in the development of our business. Any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at
the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements, our operating and
financial conditions and on such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, the success of an investment
in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate
in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.  

TearLab Corporation  

Warrant
holders will not be entitled to any of the rights of common stockholders, but will be subject to all changes made with respect
thereto.    

If
you hold warrants, you will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock (including, without limitation, voting
rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock), but you will be subject to all changes
affecting our common stock. You will have rights with respect to our common stock only if you receive our common stock upon exercise
of the warrants and only as of the date when you become a record owner of the shares of our common stock upon such exercise. For
example, if a proposed amendment to our charter or bylaws requires stockholder approval and the record date for determining the
stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the date that you are deemed to be the owner of the shares
of our common stock due upon exercise of your warrants, you will not be entitled to vote on the amendment; although, you will
nevertheless be subject to any changes in the powers, preferences or special rights of our common stock.  

We
can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.    

Our
certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10.0 million shares of preferred stock with designations, rights, and
preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without
stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those
of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:  

adversely
    affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;   

make
    it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us;   

discourage
    bids for our common stock at a premium;   

limit
    or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or   

otherwise
    adversely affect the market price or our common stock.

a)  
      designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under the Company s

    most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and

      all
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b)  
      any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s
