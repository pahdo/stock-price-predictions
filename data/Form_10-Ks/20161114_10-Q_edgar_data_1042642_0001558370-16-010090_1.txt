PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION   

DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our plans, objectives and strategies, growth opportunities in our industries and businesses, our expectations regarding future results, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, our estimates regarding the impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, and other trends and projections.  Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and may be identified by words such as  future,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   goal,   seek,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   predict,   will,   would,   could,   can,   may,  and similar terms.  These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and represent management s current views and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control.  Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 		 

Competition and Economic Risks 

We face intense and increasing competition from satellite television providers, cable companies and telecommunications companies, especially as the pay-TV industry has matured and bundled offers have become more prevalent, which may require us to further increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn.     

Changing consumer behavior and competition from digital media companies that provide or facilitate the delivery of video content via the Internet may reduce our gross new subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us.     

Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our business.     

Our competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us.     

Our over-the-top ( OTT ) Sling TV Internet-based services face certain risks, including, among others, significant competition.     

We face increasing competition from other distributors of unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming that may limit our ability to maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services.     

Operational and Service Delivery Risks 

If we do not continue improving our operational performance and customer satisfaction, our gross new subscriber activations may decrease and our subscriber churn may increase.     

If our gross new subscriber activations decrease, or if our subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs or retention costs increase, our financial performance will be adversely affected.     

Programming expenses are increasing and could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.     

i 

Table of Contents  

We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to this programming, our gross new subscriber activations may decline and our subscriber churn may increase.     

We may not be able to obtain necessary retransmission consent agreements at acceptable rates, or at all, from local network stations.     

We may be required to make substantial additional investments to maintain competitive programming offerings.     

Any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems, including without limitation those caused by cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, could disrupt or harm our business.     

We currently depend on EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, or EchoStar, to design, develop and manufacture substantially all of our new DISH branded pay-TV set-top boxes and certain related components, to provide the vast majority of our transponder capacity, to provide digital broadcast operations and other services to us, and to provide streaming delivery technology and infrastructure for our Sling TV services.  Our business would be adversely affected if EchoStar ceases to provide these products and services to us and we are unable to obtain suitable replacement products and services from third parties.     

Technology in the pay-TV industry changes rapidly, and our success may depend in part on our timely introduction and implementation of, and effective investment in, new competitive products and services and more advanced equipment, and our failure to do so could cause our products and services to become obsolete and could negatively impact our business.     

We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.     

Our primary supplier of new set-top boxes, EchoStar, relies on a few suppliers and in some cases a single supplier, for many components of our new set-top boxes, and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business.     

Our programming signals are subject to theft, and we are vulnerable to other forms of fraud that could require us to make significant expenditures to remedy.     

We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a significant percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations.     

We have limited satellite capacity and failures or reduced capacity could adversely affect our DISH branded pay-TV business.     

Our owned and leased satellites are subject to construction, launch, operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.     

We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and could face significant impairment charges if any of our owned satellites fail.     

We may have potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar due to our and DISH Network s common ownership and management.     

ii 

Table of Contents  

We rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may negatively affect our business.     

Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks 

Our parent, DISH Network, has made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets.  In addition, DISH Network has made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses.     

Our parent, DISH Network, faces certain risks related to its non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.     

To the extent that our parent, DISH Network, commercializes its wireless spectrum licenses, it will face certain risks entering and competing in the wireless services industry and operating a wireless services business.     

We may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.     

We may need additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.     

We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt.     

Our parent, DISH Network, is controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.     

Legal and Regulatory Risks 

A ruling in the Do Not Call litigation requiring us to pay substantial civil penalties and/or damages and/or enjoining us, whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from certain activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.      

Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.     

We are party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.     

Our ability to distribute video content via the Internet, including our Sling TV services, involves regulatory risk.     

Changes in the Cable Act of 1992 ( Cable Act ), and/or the rules of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) that implement the Cable Act, may limit our ability to access programming from cable-affiliated programmers at nondiscriminatory rates.     

The injunction against our retransmission of distant networks, which is currently waived, may be reinstated.     

We are subject to significant regulatory oversight, and changes in applicable regulatory requirements, including any adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, could adversely affect our business.     

iii 

Table of Contents  

Our business depends on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted.     

We are subject to digital high-definition ( HD )  carry-one, carry-all  requirements that cause capacity constraints.     

Our business, investor confidence in our financial results, and DISH Network s stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.     

We may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.     

Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  10-K ) filed with the SEC, those discussed in  Management s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations  herein and in the 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC.  All cautionary statements made or referred to herein should be read as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear.  Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties described or referred to herein and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 

Unless otherwise required by the context, in this report, the words  DISH DBS,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to DISH DBS Corporation and its subsidiaries,  DISH Network  refers to DISH Network Corporation, our parent company, and its subsidiaries, including us, and  EchoStar  refers to EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries.

1.  Organization and Business Activities   

Principal Business 

DISH DBS Corporation (which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as  DISH DBS,  the  Company,   we,   us  and/or  our  unless otherwise required by the context) is a holding company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network Corporation ( DISH Network ).  DISH DBS was formed under Colorado law in January 1996 and its common stock is held by DISH Orbital Corporation ( DOC ), a direct subsidiary of DISH Network.    We offer pay-TV services under the DISH      brand and the Sling      brand (collectively  Pay-TV  services).  The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ) and Fixed Satellite Service ( FSS ) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, third-party broadcast operations, customer service facilities, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations.  The Sling branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, live, linear streaming over-the-top ( OTT ) Internet-based domestic, international and Latino video programming services ( Sling TV ).  The Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld) was launched prior to 2015, which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers.  During February and June 2015, we launched our Sling domestic and Sling Latino services, respectively.    In addition to these Sling TV services that may only be streamed on one device at a time (single-stream services), on April 13, 2016, we launched a live beta multi-stream Sling domestic service, which includes, among other things, the ability to stream on up to three devices simultaneously.  During June 2016, our multi-stream Sling domestic service transitioned from its introductory beta period and was re-branded as Sling Blue.  Meanwhile, we re-branded our single stream Sling domestic service as Sling Orange.  All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count.  As of September 30, 2016, we had 13.643 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States. 		 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information.  Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required for complete financial statements prepared under GAAP.  In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Our results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 		 

Principles of Consolidation 

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries, investments in entities in which we have controlling influence and variable interest entities where we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary.  Minority interests are recorded as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests.  See below for further information.  Non-consolidated investments are accounted for using the equity method when we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the investee.  When we do not have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of an investee, the cost method is used.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests    

Sling TV.    On May 2, 2014, DISH Network contributed its equity interest in Sling TV Holding L.L.C. ( Sling TV Holding,  formerly known as DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.) to us.  As a result, all operating activities of Sling TV Holding are included in our financial results beginning May 2, 2014.  Effective August 1, 2014, EchoStar Corporation ( EchoStar ) and Sling TV Holding entered into an exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV Holding distributed certain assets to EchoStar and EchoStar reduced its interest in Sling TV Holding to a ten percent non-voting interest.  EchoStar s ten percent non-voting interest is redeemable contingent on a certain performance goal being achieved by Sling TV Holding.  In addition, subject to certain conditions, the interest is redeemable at fair value within sixty days following the fifth anniversary of the Exchange Agreement.  This interest is considered temporary equity and is recorded as  Redeemable noncontrolling interests  in the mezzanine section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  EchoStar s redeemable noncontrolling interest in Sling TV Holding was initially accounted for at fair value.  The performance goal has been determined to be probable of achievement.  Accordingly, the value of EchoStar s redeemable noncontrolling interest in Sling TV Holding is adjusted each reporting period for any change in redemption value above the initial fair value (adjusted for the operating results of Sling TV Holding attributable to EchoStar subsequent to August 1, 2014), with the offset recorded in  Additional paid-in capital,  net of deferred taxes, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The operating results of Sling TV Holding attributable to EchoStar are recorded as  Redeemable noncontrolling interests  in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets effective August 1, 2014, with the offset recorded in  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax  on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  See Note 10 for further information on Sling TV Holding and the Exchange Agreement. 		 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense for each reporting period.  Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, allowances for doubtful accounts, self-insurance obligations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, fair value of options granted under our stock-based compensation plans, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, fair value of multi-element arrangements, capital leases, asset impairments, estimates of future cash flows used to evaluate impairments, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, retailer incentives, programming expenses and subscriber lives.  Economic conditions may increase the inherent uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions indicated above.  Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur. 		 

Fair Value Measurements 

We determine fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Market or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs. We apply the following hierarchy in determining fair value: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;     

Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; and  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and

Table of Contents  

DISH DBS CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       Continued 

(Unaudited) 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other participants therefore requiring assumptions based on the best information available.     

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts) and current liabilities (excluding the  Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations ) is equal to or approximates fair value due to their short-term nature or proximity to current market rates.  See Note 4 for the fair value of our marketable investment securities. 

Fair values for our publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices, when available.  The fair values of private debt are estimated based on an analysis in which we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information.  In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding, among other things, credit spreads, and the impact of these factors on the value of the debt securities.  See Note 7 for the fair value of our long-term debt. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ).  This converged standard on revenue recognition was issued jointly with the International Accounting Standards Board to create common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  ASU 2014-09 provides a framework for revenue recognition that replaces most existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective.  ASU 2014-09 allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.  We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  We have not yet selected an adoption method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.  The new standard could impact revenue and cost recognition for a significant number of our contracts, as well as our business processes and information technology systems.  As a result, our evaluation of the effect of the new standard will likely extend over several future periods.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral on the effective date for implementation of this standard, which changed the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. 		 

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  .  On January 5,  2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01     Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 )  ,    which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.    This amendment requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee).  This standard   will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of   ASU 2016-01 will have on our condensed consolidated   financial statements. 		 

Leases.    On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which relates to the accounting of leasing transactions.  This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net earnings.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Statement of Cash Flows - Update  .  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued an update to ASC 230   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ).  This update consists of eight provisions that provide guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments.  If practicable, this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  For the provisions that are impracticable to apply retrospectively, those provisions may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  This update will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 		 

Compensation   Stock Compensation.    On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09   Compensation   Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 )  ,    which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments.  This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including:  (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  During the third quarter 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which had an immaterial impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 		 

3.  Supplemental Data - Statements of Cash Flows 

The following table presents our supplemental cash flow and other non-cash data. 

Our parent, DISH Network, provides a centralized system for the management of our cash and marketable investment securities as it does for all of its subsidiaries, among other reasons, to maximize yield of the portfolio.  As a result, the cash and marketable investment securities included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is a component or portion of the overall cash and marketable investment securities portfolio included on DISH Network s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and managed by DISH Network.  We are reflecting the purchases and sales of marketable investment securities on a net basis for each period presented on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as we believe the net presentation is more meaningful to our cash flows from investing activities.

4.  Marketable Investment Securities, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Other Investment Securities 

Our marketable investment securities, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and other investment securities consisted of the following: 

(1) 

Restricted marketable investment securities and restricted cash and cash equivalents are included in  Restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

Marketable Investment Securities 

Our marketable investment securities portfolio consists of various debt and equity instruments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. 

Current Marketable Investment Securities  

Our current marketable investment securities portfolio includes investments in equity securities and various debt instruments including, among others, commercial paper, corporate securities and U.S. treasury and/or agency securities.  

Commercial paper consists mainly of unsecured short-term, promissory notes issued primarily by corporations with maturities ranging up to 365 days.  Corporate securities consist of debt instruments issued by corporations with various maturities normally less than 18 months.  U. S. Treasury and agency securities consist of debt instruments issued by the federal government and other government agencies. 

Restricted Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Investment Securities 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our restricted marketable investment securities, together with our restricted cash and cash equivalents, included amounts required as collateral for our letters of credit.

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in securities that are not publicly traded depends on the success of the issuers  businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital, on acceptable terms or at all, and to execute their business plans.  Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. 

Investment in Tracking Stock 

On February 20, 2014, we entered into agreements with EchoStar to implement a transaction pursuant to which, among other things:  (i) on March 1, 2014, we transferred to EchoStar and Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation ( HSSC ), a subsidiary of EchoStar, five satellites (EchoStar I, EchoStar VII, EchoStar X, EchoStar XI and EchoStar XIV (collectively the  Transferred Satellites ), including related in-orbit incentive obligations and cash interest payments of approximately $59 million), and approximately $11 million in cash in exchange for an aggregate of 6,290,499 shares of  a series of preferred tracking stock issued by EchoStar and an aggregate of 81.128 shares of  a series of preferred tracking stock issued by HSSC (collectively, the  Tracking Stock ); and (ii) beginning on March 1, 2014, we lease back certain satellite capacity on the Transferred Satellites (collectively, the  Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction ).  As of November 30, 2015, we no longer lease satellite capacity on the EchoStar I satellite.  The Tracking Stock generally tracks the residential retail satellite broadband business of Hughes Network Systems, LLC ( HNS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSSC, including without limitation the operations, assets and liabilities attributed to the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business (collectively, the  Hughes Retail Group ).  The shares of the Tracking Stock issued to us represent an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group. 		 

Since the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction is among entities under common control, we recorded the Tracking Stock at EchoStar s and HSSC s historical cost basis for these instruments of $229 million and $87 million, respectively.  The difference between the historical cost basis of the Tracking Stock received and the net carrying value of the Transferred Satellites of $356 million (including debt obligations, net of deferred taxes), plus the $11 million in cash, resulted in a $51 million capital transaction recorded in  Additional paid-in capital  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Although our investment in the Tracking Stock represents an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, we have no operational control or significant influence over the Hughes Retail Group business, and currently there is no public market for the Tracking Stock.  As such, the Tracking Stock is accounted for under the cost method of accounting.   		 

On February 20, 2014, DISH Operating L.L.C. ( DOLLC ) and DISH Network L.L.C. ( DNLLC ), each indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of us, entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with EchoStar and HSSC with respect to the Tracking Stock (the  Investor Rights Agreement ).  The Investor Rights Agreement provides, among other things, certain information and consultation rights for us; certain transfer restrictions on the Tracking Stock and certain rights and obligations to offer and sell under certain circumstances (including a prohibition on transfers of the Tracking Stock for one year, with continuing transfer restrictions (including a right of first offer in favor of EchoStar) thereafter, an obligation to sell the Tracking Stock to EchoStar in connection with a change of control of DISH Network and a right to require EchoStar to repurchase the Tracking Stock in connection with a change of control of EchoStar, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions); certain registration rights; certain obligations to provide conversion and exchange rights of the Tracking Stock under certain circumstances; and certain protective covenants afforded to holders of the Tracking Stock.  The Investor Rights Agreement generally will terminate with respect to our interest should we no longer hold any shares of the HSSC-issued Tracking Stock and any registrable securities under the Investor Rights Agreement.

8.  Commitments and Contingencies 

Commitments 

DISH Network Spectrum 

DISH Network has invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets.  DISH Network will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly.  DISH Network may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize its wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers.   

Auction 1000.    On February 10, 2016, DISH Network filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the forward auction phase of the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction in the 600 MHz frequency range ( Auction 1000 ).  The available spectrum in each licensed geographic area in Auction 1000 is generally comprised of certain paired 5x5 spectrum blocks (5 MHz uplink spectrum and 5 MHz downlink spectrum).  As a result, a nationwide footprint may be obtained by aggregating a single 5x5 spectrum block in each available licensed geographic area. 

Auction 1000 has had multiple stages, with each stage having two phases.  With respect to each stage, in the first phase, or reverse auction phase, participating television broadcasters  sell  their rights to use certain broadcast television spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range to the FCC.  Then following the first phase of a stage, in the second phase, or forward auction phase, the FCC will  resell  that spectrum to auction participants.  In the event that certain criteria are not met within a particular stage for Auction 1000 to conclude, Auction 1000 then proceeds to a subsequent stage with less available spectrum than the immediately preceding stage and lower spectrum clearing targets.

Before the forward auction phase of Stage 1 of Auction 1000 began, a qualified bidder in the forward auction phase could make an upfront deposit of up to approximately $5.4 billion.  On July 15, 2016, the FCC announced that a subsidiary of DISH Network and 61 other applicants were qualified to participate in the forward auction phase of Auction 1000.  The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be  anonymous,  which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant s upfront deposits or its bids.  In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000.  

Stage 1:    The reverse auction phase of Stage 1 began on March 29, 2016 and concluded on June     29,     2016.  Pursuant to the FCC s procedures for Auction 1000 and based on the results of the reverse auction phase of Stage 1, in order for Auction 1000 to have concluded, the aggregate bids in the forward auction phase of Stage 1 would have had to have exceeded approximately $88.4 billion.  The forward auction phase of Stage 1 included 100 MHz of spectrum in over 90% of the available licensed geographic areas, based on the broadcasters  indicated availability of spectrum in the reverse auction phase.  The forward auction phase of Stage 1 commenced on August 16, 2016 and concluded on August 30, 2016, but the aggregate bids of approximately $23.1 billion did not exceed the approximately $88.4 billion required for Auction 1000 to conclude.  As a result, Auction 1000 moved to Stage 2.        

Stage 2:    The reverse auction phase of Stage 2 began on September 13, 2016 and concluded on October 13, 2016.  Pursuant to the FCC s procedures for Auction 1000 and based on the results of the reverse auction phase of Stage 2, in order for Auction 1000 to have concluded, the aggregate bids in the forward auction phase of Stage 2 would have had to have exceeded approximately $56.5 billion.  The forward auction phase of Stage 2 included 90 MHz of spectrum in over 90% of the available licensed geographic areas, based on the broadcasters  indicated availability of spectrum in the reverse auction phase.  The forward auction phase of Stage 2 commenced and concluded on October 19, 2016, but the aggregate bids of approximately $21.5 billion did not exceed the approximately $56.5 billion required for Auction 1000 to conclude.  As a result, Auction 1000 moved to Stage 3.       

In connection with the development of DISH Network s wireless business, including without limitation the efforts described above, we have made cash distributions to partially finance these efforts to date and may make additional cash distributions to finance in whole or in part DISH Network s future efforts.  See Note 10 for further information regarding our dividends to DOC.  There can be no assurance that DISH Network will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that DISH Network will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses.   

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses 

Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. ( American II ) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. ( American III ), DISH Network has made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, LLC ( Northstar Spectrum ), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, LLC ( Northstar Wireless,  and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the  Northstar Entities ), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC ( SNR HoldCo ), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC ( SNR Wireless,  and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the  SNR Entities ), respectively.  On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the  AWS-3 Licenses ) to Northstar Wireless (the  Northstar Licenses ) and to SNR Wireless (the  SNR Licenses ), respectively.  DISH Network may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses.  Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly.

In connection with certain funding obligations related to the investments by American II and American III discussed above, in February 2015, we paid a dividend of $8.250 billion to DOC for, among other things, general corporate purposes, which included such funding obligations, and to fund other DISH Network cash needs.  We may make additional cash distributions to finance in whole or in part loans that DISH Network may make to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities in the future related to DISH Network s non-controlling investments in these entities.  There can be no assurance that DISH Network will be able to obtain a profitable return on its non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. 

We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, make additional cash distributions to DISH Network, continue investing in our business and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions.   

See Note 10    Commitments and Contingencies   Commitments    in the Notes to     DISH Network s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 for further information. 

Guarantees 

During the third quarter 2009, EchoStar entered into a satellite transponder service agreement for Nimiq 5 through 2024.  We sublease this capacity from EchoStar and DISH Network guarantees a certain portion of EchoStar s obligation under its satellite transponder service agreement through 2019.  As of September 30, 2016, the remaining obligation of the DISH Network guarantee was $206 million.  As of September 30, 2016, DISH Network has not recorded a liability on the balance sheet for this guarantee. 

Contingencies 

Separation Agreement 

On January 1, 2008, DISH Network completed the distribution of its technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the  Spin-off ) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar.  In connection with the Spin-off, DISH Network entered into a separation agreement with EchoStar that provides, among other things, for the division of certain liabilities, including liabilities resulting from litigation.  Under the terms of the separation agreement, EchoStar has assumed certain liabilities that relate to its business, including certain designated liabilities for acts or omissions that occurred prior to the Spin-off.  Certain specific provisions govern intellectual property related claims under which, generally, EchoStar will only be liable for its acts or omissions following the Spin-off and DISH Network will indemnify EchoStar for any liabilities or damages resulting from intellectual property claims relating to the period prior to the Spin-off, as well as our acts or omissions following the Spin-off. 		 

Litigation 

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business activities.  Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these proceedings seek an indeterminate amount of damages.  We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and to determine if accruals are appropriate.  If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss can be made.

For certain cases described on the following pages, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss because, among other reasons, (i) the proceedings are in various stages; (ii) damages have not been sought; (iii) damages are unsupported and/or exaggerated; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties (as with many patent-related cases).  For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 		 

California Institute of Technology 

On October 1, 2013, the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) filed complaints against DISH Network and its wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and dishNET Satellite Broadband L.L.C., as well as Hughes Communications, Inc. and Hughes Network Systems, LLC, which are subsidiaries of EchoStar, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The complaint alleged infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781 and 8,284,833, each of which is entitled  Serial Concatenation of Interleaved Convolutional Codes forming Turbo-Like Codes.   Caltech alleged that encoding data as specified by the DVB-S2 standard infringed each of the asserted patents.  In the operative Amended Complaint, served on March 6, 2014, Caltech claimed that our Hopper      set-top box, as well as the Hughes defendants  satellite broadband products and services, infringed the asserted patents by implementing the DVB-S2 standard.  On May 5, 2015, the Court granted summary judgment in our favor as to the Hopper set-top box alleged in the complaint.  On February 17, 2015, Caltech filed a new complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting the same patents against the same defendants.  Caltech alleged that certain broadband equipment, including without limitation the HT1000 and HT1100 modems, gateway hardware, software and/or firmware that the Hughes defendants provide to, among others, us for our use in connection with the dishNET branded broadband service, infringed these patents.  Pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties, on May 31, 2016, Caltech dismissed with prejudice all of its claims in these actions. 		 

ClearPlay, Inc. 

On March 13, 2014, ClearPlay, Inc. ( ClearPlay ) filed a complaint against DISH Network, our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C., EchoStar, and its wholly-owned subsidiary EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., in the United States District Court for the District of Utah.  The complaint alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,898,799 (the  799 patent ), entitled  Multimedia Content Navigation and Playback  7,526,784 (the  784 patent ), entitled  Delivery of Navigation Data for Playback of Audio and Video Content  7,543,318 (the  318 patent ), entitled  Delivery of Navigation Data for Playback of Audio and Video Content  7,577,970 (the  970 patent ), entitled  Multimedia Content Navigation and Playback  and 8,117,282 (the  282 patent ), entitled  Media Player Configured to Receive Playback Filters From Alternative Storage Mediums.   ClearPlay alleges that the AutoHop      feature of our Hopper set-top box infringes the asserted patents.  On February 11, 2015, the case was stayed pending various third-party challenges before the United States Patent and Trademark Office regarding the validity of certain of the patents asserted in the action.  In those third-party challenges, the United States Patent and Trademark Office found that all claims of the 282 patent are unpatentable, and that certain claims of the 784 patent and 318 patent are unpatentable.  ClearPlay appealed as to the 784 patent and the 318 patent, and on August 23, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the findings of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  On October 31, 2016, the stay was lifted. 		 

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

On the same day, CRFD filed similar complaints against AT T Inc.; Comcast Corp.; DirecTV; Time Warner Cable Inc.; Cox Communications, Inc.; Akamai Technologies, Inc.; Cablevision Systems Corp. and Limelight Networks, Inc.  CRFD is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.  On January 26, 2015, we and EchoStar filed a petition before the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of certain claims of the 233 patent.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office has agreed to institute a proceeding on our petition, as well as on two third-party petitions challenging the validity of certain claims of the 233 patent, and it heard oral argument on January 16, 2016.  On June 1, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office found that all claims asserted against us and the EchoStar parties were unpatentable.  On July 5, 2016, CRFD filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The litigation in the District Court has been stayed since June 4, 2015 pending resolution of our petition to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 		 

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. 

Customedia Technologies, L.L.C. 

On February 10, 2016, Customedia Technologies, L.L.C. ( Customedia ) filed a complaint against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The complaint alleges infringement of four patents:  United States Patent No. 8,719,090; United States Patent No. 9,053,494; United States Patent No. 7,840,437; and United States Patent No. 8,955,029.  Each patent is entitled  System for Data Management And On-Demand Rental And Purchase Of Digital Data Products.   Customedia appears to allege infringement in connection with our addressable advertising services, our DISH Anywhere feature, and our Pay-Per-View and video-on-demand offerings.  Customedia is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein. 

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. 

Do Not Call Litigation 

On March 25, 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. was sued in a civil action by the United States Attorney General and several states in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule ( TSR ), as well as analogous state statutes and state consumer protection laws.  The plaintiffs allege that we, directly and through certain independent third-party retailers and their affiliates, committed certain telemarketing violations.  On December 23, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, which indicated for the first time that the state plaintiffs were seeking civil penalties and damages of approximately $270 million and that the federal plaintiff was seeking an unspecified amount of civil penalties (which could substantially exceed the civil penalties and damages being sought by the state plaintiffs).  The plaintiffs were also seeking injunctive relief that if granted would, among other things, enjoin DISH

Network L.L.C., whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from placing any outbound telemarketing calls to market or promote its goods or services for five years, and enjoin DISH Network L.L.C. from accepting activations or sales from certain existing independent third-party retailers and from certain new independent third-party retailers, except under certain circumstances.  We also filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of all claims.  On December 12, 2014, the Court issued its opinion with respect to the parties  summary judgment motions.  The Court found that DISH Network L.L.C. is entitled to partial summary judgment with respect to one claim in the action.  In addition, the Court found that the plaintiffs are entitled to partial summary judgment with respect to ten claims in the action, which includes, among other things, findings by the Court establishing DISH Network L.L.C. s liability for a substantial amount of the alleged outbound telemarketing calls by DISH Network L.L.C. and certain of its independent third-party retailers that were the subject of the plaintiffs  motion.  The Court did not issue any injunctive relief and did not make any determination on civil penalties or damages, ruling instead that the scope of any injunctive relief and the amount of any civil penalties or damages are questions for trial.   		 

In pre-trial disclosures, the federal plaintiff indicated that it intended to seek up to $900 million in alleged civil penalties, and the state plaintiffs indicated that they intended to seek as much as $23.5 billion in alleged civil penalties and damages.  The plaintiffs also modified their request for injunctive relief.  Their requested injunction, if granted, would enjoin DISH Network L.L.C. from placing outbound telemarketing calls unless and until:  (i) DISH Network L.L.C. hires a third-party consulting organization to perform a review of its call center operations; (ii) such third-party consulting organization submits a telemarketing compliance plan to the Court and the federal plaintiff; (iii) the Court holds a hearing on the adequacy of the plan; (iv) if the Court approves the plan, DISH Network L.L.C. implements the plan and verifies to the Court that it has implemented the plan; and (v) the Court issues an order permitting DISH Network L.L.C. to resume placing outbound telemarketing calls.   The plaintiffs  modified request for injunctive relief, if granted, would also enjoin DISH Network L.L.C. from accepting customer orders solicited by certain independent third-party retailers unless and until a similar third-party review and Court approval process was followed with respect to the telemarketing activities of its independent third-party retailer base to ensure compliance with the TSR. 		 

The first phase of the bench trial took place January 19, 2016 through February 11, 2016.  In closing briefs, the federal plaintiff indicated that it still is seeking $900 million in alleged civil penalties; the California state plaintiff indicated that it is seeking $100 million in alleged civil penalties and damages for its state law claims (in addition to any amounts sought on its federal law claims); the Ohio state plaintiff indicated that it is seeking approximately $10 million in alleged civil penalties and damages for its state law claims (in addition to any amounts sought on its federal law claims); and the Illinois and North Carolina state plaintiffs did not state the specific alleged civil penalties and damages that they are seeking; but the state plaintiffs have taken the general position that any damages award less than $1.0 billion (presumably for both federal and state law claims) would not raise constitutional concerns.  Under the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, excessive fines may not be imposed. 		 

On October 3, 2016, the plaintiffs further modified their request for injunctive relief, and are now seeking, among other things, to enjoin DISH Network L.L.C., whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from placing any outbound telemarketing calls to market or promote its goods or services for five years, and enjoin DISH Network L.L.C. from accepting activations or sales from some or all existing independent third-party retailers.  The second phase of the bench trial, which   commenced on October 25, 2016 and concluded on November 2, 2016, covered the plaintiffs  requested injunctive relief, as well as certain evidence   related to the state plaintiffs    claims. 

We may also from time to time be subject to private civil litigation alleging telemarketing violations.  For example, a portion of the alleged telemarketing violations by an independent third-party retailer at issue in the case described above are also the subject of a certified class action filed against DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.  Trial in that action is scheduled to commence on January 9, 2017. 

We intend to vigorously defend these cases.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of these suits or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

On June 15, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office entered an order that the patent claims being asserted against DISH Network L.L.C. with respect to the 444 patent are unpatentable.

Grecia 

On March 27, 2015, William Grecia ( Grecia ) filed a complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,533,860 (the  860 patent ), which is entitled  Personalized Digital Media Access System PDMAS Part II.   Grecia alleges that we violate the 860 patent in connection with our digital rights management.  Grecia is the named inventor on the 860 patent.  On June 22, 2015, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  On November 18, 2015, Grecia filed an amended complaint adding allegations that we infringe U.S. Patent No. 8,402,555 (the  555 patent ), which is entitled  Personalized Digital Media Access System (PDMAS).

On February 3, 2016, Grecia filed a new complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,887,308 (the  308 patent ), which is entitled  Digital Cloud Access PDMAS Part III,  on which Grecia is also the named inventor.  Grecia alleges that we violate the 308 patent in connection with our DISH Anywhere feature.  On July 29, 2016, DISH Network L.L.C. filed a petition before the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of certain claims of the 308 patent.  The litigation in the District Court has been stayed since June 13, 2016 pending resolution of DISH Network L.L.C. s petition to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

The Hopper Litigation 

On May 24, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DISH Network L.L.C., filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.; CBS Corporation; Fox Entertainment Group, Inc.; Fox Television Holdings, Inc.; Fox Cable Network Services, L.L.C. and NBCUniversal, LLC.  In the lawsuit, we sought a declaratory judgment that we are not infringing any defendant s copyright, or breaching any defendant s retransmission consent agreement, by virtue of the PrimeTime Anytime  and AutoHop features of our Hopper set-top box.  A consumer can use the PrimeTime Anytime feature, at his or her option, to record certain primetime programs airing on ABC, CBS, Fox, and/or NBC up to every night, and to store those recordings for up to eight days.  A consumer can use the AutoHop feature, at his or her option, to watch certain recordings that the subscriber made with our PrimeTime Anytime feature, commercial-free, if played back at a certain point after the show s original airing. 		 

Later on May 24, 2012, (i) Fox Broadcasting Company; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. and Fox Television Holdings, Inc. filed a lawsuit against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the PrimeTime Anytime feature, the AutoHop feature, as well as Slingbox placeshifting functionality infringe their copyrights and breach their retransmission consent agreements, (ii) NBC Studios LLC; Universal Network Television, LLC; Open 4 Business Productions LLC and NBCUniversal, LLC filed a lawsuit against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the PrimeTime Anytime feature and the AutoHop feature infringe their copyrights, and (iii) CBS Broadcasting Inc.; CBS Studios Inc. and Survivor Productions LLC filed a lawsuit against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the PrimeTime Anytime feature and the AutoHop feature infringe their copyrights. 		 

As a result of certain parties  competing venue-related motions brought in both the New York and California actions, and certain networks  filing various counterclaims and amended complaints, the claims have proceeded in the following venues:  (1) the copyright and contract claims regarding the ABC and CBS parties in New York; and (2) the copyright and contract claims regarding the Fox and NBC parties in California. 

California Actions.    The NBC plaintiffs and Fox plaintiffs filed amended complaints in their respective California actions, adding copyright claims against EchoStar and EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar.  In addition, the Fox plaintiffs  amended complaint added claims challenging the Hopper Transfers  feature of our second-generation Hopper set-top box. 

On November 7, 2012, the California court denied the Fox plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Hopper set-top box s PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features, and the Fox plaintiffs appealed.  On March 27, 2013, at the request of the parties, the Central District of California granted a stay of all proceedings in the action brought by the NBC plaintiffs, pending resolution of the appeal by the Fox plaintiffs.  On July 24, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of the Fox plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction as to the PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features.  On August 7, 2013, the Fox plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied on January 24, 2014.  The United States Supreme Court granted the Fox plaintiffs an extension until May 23, 2014 to file a petition for writ of certiorari, but they did not file one.  As a result, the stay of the NBC plaintiffs  action expired.  On August 6, 2014, at the request of the parties, the Central District of California granted a further stay of all proceedings in the action brought by the NBC plaintiffs, pending a final judgment on all claims in the Fox plaintiffs  action.    Pursuant to the settlement described below, the Fox action was dismissed on February 11, 2016.  On March 4, 2016, at the request of the parties, the Central District of California granted a further stay of all proceedings in the action brought by the NBC plaintiffs until September 9, 2016; provided that either party may file a motion with the Court to lift the stay after May 27, 2016.  Pursuant to a settlement between us and the NBC plaintiffs, on June 16, 2016, we and the NBC plaintiffs filed a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice all of our respective claims pending in the California Court.  The Court ordered such dismissal on June 20, 2016.

In addition, on February 21, 2013, the Fox plaintiffs filed a second motion for preliminary injunction against:  (i) us seeking to enjoin the Hopper Transfers feature in our second-generation Hopper set-top box, alleging breach of their retransmission consent agreement; and (ii) us and EchoStar Technologies L.L.C. seeking to enjoin the Slingbox placeshifting functionality in our second-generation Hopper set-top box, alleging copyright infringement and breach of their retransmission consent agreement.  On September 23, 2013, the California court denied the Fox plaintiffs  motion.  The Fox plaintiffs appealed, and on July 14, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of the Fox plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction as to the Hopper Transfers feature and the Slingbox placeshifting functionality in our second-generation Hopper set-top box. 

On January 12, 2015, the Court ruled on the Fox plaintiffs  and our respective motions for summary judgment, holding that:  (a) the Slingbox placeshifting functionality and the PrimeTime Anytime, AutoHop and Hopper Transfers features do not violate the copyright laws; (b) certain quality assurance copies (which were discontinued in November 2012) do violate the copyright laws; and (c) the Slingbox placeshifting functionality, the Hopper Transfers feature and such quality assurance copies breach our Fox retransmission consent agreement.  At the parties  joint request, the Court had stayed the case until January 15, 2016.  Pursuant to a settlement between us and the Fox plaintiffs, we, EchoStar Technologies L.L.C. and the Fox plaintiffs filed a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice all of our respective claims pending in the California Court.  The Court ordered such dismissal on February 11, 2016. 

New York Actions.    Both the ABC and CBS parties filed counterclaims in the New York action adding copyright claims against EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., and the CBS parties filed a counterclaim alleging that we fraudulently concealed the AutoHop feature when negotiating the renewal of our CBS retransmission consent agreement.  On November 23, 2012, the ABC plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Hopper set-top box s PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features.  On September 18, 2013, the New York court denied that motion.  The ABC plaintiffs appealed, and oral argument on the appeal was heard on February 20, 2014 before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Pursuant to a settlement between us and the ABC parties, during March 2014, the ABC parties withdrew their appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; we and the ABC parties filed a stipulation on March 4, 2014 to dismiss without prejudice all of our respective claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and the ABC parties granted a covenant not to sue.  The Court ordered such dismissal on March 6, 2014.  Pursuant to a settlement between us and the CBS parties, on December 10, 2014, we and the CBS parties filed a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice all of our respective claims pending in the New York Court.  The Court ordered such dismissal on December 10, 2014. 		 

These matters are now concluded. 

LightSquared/Harbinger Capital Partners LLC (LightSquared Bankruptcy) 

As previously disclosed in our public filings, L-Band Acquisition, LLC ( LBAC ), DISH Network s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Plan Support Agreement (the  PSA ) with certain senior secured lenders to LightSquared LP (the  LightSquared LP Lenders ) on July 23, 2013, which contemplated the purchase by LBAC of substantially all of the assets of LightSquared LP and certain of its subsidiaries (the  LBAC Bid ) that are debtors and debtors in possession in the LightSquared bankruptcy cases pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Bankruptcy Court ), which cases are jointly administered under the caption In re LightSquared Inc., et. al., Case No. 12 12080 (SCC). 

Pursuant to the PSA, LBAC was entitled to terminate the PSA in certain circumstances, certain of which required three business days  written notice, including, without limitation, in the event that certain milestones specified in the PSA were not met.  On January 7, 2014, LBAC delivered written notice of termination of the PSA to the LightSquared LP Lenders.  As a result, the PSA terminated effective on January 10, 2014, and the LBAC Bid was withdrawn.

On August 6, 2013, Harbinger Capital Partners LLC and other affiliates of Harbinger (collectively,  Harbinger ), a shareholder of LightSquared Inc., filed an adversary proceeding against DISH Network, LBAC, EchoStar, Charles W. Ergen (our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), SP Special Opportunities, LLC ( SPSO ) (an entity controlled by Mr. Ergen), and certain other parties, in the Bankruptcy Court.  Harbinger alleged, among other things, claims based on fraud, unfair competition, civil conspiracy and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage related to certain purchases of LightSquared secured debt by SPSO.  Subsequently, LightSquared intervened to join in certain claims alleged against certain defendants other than DISH Network, LBAC and EchoStar. 

On October 29, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed all of the claims in Harbinger s complaint in their entirety, but granted leave for LightSquared to file its own complaint in intervention.  On November 15, 2013, LightSquared filed its complaint, which included various claims against DISH Network, EchoStar, Mr. Ergen and SPSO.  On December 2, 2013, Harbinger filed an amended complaint, asserting various claims against SPSO.  On December 12, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed several of the claims asserted by LightSquared and Harbinger.  The surviving claims included, among others, LightSquared s claims against SPSO for declaratory relief, breach of contract and statutory disallowance; LightSquared s tortious interference claim against DISH Network, EchoStar and Mr. Ergen; and Harbinger s claim against SPSO for statutory disallowance.  These claims proceeded to a non-jury trial on January 9, 2014.  In its Post-Trial Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law entered on June 10, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court rejected all claims against DISH Network and EchoStar, and it rejected some but not all claims against the other defendants.  On July 7, 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Harbinger s motion for an interlocutory appeal of certain Bankruptcy Court orders in the adversary proceeding.  On March 27, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Modified Second Amended Joint Plan pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, on December 7, 2015, the Plan became effective. 		 

DISH Network intends to vigorously defend any claims against it in this proceeding and cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of this proceeding or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. 

LightSquared Transaction Shareholder Derivative Actions 

On August 9, 2013, a purported shareholder of DISH Network, Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund ( Jacksonville PFPF ), filed a putative shareholder derivative action in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty claims against the members of DISH Network s Board of Directors as of that date:  Charles W. Ergen; Joseph P. Clayton; James DeFranco; Cantey M. Ergen; Steven R. Goodbarn; David K. Moskowitz; Tom A. Ortolf; and Carl E. Vogel (collectively, the  Director Defendants ).  In its first amended complaint, Jacksonville PFPF asserted claims that Mr. Ergen breached his fiduciary duty to DISH Network in connection with certain purchases of LightSquared debt by SPSO, an entity controlled by Mr. Ergen, and that the other Director Defendants aided and abetted that alleged breach of duty.  The Jacksonville PFPF claims alleged that (1) the debt purchases created an impermissible conflict of interest and (2) put at risk the LBAC Bid, which as noted above was withdrawn.  Jacksonville PFPF further claimed that most members of DISH Network s Board of Directors are beholden to Mr. Ergen to an extent that prevents them from discharging their duties in connection with DISH Network s participation in the LightSquared bankruptcy auction process.  Jacksonville PFPF is seeking an unspecified amount of damages.  Jacksonville PFPF dismissed its claims against Mr. Goodbarn on October 8, 2013. 		 

Jacksonville PFPF sought a preliminary injunction that would enjoin Mr. Ergen and all of the Director Defendants other than Mr. Goodbarn from influencing DISH Network s efforts to acquire certain assets of LightSquared in the bankruptcy proceeding.  On November 27, 2013, the Court denied that request but granted narrower relief enjoining Mr. Ergen and anyone acting on his behalf from participating in negotiations related to one aspect of the LBAC Bid, which, as noted above, was withdrawn.

Five alleged shareholders filed substantially similar putative derivative complaints in state and federal courts alleging the same or substantially similar claims.  On September 18, 2013, DCM Multi-Manager Fund, LLC filed a duplicative putative derivative complaint in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada, which was consolidated with the Jacksonville PFPF action on October 9, 2013.  Between September 25, 2013 and October 2, 2013, City of Daytona Beach Police Officers and Firefighters Retirement System, Louisiana Municipal Police Employees  Retirement System and Iron Worker Mid-South Pension Fund filed duplicative putative derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  Also on October 2, 2013, Iron Workers District Council (Philadelphia and Vicinity) Retirement and Pension Plan filed its complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. 		 

On October 11, 2013, Iron Worker Mid-South Pension Fund dismissed its claims without prejudice.  On October 30, 2013, Louisiana Municipal Police Employees  Retirement System dismissed its claims without prejudice and, on January 2, 2014, filed a new complaint in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada, which, on May 2, 2014, was consolidated with the Jacksonville PFPF action.  On December 13, 2013, City of Daytona Beach Police Officers and Firefighters Retirement System voluntarily dismissed its claims without prejudice.  On March 28, 2014, Iron Workers District Council (Philadelphia and Vicinity) Retirement and Pension Plan voluntarily dismissed its claims without prejudice. 

On July 25, 2014, Jacksonville PFPF filed a second amended complaint, which added claims against George R. Brokaw and Charles M. Lillis, as Director Defendants, and Thomas A. Cullen, R. Stanton Dodge and K. Jason Kiser, as officers of DISH Network. Jacksonville PFPF asserted five claims in its second amended complaint, each of which alleged breaches of the duty of loyalty.  Three of the claims were asserted solely against Mr. Ergen; one claim was made against all of the remaining Director Defendants, other than Mr. Ergen and Mr. Clayton; and the final claim was made against Messrs. Cullen, Dodge and Kiser. 

DISH Network s Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee to review the factual allegations and legal claims in these actions.  On October 24, 2014, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada regarding its investigation of the claims and allegations asserted in Jacksonville PFPF s second amended complaint.  The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to dismiss the action based, among other things, on its business judgment that it is in the best interests of DISH Network not to pursue the claims asserted by Jacksonville PFPF.  The Director Defendants and Messrs. Cullen, Dodge and Kiser have also filed various motions to dismiss the action.  In an order entered on September 18, 2015, the Court granted the Special Litigation Committee s motion to defer to the Special Litigation Committee s October 24, 2014 report, including its finding that dismissal of the action is in the best interest of DISH Network.  The Court also held that, in light of granting the motion to defer, the pending motions to dismiss filed by the individual defendants were denied without prejudice as moot.  On October 12, 2015, Jacksonville PFPF filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nevada, and the appeal is now fully briefed.  DISH Network cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of these suits or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Qurio Holdings, Inc. 

On September 26, 2014, Qurio Holdings, Inc. ( Qurio ) filed a complaint against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,102,863 (the  863 patent ) entitled  Highspeed WAN To Wireless LAN Gateway  and United States Patent No. 7,787,904 (the  904 patent ) entitled  Personal Area Network Having Media Player And Mobile Device Controlling The Same.   On the same day, Qurio filed similar complaints against Comcast and DirecTV.  On November 13, 2014, Qurio filed a first amended complaint, which added a claim alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,879,567 (the  567 patent ) entitled  High-Speed WAN To Wireless LAN Gateway.

Vermont National Telephone Company 

On September 23, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed a qui tam complaint that was filed by Vermont National Telephone Company ( Vermont National ) against DISH Network; DISH Network s wholly-owned subsidiaries, American AWS-3 Wireless I L.L.C., American II, American III, and DISH Wireless Holding L.L.C.; Charles W. Ergen (our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and Cantey M. Ergen (a member of our board of directors); Northstar Wireless; Northstar Spectrum; Northstar Manager, LLC; SNR Wireless; SNR HoldCo; SNR Wireless Management, LLC; and certain other parties.  The complaint was unsealed after the United States Department of Justice notified the Court that it had declined to intervene in the action.  The complaint is a civil action that was filed under seal on May 13, 2015 by Vermont National, which participated in the AWS-3 Auction through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VTel Wireless.  The complaint alleges violations of the federal civil False Claims Act (the  FCA ) based on, among other things, allegations that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless falsely claimed bidding credits of 25% in the AWS-3 Auction when they were allegedly under the de facto control of DISH Wireless Holding L.L.C. and, therefore, were not entitled to the bidding credits as designated entities under applicable FCC rules.  Vermont National seeks to recover on behalf of the United States government approximately $10 billion, which reflects the $3.3 billion in bidding credits that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless claimed in the AWS-3 Auction, trebled under the FCA.  Vermont National also seeks civil penalties of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 for each violation of the FCA.     		 

DISH Network intend to vigorously defend this case.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of this proceeding or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages. 

Waste Disposal Inquiry 

The California Attorney General and the Alameda County (California) District Attorney are investigating whether certain of our waste disposal policies, procedures and practices are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code and the California Health and Safety Code.  We expect that these entities will seek injunctive and monetary relief.  The investigation appears to be part of a broader effort to investigate waste handling and disposal processes of a number of industries.  While we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation, we do not believe that the outcome will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Other 

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees.  In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 

9.  Financial Information for Subsidiary Guarantors 

Our senior notes are fully, unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries other than minor subsidiaries, and the stand-alone entity DISH DBS has no independent assets or operations.  Therefore, supplemental financial information on a condensed consolidating basis of the guarantor subsidiaries is not required.

We generally have the option to renew the lease on a year-to-year basis through the end of the satellite s life.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew this agreement will be exercised.     

EchoStar XVI.    During December 2009, we entered into a transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease all of the capacity on EchoStar XVI, a DBS satellite, after its service commencement date.  EchoStar XVI was launched during November 2012 to replace EchoStar XV at the 61.5 degree orbital location and is currently in service.

During July 2016, we and EchoStar amended the transponder service agreement to, among other things, extend the initial term by one additional year and to reduce the term of the first renewal option by one year.  Prior to expiration of the initial term, we have the option to renew for an additional five-year period.  Prior to expiration of the initial term, EchoStar also has the right, upon certain conditions, to renew for an additional five-year period.  If either we or EchoStar exercise our respective five-year renewal options, then we have the option to renew for an additional five-year period prior to expiration of the then-current term.

DISH Network has also guaranteed certain obligations of EchoStar under the Telesat Transponder Agreement.  See discussion under  Guarantees  in Note 8. 

Under the terms of the DISH Nimiq 5 Agreement, we make certain monthly payments to EchoStar that commenced in September 2009 when the Nimiq 5 satellite was placed into service and continue through the service term.  Unless earlier terminated under the terms and conditions of the DISH Nimiq 5 Agreement, the service term will expire ten years following the date the Nimiq 5 satellite was placed into service.  Upon expiration of the initial term, we have the option to renew the DISH Nimiq 5 Agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end-of-life of the Nimiq 5 satellite.  Upon in orbit failure or end-of-life of the Nimiq 5 satellite, and in certain other circumstances, we have certain rights to receive service from EchoStar on a replacement satellite.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew the DISH Nimiq 5 Agreement will be exercised or that we will exercise our option to receive service on a replacement satellite. 		 

QuetzSat-1 Lease Agreement.      During 2008, EchoStar entered into a ten-year satellite service agreement with SES Latin America S.A. ( SES ), which provides, among other things, for the provision by SES to EchoStar of service on 32 DBS transponders on the QuetzSat-1 satellite.  During 2008, EchoStar also entered into a transponder service agreement ( QuetzSat-1 Transponder Agreement ) with us pursuant to which we receive service from EchoStar on 24 DBS transponders.  QuetzSat-1 was launched on September 29, 2011 and was placed into service during the fourth quarter 2011 at the 67.1 degree orbital location while we and EchoStar explored alternative uses for the QuetzSat-1 satellite.  In the interim, EchoStar provided us with alternate capacity at the 77 degree orbital location.  During the first quarter 2013, we and EchoStar entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sublease five DBS transponders back to EchoStar.  During January 2013, QuetzSat-1 was moved to the 77 degree orbital location and we commenced commercial operations at that location in February 2013. 		 

Unless earlier terminated under the terms and conditions of the QuetzSat-1 Transponder Agreement, the initial service term will expire in November 2021.  Upon expiration of the initial term, we have the option to renew the QuetzSat-1 Transponder Agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end-of-life of the QuetzSat-1 satellite.  Upon an in-orbit failure or end-of-life of the QuetzSat-1 satellite, and in certain other circumstances, we have certain rights to receive service from EchoStar on a replacement satellite.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew the QuetzSat-1 Transponder Agreement will be exercised or that we will exercise our option to receive service on a replacement satellite. 

103 Degree Orbital Location/SES-3.    During May 2012, EchoStar entered into a spectrum development agreement (the  103 Spectrum Development Agreement ) with Ciel Satellite Holdings Inc. ( Ciel ) to develop certain spectrum rights at the 103 degree orbital location (the  103 Spectrum Rights ).  During June 2013, we and EchoStar entered into a spectrum development agreement (the  DISH 103 Spectrum Development Agreement ) pursuant to which we may use and develop the 103 Spectrum Rights.  Unless earlier terminated under the terms and conditions of the DISH 103 Spectrum Development Agreement, the term generally will continue for the duration of the 103 Spectrum Rights. 

In connection with the 103 Spectrum Development Agreement, during May 2012, EchoStar also entered into a ten-year service agreement with Ciel pursuant to which EchoStar leases certain satellite capacity from Ciel on the SES-3 satellite at the 103 degree orbital location (the  103 Service Agreement ).  During June 2013, we and EchoStar entered into an agreement pursuant to which we lease certain satellite capacity from EchoStar on the SES-3 satellite (the  DISH 103 Service Agreement ).  Under the terms of the DISH 103 Service Agreement, we make certain monthly payments to EchoStar through the service term.  Unless earlier terminated under the terms and conditions of the DISH 103 Service Agreement, the initial service term will expire on the earlier of:  (i) the date the SES-3 satellite fails; (ii) the date the transponder(s) on which service was being provided under the agreement fails; or (iii) ten years following the actual service commencement date.  Upon in-orbit failure or end-of-life of the SES-3 satellite, and in certain other circumstances, we have certain rights to receive service from EchoStar on a replacement satellite.  There can be no assurance that we will exercise our option to receive service on a replacement satellite.

TT C Agreement.    Effective January 1, 2012, we entered into a telemetry, tracking and control ( TT C ) agreement pursuant to which we receive TT C services from EchoStar for certain satellites for a period ending on December 31, 2016 (the  2012 TT C Agreement ).  In November 2016, we and EchoStar amended the 2012 TT C Agreement to extend the term thereof for one additional year until December 31, 2017.        The fees for services provided under the 2012 TT C Agreement are calculated at either:  (i) a fixed fee; or (ii) cost plus a fixed margin, which will vary depending on the nature of the services provided.  We are able to terminate the 2012 TT C Agreement for any reason upon 60 days notice. 		 

DISHOnline.com Services Agreement.    Effective January 1, 2010, we entered into a two-year agreement with EchoStar pursuant to which we receive certain services associated with an online video portal.  The fees for the services provided under this services agreement depend, among other things, upon the cost to develop and operate such services.  We have the option to renew this agreement for successive one year terms and the agreement may be terminated for any reason upon at least 120 days notice to EchoStar.  In     November 2015, we exercised our right to renew this agreement for a one-year period ending on December 31, 2016. 

Sling TV Holding.    On May 2, 2014, DISH Network contributed its equity interest in Sling TV Holding to us.  Effective July 1, 2012, DISH Network and EchoStar formed Sling TV Holding, which was owned two-thirds by DISH Network and one-third by EchoStar and was consolidated into DISH Network s financial statements beginning July 1, 2012.  Sling TV Holding was formed to develop and commercialize certain advanced technologies.  At that time, DISH Network, EchoStar and Sling TV Holding entered into the following agreements with respect to Sling TV Holding:  (i) a contribution agreement pursuant to which DISH Network and EchoStar contributed certain assets in exchange for its respective ownership interests in Sling TV Holding; (ii) a limited liability company operating agreement (the  Operating Agreement ), which provides for the governance of Sling TV Holding; and (iii) a commercial agreement (the  Commercial Agreement ) pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV Holding has:  (a) certain rights and corresponding obligations with respect to its business; and (b) the right, but not the obligation, to receive certain services from DISH Network and EchoStar, respectively.  Since this was a formation of an entity under common control and a step-up in basis was not allowed, each party s contributions were recorded at historical book value for accounting purposes. 		 

Effective August 1, 2014, EchoStar and Sling TV Holding entered into the Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV Holding distributed certain assets to EchoStar and EchoStar reduced its interest in Sling TV Holding to a ten percent non-voting interest.  We now have a ninety percent equity interest and a 100% voting interest in Sling TV Holding.  In addition, we, EchoStar and Sling TV Holding amended and restated the Operating Agreement, primarily to reflect the changes implemented by the Exchange Agreement.  Finally, we, EchoStar and Sling TV Holding amended and restated the Commercial Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV Holding:  (1) continues to have certain rights and corresponding obligations with respect to its business; (2) continues to have the right, but not the obligation, to receive certain services from us and EchoStar; and (3) has a license from EchoStar to use certain of the assets distributed to EchoStar as part of the Exchange Agreement. Sling TV Holding operates, through its subsidiary Sling TV L.L.C., the Sling TV services. 		 

Since the Exchange Agreement is among entities under common control, we recorded the difference between the historical cost basis of the assets transferred to EchoStar and our historical cost basis in EchoStar s one-third noncontrolling interest in Sling TV Holding as a $6 million, net of deferred taxes, capital distribution in  Additional paid-in capital  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  In addition, we recorded the initial fair value of EchoStar s ten percent non-voting interest as a $14 million, net of deferred taxes, deemed distribution in  Additional paid-in capital  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

EchoStar s ten percent non-voting interest is redeemable contingent on a certain performance goal being achieved by Sling TV Holding.  In addition, subject to certain conditions, the interest is redeemable at fair value within sixty days following the fifth anniversary of the Exchange Agreement.  This interest is considered temporary equity and is recorded as  Redeemable noncontrolling interests  in the mezzanine section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  EchoStar s redeemable noncontrolling interest in Sling TV Holding was initially accounted for at fair value.  The performance goal has been determined to be probable of achievement.  Accordingly, the value of EchoStar s redeemable noncontrolling interest in Sling TV Holding is adjusted each reporting period for any change in redemption value above the initial fair value (adjusted for the operating results of Sling TV Holding attributable to EchoStar subsequent to August 1, 2014), with the offset recorded in  Additional paid-in capital,  net of deferred taxes, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Subsequent to the Exchange Agreement, the operating results of Sling TV Holding attributable to EchoStar are recorded as  Redeemable noncontrolling interests  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the offset recorded in  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax  on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 		 

General and administrative expenses  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $25 million and $27 million, respectively, for general and administrative expenses from EchoStar.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $72 million and $70 million, respectively, for general and administrative expenses from EchoStar.  These amounts are recorded in  General and administrative expenses  on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The agreements pertaining to these expenses are discussed below. 

Product Support Agreement.    In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a product support agreement pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to receive product support from EchoStar (including certain engineering and technical support services) for all set-top boxes and related accessories that EchoStar has previously sold and in the future may sell to us.  The fees for the services provided under the product support agreement are calculated at cost plus a fixed margin, which varies depending on the nature of the services provided.  The term of the product support agreement is the economic life of such receivers and related accessories, unless terminated earlier.  We may terminate the product support agreement for any reason upon at least 60 days notice.  In the event of an early termination of this agreement, we are entitled to a refund of any unearned fees paid to EchoStar for the services. 		 

Real Estate Lease Agreements.    We have entered into lease agreements pursuant to which we lease certain real estate from EchoStar.  The rent on a per square foot basis for each of the leases is comparable to per square foot rental rates of similar commercial property in the same geographic area, and EchoStar is responsible for its portion of the taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance of the premises.  The term of each lease is set forth below:

We and EchoStar each have the right to terminate the XiP Encryption Agreement for any reason upon at least 30 days notice and 180 days notice, respectively.  The fees for the services provided under the XiP Encryption Agreement are calculated on a monthly basis based on the number of receivers utilizing such security measures each month. 		 

Sling Trademark License Agreement.    On December 31, 2014, Sling TV L.L.C. entered into an agreement with Sling Media, Inc., a subsidiary of EchoStar, pursuant to which we have the right for a fixed fee to use certain trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property related to the  Sling  trademark for a period ending on December 31, 2016. 

Professional Services Agreement  .  Prior to 2010, in connection with the Spin-off, DISH Network entered into various agreements with EchoStar including the Transition Services Agreement, Satellite Procurement Agreement and Services Agreement, which all expired on January 1, 2010 and were replaced by a Professional Services Agreement.  During 2009, DISH Network and EchoStar agreed that EchoStar shall continue to have the right, but not the obligation, to receive the following services from DISH Network, among others, certain of which were previously provided under the Transition Services Agreement: information technology, travel and event coordination, internal audit, legal, accounting and tax, benefits administration, program acquisition services and other support services.  Mr. Vivek Khemka, DISH Network s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, currently also provides services pursuant to the Professional Services Agreement to EchoStar as the President of EchoStar Technologies L.L.C.        Additionally, DISH Network and EchoStar agreed that DISH Network shall continue to have the right, but not the obligation, to engage EchoStar to manage the process of procuring new satellite capacity for DISH Network (previously provided under the Satellite Procurement Agreement) and receive logistics, procurement and quality assurance services from EchoStar (previously provided under the Services Agreement) and other support services.  The Professional Services Agreement will renew on January 1, 2017 for an additional one-year period until January 1, 2018 and renews automatically for successive one-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier by either party upon at least 60 days notice.  However, either party may terminate the Professional Services Agreement in part with respect to any particular service it receives for any reason upon at least 30 days notice.  Revenue for services provided by us to EchoStar under the Professional Services Agreement is recorded in  Equipment sales and other revenue  on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Other Agreements - EchoStar 

Receiver Agreement.    EchoStar is currently our primary supplier of set-top box receivers.  Effective January 1, 2012, we and EchoStar entered into a receiver agreement (the  2012 Receiver Agreement ) pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase digital set-top boxes, related accessories, and other equipment.   In November 2016, we and EchoStar amended the 2012 Receiver Agreement to extend the term thereof for one additional year until December 31, 2017.  The 2012 Receiver Agreement allows us to purchase digital set-top boxes, related accessories and other equipment from EchoStar either:  (i) at a cost (decreasing as EchoStar reduces costs and increasing as costs increase) plus a dollar mark-up which will depend upon the cost of the product subject to a collar on EchoStar s mark-up; or (ii) at cost plus a fixed margin, which will depend on the nature of the equipment purchased.  Under the 2012 Receiver Agreement, EchoStar s margins will be increased if they are able to reduce the costs of their digital set-top boxes and their margins will be reduced if these costs increase.  EchoStar provides us with standard manufacturer warranties for the goods sold under the 2012 Receiver Agreement.  Additionally, the 2012 Receiver Agreement includes an indemnification provision, whereby the parties indemnify each other for certain intellectual property matters.  We are able to terminate the 2012 Receiver Agreement for any reason upon at least 60 days notice to EchoStar.  EchoStar is able to terminate the 2012 Receiver Agreement if certain entities acquire us. 		 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we purchased set-top boxes and other equipment from EchoStar of $154 million and $154 million, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we purchased set-top boxes and other equipment from EchoStar of $584 million and $570 million, respectively.  Included in these amounts are purchases of certain broadband equipment from EchoStar under the 2012 Receiver Agreement.  These amounts are initially included in  Inventory  and are subsequently capitalized as  Property and equipment, net  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets or expensed as  Subscriber acquisition costs  or  Subscriber-related expenses  on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when the equipment is deployed. 

Tax Sharing Agreement.    In connection with the Spin-off, DISH Network entered into a tax sharing agreement with EchoStar which governs our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Spin-off with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before the Spin-off.  Generally, all pre-Spin-off taxes, including any taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to implement the Spin-off, are borne by DISH Network, and DISH Network will indemnify EchoStar for such taxes.  However, DISH Network is not liable for and will not indemnify EchoStar for any taxes that are incurred as a result of the Spin-off or certain related transactions failing to qualify as tax-free distributions pursuant to any provision of Section 355 or Section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) because of:  (i) a direct or indirect acquisition of any of EchoStar s stock, stock options or assets; (ii) any action that EchoStar takes or fails to take; or (iii) any action that EchoStar takes that is inconsistent with the information and representations furnished to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) in connection with the request for the private letter ruling, or to counsel in connection with any opinion being delivered by counsel with respect to the Spin-off or certain related transactions.  In such case, EchoStar is solely liable for, and will indemnify DISH Network for, any resulting taxes, as well as any losses, claims and expenses.  The tax sharing agreement will only terminate after the later of the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations, including extensions, or once all rights and obligations are fully effectuated or performed.

TiVo.    On April 29, 2011, DISH Network and EchoStar entered into a settlement agreement with TiVo Inc. ( TiVo ).  The settlement resolved all pending litigation between DISH Network and EchoStar, on the one hand, and TiVo, on the other hand, including litigation relating to alleged patent infringement involving certain DISH digital video recorders, or DVRs.  Under the settlement agreement, all pending litigation was dismissed with prejudice and all injunctions that permanently restrain, enjoin or compel any action by DISH Network or EchoStar were dissolved.  DISH Network and EchoStar are jointly responsible for making payments to TiVo in the aggregate amount of $500 million, including an initial payment of $300 million and the remaining $200 million in six equal annual installments between 2012 and 2017.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off of EchoStar from DISH Network, DISH Network made the initial payment to TiVo in May 2011, except for the contribution from EchoStar totaling approximately $10 million, representing an allocation of liability relating to EchoStar s sales of DVR-enabled receivers to an international customer.  Future payments will be allocated between DISH Network and EchoStar based on historical sales of certain licensed products, with DISH Network being responsible for 95% of each annual payment. 		 

Patent Cross-License Agreements  .  During December 2011, DISH Network and EchoStar entered into separate patent cross-license agreements with the same third party whereby:  (i) EchoStar and such third party licensed their respective patents to each other subject to certain conditions; and (ii) DISH Network and such third-party licensed their respective patents to each other subject to certain conditions (each, a  Cross-License Agreement ).  Each Cross License Agreement covers patents acquired by the respective party prior to January 1, 2017 and aggregate payments under both Cross-License Agreements total less than $10 million.  Each Cross License Agreement also contains an option to extend each Cross-License Agreement to include patents acquired by the respective party prior to January 1, 2022.  If both options are exercised, the aggregate additional payments to such third-party would total less than $3 million.  However, DISH Network and EchoStar may elect to extend their respective Cross-License Agreement independently of each other.  Since the aggregate payments under both Cross-License Agreements were based on the combined annual revenues of DISH Network and EchoStar, DISH Network and EchoStar agreed to allocate their respective payments to such third party based on their respective percentage of combined total revenue. 		 

Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction with EchoStar.    On February 20, 2014, we entered into the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction with EchoStar pursuant to which, among other things: (i) on March 1, 2014, we transferred to EchoStar and HSSC the Transferred Satellites, including related in-orbit incentive obligations and cash interest payments of approximately $59 million and approximately $11 million in cash in exchange for the Tracking Stock; and (ii) beginning on March 1, 2014, we lease back all available satellite capacity on the Transferred Satellites.  The Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction is further described below: 

Transaction Agreement.    On February 20, 2014, DOLLC, DNLLC and EchoStar XI Holding L.L.C., all indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of us, entered into the Transaction Agreement with EchoStar, HSSC and Alpha Company LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar, pursuant to which, on March 1, 2014, we, among other things, transferred to EchoStar and HSSC the Transferred Satellites in exchange for the Tracking Stock.  The Tracking Stock generally tracks the Hughes Retail Group.  The shares of the Tracking Stock issued to us represent an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group.  Since the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction is among entities under common control, we recorded the Tracking Stock at EchoStar s and HSSC s historical cost basis for these instruments of $229 million and $87 million, respectively.  The difference between the historical cost basis of the Tracking Stock received and the net carrying value of the Transferred Satellites of $356 million (including debt obligations, net of deferred taxes), plus the $11 million in cash, resulted in a $51 million capital transaction recorded in  Additional paid-in capital  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Although our investment in the Tracking Stock represents an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, we have no operational control or significant influence over the Hughes Retail Group business, and currently there is no public market for the Tracking Stock.  As such, the Tracking Stock is accounted for under the cost method of accounting.  The Transaction Agreement includes, among other things, customary mutual provisions for representations, warranties and indemnification.

Investor Rights Agreement.    On February 20, 2014, EchoStar, HSSC, DOLLC and DNLLC (DOLLC and DNLLC, collectively referred to as the  DISH Investors ) also entered into the Investor Rights Agreement with respect to the Tracking Stock.  The Investor Rights Agreement provides, among other things, certain information and consultation rights for the DISH Investors; certain transfer restrictions on the Tracking Stock and certain rights and obligations to offer and sell under certain circumstances (including a prohibition on transfers of the Tracking Stock for one year, with continuing transfer restrictions (including a right of first offer in favor of EchoStar) thereafter, an obligation to sell the Tracking Stock to EchoStar in connection with a change of control of DISH Network and a right to require EchoStar to repurchase the Tracking Stock in connection with a change of control of EchoStar, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions); certain registration rights; certain obligations to provide conversion and exchange rights of the Tracking Stock under certain circumstances; and certain protective covenants afforded to holders of the Tracking Stock.  The Investor Rights Agreement generally will terminate as to the DISH Investors at such time as the DISH Investors no longer hold any shares of the HSSC-issued Tracking Stock and any registrable securities under the Investor Rights Agreement.     

PMC.    During 2008, Personalized Media Communications, Inc. ( PMC ) filed suit against DISH Network; EchoStar and Motorola Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,109,414; 4,965,825; 5,233,654; 5,335,277 and 5,887,243, which relate to satellite signal processing.  On May 7, 2015, DISH Network, EchoStar and PMC entered into a settlement and release agreement that provided, among other things, for a license by PMC to DISH Network and EchoStar for certain patents and patent applications and the dismissal of all of PMC s claims in the action against DISH Network and EchoStar with prejudice.  On June 4, 2015, the Court dismissed all of PMC s claims in the action against DISH Network and EchoStar with prejudice.  In June 2015, DISH Network and EchoStar agreed that EchoStar would contribute a one-time payment of $5 million towards the settlement under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off and the 2012 Receiver Agreement. 		 

gTLD Bidding Agreement.    In April 2015, we and EchoStar entered into a gTLD Bidding Agreement whereby, among other things:  (i) we obtained rights from EchoStar to participate in a generic top level domain ( gTLD ) auction, assuming all rights and obligations from EchoStar related to EchoStar s application with ICANN for a particular gTLD; (ii) we agreed to reimburse EchoStar for its ICANN application fee and certain out-of-pocket expenses related to the application and the auction; and (iii) we and EchoStar agreed to split equally the net proceeds obtained by us as the losing bidder in the auction, less such fee reimbursement and out-of-pocket expenses.  During the third quarter 2015, we paid EchoStar approximately $1 million related to this agreement. 

Rovi License Agreement.    On August 19, 2016, we entered into a ten-year patent license agreement (the  Rovi License Agreement ) with Rovi Corporation ( Rovi ) and, for certain limited purposes, EchoStar.  EchoStar is a party to the Rovi License Agreement solely with respect to certain provisions relating to the prior patent license agreement between EchoStar and Rovi.  There are no payments between us and EchoStar under the Rovi License Agreement. 

Sale of Orange, New Jersey Properties.      In October 2016, we and EchoStar sold two parcels of real estate owned separately by us and EchoStar in Orange, New Jersey to a third party pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, we and EchoStar separately received our respective payments from the buyer.

Overview 

Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value.  We promote DISH      branded programming packages as providing our subscribers with a better  price-to-value  relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. 

As the pay-TV industry is mature, our strategy has included an increased emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers, even if it means that we will acquire and retain fewer overall subscribers.  We evaluate the quality of subscribers based upon a number of factors, including, among others, profitability.  Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, this strategy.  There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline. 

Our current revenue and profit is primarily derived from providing Pay-TV services to our subscribers.  We also generate revenue from equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with receivers with multiple tuners; advertising services; and fees earned from our in-home service operations.  Our most significant expenses are subscriber-related expenses, which are primarily related to programming, subscriber acquisition costs and depreciation and amortization.

We offer pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the Sling      brand (collectively  Pay-TV  services).  We had 13.643 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States as of September 30, 2016 and are the nation s fourth largest pay-TV provider  .    Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured.  To differentiate our DISH branded pay-TV service from our competitors, we introduced the Hopper      whole-home DVR during 2012 and have continued to add functionality and simplicity for a more intuitive user experience.  Our Hopper and Joey      whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere.  It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers.  During the first quarter 2016, we made our next generation Hopper, the Hopper 3, available to customers nationwide.  Among other things, the Hopper 3 features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously.  There can be no assurance that these integrated features and functionality will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. 		 

Sling branded pay-TV services.      The Sling branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, live, linear streaming over-the-top ( OTT ) Internet-based domestic, international and Latino video programming services ( Sling TV ).        We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services.  Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on certain streaming-capable devices including TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and smart phones.  The Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld) was launched prior to 2015, which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers.  Sling International offers over 200 channels in 18 languages.  In February 2015, we launched our Sling domestic service.  The Sling domestic core package consists of over 20 channels offered for a monthly subscription.  In addition to the core programming package, Sling domestic offers additional tiers of programming, including sports, kids, movies, world news, lifestyle and Spanish language and additional premium content such as HBO, each available for an additional monthly fee.  Sling TV programming is offered live and on-demand and can be replayed as programming rights permit.  In June 2015, we also launched our Sling Latino service.  In addition to these Sling TV services that may only be streamed on one device at a time (single-stream services), on April 13, 2016, we launched a live beta multi-stream Sling domestic service, which includes, among other things, the ability to stream on up to three devices simultaneously.        During June 2016, our multi-stream Sling domestic service transitioned from its introductory beta period and was re-branded as Sling Blue.  Meanwhile, we re-branded our single-stream Sling domestic service as Sling Orange.  All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count.  		 

Trends 

Competition 

Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured.  With respect to our DISH branded pay TV services, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services.  Some of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers.  In some cases, certain competitors have been able to potentially subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services.  We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH branded pay-TV customers, mostly as a result of upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits.  Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.  Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from content providers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet.  Programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices.  Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose.  Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our services ( cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages ( cord shaving ) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us.

Item 2.      MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Continued 

We implement new marketing promotions from time to time that are intended to increase our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.  During 2015 and early 2016, we launched various marketing promotions offering certain DISH branded pay-TV programming packages without a price increase for a limited time period.  During the third quarter 2016, we launched our Flex Pack skinny bundle with a core package of programming consisting of more than 50 channels and the choice of one of eight themed add-on channel packs, which include local broadcast networks and kids, national and regional sports and general entertainment programming.  In addition, subscribers can add or remove channel packs to best suit their entertainment needs.    While we plan to implement other new marketing efforts, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.  Additionally, in response to our efforts, we may face increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. 		 

In addition, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate continue to be negatively impacted by stricter customer acquisition and retention policies for our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers, as well as increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. 

Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above.  There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline.  In the event that our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 

Programming 

Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.  Programming costs represent a large percentage of our  Subscriber-related expenses  and the largest component of our total expense.  We expect these costs to continue to increase, and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, especially for local broadcast channels.  The rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers.  In addition, programming costs continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.  Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers. 		 

Increases in programming costs generally cause us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service.  Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay-per-view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. 

Furthermore, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts before they expire.  In the past, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers, including, among others, Tribune Broadcasting Company ( Tribune ) during the second and third quarters of 2016.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future.  As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses, and higher Pay-TV churn rates.

Item 2.      MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Continued 

Operations and Customer Service 

While competitive factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to us.  In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by our operational inefficiencies.  To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called  smart cards,  or security chips in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content ( Security Access Devices ).  We expect that future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure.  To combat other forms of fraud, among other things, we monitor our independent distributors  and independent retailers  adherence to our business rules. 

While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial condition and results of operations.  To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations.  These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run.  We cannot be certain, however, that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance. 

Changes in our Technology 

We have been deploying DBS receivers that utilize 8PSK modulation technology with MPEG-4 compression technology for several years.  These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow improved broadcast efficiency, and therefore allow increased programming capacity.  Many of our customers today, however, do not have DBS receivers that use MPEG-4 compression technology.  In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs.  All new DBS receivers that we purchase from EchoStar Corporation ( EchoStar ) have MPEG-4 compression with 8PSK modulation technology. 

In addition, from time to time, we change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives.  We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes. 

Operational Liquidity 

We make general investments in property such as satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our overall business.  Moreover, since we are a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers.  While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary.  Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment.  Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurances that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment. 

There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time.  The first factor is our Pay-TV churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current Pay-TV subscribers.  As we lose Pay-TV subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced.  The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins.  To the extent our  Subscriber-related expenses  grow faster than our  Subscriber-related revenue,  the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced.  The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers.  The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers.  Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we make general investments and any cash flow from financing activities.

Item 2.      MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Continued 

Our subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow.  While fewer subscribers will likely translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long-term, cash flow is actually aided, in the short-term, by the reduction in subscriber-specific investment spending.  As a result, a slow-down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short-term liquidity risk as it might in other industries. 

Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity 

The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty.  While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Future Liquidity 

Debt Maturity 

Our 7 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.5 billion were redeemed on February 1, 2016. 

Our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million mature on July 15, 2017.  We expect to fund this obligation from cash generated from operations, existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and/or cash proceeds from any debt financings. 

Wireless Spectrum 

DISH Network Spectrum.    DISH Network has invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets.  DISH Network will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly.  DISH Network may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize its wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers.   

Auction 1000.    On February 10, 2016, DISH Network filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to potentially participate as a bidder in the forward auction phase of the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction in the 600 MHz frequency range ( Auction 1000 ).  The available spectrum in each licensed geographic area in Auction 1000 is generally comprised of certain paired 5x5 spectrum blocks (5 MHz uplink spectrum and 5 MHz downlink spectrum).  As a result, a nationwide footprint may be obtained by aggregating a single 5x5 spectrum block in each available licensed geographic area.  

Auction 1000 has had multiple stages, with each stage having two phases.  With respect to each stage, in the first phase, or reverse auction phase, participating television broadcasters  sell  their rights to use certain broadcast television spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range to the FCC.  Then following the first phase of a stage, in the second phase, or forward auction phase, the FCC will  resell  that spectrum to auction participants.  In the event that certain criteria are not met within a particular stage for Auction 1000 to conclude, Auction 1000 then proceeds to a subsequent stage with less available spectrum than the immediately preceding stage and lower spectrum clearing targets. 

Before the forward auction phase of Stage 1 of Auction 1000 began, a qualified bidder in the forward auction phase could make an upfront deposit of up to approximately $5.4 billion.  On July 15, 2016, the FCC announced that a subsidiary of DISH Network and 61 other applicants were qualified to participate in the forward auction phase of Auction 1000.  The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be  anonymous,  which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant s upfront deposits or its bids.  In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000.

Stage 1:    The reverse auction phase of Stage 1 began on March 29, 2016 and concluded on June 29, 2016.  Pursuant to the FCC s procedures for Auction 1000 and based on the results of the reverse auction phase of Stage 1, in order for Auction 1000 to have concluded, the aggregate bids in the forward auction phase of Stage 1  would have had to have exceeded approximately $88.4 billion.  The forward auction phase of Stage 1 included 100 MHz of spectrum in over 90% of the available licensed geographic areas, based on the broadcasters  indicated availability of spectrum in the reverse auction phase.  The forward auction phase of Stage 1 commenced on August 16, 2016 and concluded on August 30, 2016, but the aggregate bids of approximately $23.1 billion did not exceed the approximately $88.4 billion required for Auction 1000 to conclude.  As a result, Auction 1000 moved to Stage 2.     

Stage 2:    The reverse auction phase of Stage 2 began on September 13, 2016 and concluded on October 13, 2016.  Pursuant to the FCC s procedures for Auction 1000 and based on the results of the reverse auction phase of Stage 2, in order for Auction 1000 to have concluded, the aggregate bids in the forward auction phase of Stage 2 would have had to have exceeded approximately $56.5 billion.  The forward auction phase of Stage 2 included 90 MHz of spectrum in over 90% of the available licensed geographic areas, based on the broadcasters  indicated availability of spectrum in the reverse auction phase.  The forward auction phase of Stage 2 commenced and concluded on October 19, 2016, but the aggregate bids of approximately $21.5 billion did not exceed the approximately $56.5 billion required for Auction 1000 to conclude.  As a result, Auction 1000 moved to Stage 3.       

In connection with the development of DISH Network s wireless business, including without limitation the efforts described above, we have made cash distributions to partially finance these efforts to date and may make additional cash distributions to finance in whole or in part DISH Network s future efforts.  See Note 10 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our dividends to DISH Orbital Corporation ( DOC ).  There can be no assurance that DISH Network will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that DISH Network will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses. 

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses.    Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. ( American II ) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. ( American III ), DISH Network has made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, LLC ( Northstar Spectrum ), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, LLC ( Northstar Wireless,  and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the  Northstar Entities ), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC ( SNR HoldCo ), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC ( SNR Wireless,  and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the  SNR Entities ), respectively.  On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the  AWS-3 Licenses ) to Northstar Wireless (the  Northstar Licenses ) and to SNR Wireless (the  SNR Licenses ), respectively.  DISH Network may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses.  Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. 		 

In connection with certain funding obligations related to the investments by American II and American III discussed above, in February 2015, we paid a dividend of $8.250 billion to DOC for, among other things, general corporate purposes, which included such funding obligations, and to fund other DISH Network cash needs.  We may make additional cash distributions to finance in whole or in part loans that DISH Network may make to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities in the future related to DISH Network s non-controlling investments in these entities.  There can be no assurance that DISH Network will be able to obtain a profitable return on its non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.

We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, make additional cash distributions to DISH Network, continue investing in our business and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. 

See Note 10    Commitments and Contingencies   Commitments    in the Notes to     DISH Network s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 for further information. 

Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Senior Notes 

The indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on our ability to:  (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets.  Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes could become immediately payable.  The senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur.  As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were in compliance with the covenants. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ).  This converged standard on revenue recognition was issued jointly with the International Accounting Standards Board to create common revenue recognition guidance for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and International Financial Reporting Standards.  ASU 2014-09 provides a framework for revenue recognition that replaces most existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective.  ASU 2014-09 allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.  We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  We have not yet selected an adoption method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.  The new standard could impact revenue and cost recognition for a significant number of our contracts, as well as our business processes and information technology systems.  As a result, our evaluation of the effect of the new standard will likely extend over several future periods.   On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral on the effective date for implementation of this standard, which changed the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. 		 

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  .  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 )  ,    which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.    This amendment requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee).  This standard   will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of   ASU 2016-01 will have on our condensed consolidated   financial statements. 		 

Leases.    On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which relates to the accounting of leasing transactions.  This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Financial Instruments   Credit Losses.    On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net earnings.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Statement of Cash Flows   Update  .  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued an update to ASC 230   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ).  This update consists of eight provisions that provide guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments.  If practicable, this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  For the provisions that are impracticable to apply retrospectively, those provisions may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  This update will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 		 

Compensation   Stock Compensation.    On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09   Compensation   Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ),     which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments.  This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including:  (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  During the third quarter 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which had an immaterial impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cost of sales - equipment and other.     Cost of sales - equipment and other  primarily includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent retailers and other independent distributors of our equipment and costs related to equipment sales and other agreements with EchoStar. 

Subscriber acquisition costs  .    While we primarily lease DBS receiver systems, we also subsidize certain costs to attract new subscribers.  Our  Subscriber acquisition costs  include the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems to independent retailers and other independent distributors of our equipment, the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising.  Our  Subscriber acquisition costs  also includes costs associated with acquiring Sling TV subscribers including, among other things, costs related to acquisition advertising, our direct sales efforts and commissions.

Pay-TV SAC.    Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the  average subscriber acquisition costs per new Pay-TV subscriber activation,  or Pay-TV SAC, and we believe presentations of Pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  Our Pay-TV SAC is calculated as  Subscriber acquisition costs,  plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, divided by gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.  We include all the costs of acquiring Pay-TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as we believe it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers.  We also include all new Pay-TV subscribers in our calculation, including Pay-TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.  Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are lower than those for DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. 		 

General and administrative expenses  .     General and administrative expenses  consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems and accounting and finance.  It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. 

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized  primarily includes interest expense (net of capitalized interest), prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt, and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. 

Other, net.    The main components of  Other, net  are gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates. 

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ).    EBITDA is defined as  Net income (loss) attributable to DISH DBS  plus  Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized  net of  Interest income,   Income tax (provision) benefit, net  and  Depreciation and amortization.   This  non-GAAP measure  is reconciled to  Net income (loss) attributable to DISH DBS  in our discussion of  Results of Operations  below. 

Pay-TV subscribers.    We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent retailers and other independent distribution relationships in our Pay-TV subscriber count.  We also provide DISH branded pay-TV service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts.  For certain of these commercial accounts, we previously divided our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our DISH America programming package, and included the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our Pay-TV subscriber count.  During the third quarter 2016, we launched our Flex Pack programming package that represents our lowest tier programming package under which a new subscriber can activate, and, effective September 30, 2016, we began dividing the total revenue for these certain commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our Flex Pack programming package.  The impact of this change was an increase to our ending subscriber count of approximately 166,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2016.  This had no impact on our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber losses or Pay-TV churn rate for all periods presented.  The Sling International video programming service was launched prior to 2015, which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers.  During February and June 2015, we launched our Sling domestic and Sling Latino services, respectively.  All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count.  Sling TV subscribers receiving service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our Pay-TV subscriber count.  Sling TV subscribers are reported net of disconnects in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.  For customers who subscribe to both our DISH branded pay-TV service and our Sling branded pay-TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber.

Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber ( Pay-TV ARPU ).    We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly  Subscriber-related revenue  for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period.  The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period.  The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. 

Pay-TV average monthly subscriber churn rate ( Pay-TV churn rate ).    We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate Pay-TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH branded pay-TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period.  When calculating the Pay-TV churn rate, the same methodology for calculating average number of Pay-TV subscribers is used as when calculating Pay-TV ARPU.  As described above, Sling TV subscribers are reported net of disconnects in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.  Therefore, to the extent that our Sling TV subscriber base grows, our Pay-TV churn rate will be positively impacted.

Pay-TV subscribers.    We lost approximately 116,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the loss of approximately 23,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2015.  The increase in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily resulted from a higher Pay-TV churn rate and lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.

Item 2.      MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Continued 

Our Pay-TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 2.11% compared to 1.86% for the same period in 2015.  Our Pay-TV churn rate continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting.  Our Pay-TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, the credit quality of previously acquired subscribers, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts.    As part of our increased emphasis on retaining higher quality subscribers, we have been more selective in issuing retention credits, which has had a negative impact on our Pay-TV churn rate.  		 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we activated approximately 736,000 gross new Pay-TV subscribers compared to approximately 751,000 gross new Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2015, a decrease of 2.0%.    This decrease in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations was primarily impacted by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, as well as increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Sling TV subscriber activations.  In addition, our ending Pay-TV subscriber count increased by approximately 166,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2016 as a result of the change in our calculation for our commercial accounts.  This had no impact on our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber losses or Pay-TV churn rate for all periods presented.  See    Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items   Pay-TV Subscribers    for further information. 		 

Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers, including, among others, Tribune during the second and third quarters of 2016.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future.  As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses, and higher Pay-TV churn rates. 

We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service.  Most of these factors have affected both gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations as well as Pay-TV churn rate.  Our future gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and our Pay-TV churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth. 

Subscriber-related revenue.     Subscriber-related revenue  totaled $3.618 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $22 million or 0.6% compared to the same period in 2015.  The change in  Subscriber-related revenue  from the same period in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. 

Pay-TV ARPU.      Pay-TV ARPU was $89.44 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus $86.33 during the same period in 2015.  The $3.11 or 3.6% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH branded pay-TV programming package price increases in February 2016 and 2015.  These increases were partially offset by a shift in DISH branded pay-TV programming package mix and an increase in Sling TV subscribers.  Sling TV subscribers generally have lower priced programming packages than DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, and therefore, to the extent that Sling TV subscribers increase, it has a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.

Subscriber-related expenses.     Subscriber-related expenses  totaled $2.151 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $37 million or 1.7% compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in  Subscriber-related expenses  was primarily attributable to higher programming costs, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base.  The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels.   Subscriber-related expenses  represented 59.4% and 58.8% of  Subscriber-related revenue  during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The change in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from higher programming costs, discussed above. 		 

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content.  Our  Subscriber-related expenses  have and may continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.  In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. 

Subscriber acquisition costs.     Subscriber acquisition costs  totaled $391 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $37 million or 8.6% compared to the same period in 2015.  This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in Pay-TV SAC, discussed below, and fewer gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. 

Pay-TV SAC.    Pay-TV SAC was $640 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $736 during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $96 or 13.0%.  This change was primarily attributable to an increase in Sling TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs.  The decrease in hardware costs per activation was primarily due to a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber accounts and by a reduction in manufacturing costs related to certain receiver systems.  This decrease in hardware costs was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber activations with Hopper 3 receiver systems, which have a higher cost per unit than the prior generation Hopper receiver systems.  Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are lower than those for DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, and therefore, to the extent that Sling TV subscriber activations increase, it has a positive impact on Pay-TV SAC. 		 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers totaled $80 million and $125 million, respectively.  This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers resulted primarily from fewer gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, discussed above.  

To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial.  To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the Pay-TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 

Our  Subscriber acquisition costs  and  Pay-TV SAC  may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  .    EBITDA was $711 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1 million or 0.1% compared to the same period in 2015.  The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. 

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Pay-TV subscribers.      We lost approximately 420,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the loss of approximately 69,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2015.  The increase in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily resulted from a higher Pay-TV churn rate and lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations.

Our Pay-TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 1.90% compared to 1.74% for the same period in 2015.  Our Pay-TV churn rate continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting.  Our Pay-TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, the credit quality of previously acquired subscribers, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts.  As part of our increased emphasis on retaining higher quality subscribers, we have been more selective in issuing retention credits, which has had a negative impact on our Pay-TV churn rate. 		 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we activated approximately 1.920 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers compared to approximately 2.112 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2015, a decrease of 9.1%.  This decrease in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations was primarily impacted by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, as well as increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Sling TV subscriber activations.  In addition, our ending Pay-TV subscriber count increased by approximately 166,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2016 as a result of the change in our calculation for our commercial accounts.  This had no impact on our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber losses or Pay-TV churn rate for all periods presented.  See    Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items   Pay-TV Subscribers    for further information. 		 

Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers, including, among others, Tribune during the second and third quarters of 2016.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future.  As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses, and higher Pay-TV churn rates. 

Subscriber-related revenue.     Subscriber-related revenue  totaled $10.988 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $108 million or 1.0% compared to the same period in 2015.  The change in  Subscriber-related revenue  from the same period in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. 

Pay-TV ARPU.      Pay-TV ARPU was $89.12 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $86.66 during the same period in 2015.  The $2.46 or 2.8% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH branded pay-TV programming package price increases in February 2016 and 2015.  These increases were partially offset by a shift in DISH branded pay-TV programming package mix and an increase in Sling TV subscribers.  Sling TV subscribers generally have lower priced programming packages than DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, and therefore, to the extent that Sling TV subscribers increase, it has a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.  Pay-TV ARPU for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was positively impacted by a significant pay-per-view event during the second quarter 2015. 

Subscriber-related expenses.     Subscriber-related expenses  totaled $6.474 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $87 million or 1.4% compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in  Subscriber-related expenses  was primarily attributable to higher programming costs, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base.  The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels.   Subscriber-related expenses  for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the impact of a significant pay-per-view event during the second quarter 2015.   Subscriber-related expenses  represented 58.9% and 58.7% of  Subscriber-related revenue  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The change in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from higher programming costs, discussed above.

Subscriber acquisition costs.     Subscriber acquisition costs  totaled $1.085 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $104 million or 8.7% compared to the same period in 2015.  This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in Pay-TV SAC, discussed below and fewer gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. 

Pay-TV SAC.    Pay-TV SAC was $682 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $722 during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $40 or 5.5%.  This change was primarily attributable to an increase in Sling TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs.  The decrease in hardware costs per activation was primarily due to a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber accounts and by a reduction in manufacturing costs related to certain receiver systems.  This decrease in hardware costs was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber activations with Hopper 3 receiver systems, which have a higher cost per unit than the prior generation Hopper receiver systems.  Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are lower than those for DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, and therefore, to the extent that Sling TV subscriber activations increase, it has a positive impact on Pay-TV SAC. 		 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers totaled $224 million and $335 million, respectively.  This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers resulted primarily from fewer gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, discussed above. 

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  .    EBITDA was $2.378  billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $140 million or 6.3% compared to the same period in 2015.  The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. 

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry.  Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Income tax (provision) benefit, net.    Our income tax provision was $423 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,  an increase of $95 million compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in the provision was primarily related to the increase in  Income (loss) before income taxes  and an increase in our effective tax rate.
