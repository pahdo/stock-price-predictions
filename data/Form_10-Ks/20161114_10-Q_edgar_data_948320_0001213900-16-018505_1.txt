NOTE
ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ) regarding our
company that include, but are not limited to, projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; statements of the plans,
strategies and objectives of management for future operations; statements concerning proposed new products, services or developments;
statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying
any of the foregoing. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about
our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by us. Words such as  anticipates,   expects, 
 intends,   plans,   predicts,   potential,   believes,   seeks, 
 hopes,   estimates,   should,   may,   will,   with a view
to  and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult
to predict. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations
may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results could be materially different from our expectations. Important risks and
factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations are set forth in  Risk Factors, 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,   Our Business 
and other sections in this report. Other sections of this report include additional factors that could adversely impact our business
and financial performance.  

Unless
otherwise indicated, information in this report concerning economic conditions and our industry is based on information from independent
industry analysts and publications, as well as our estimates. Except where otherwise noted, our estimates are derived from publicly
available information released by third party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and are based on such data
and our knowledge of our industry, which we believe to be reasonable. Unless otherwise indicated, none of the independent industry
publication market data cited in this report was prepared on our or our affiliates  behalf.  

The
forward-looking statements made in this report are based only on events or information as of the date on which the statements
are made in this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made
or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report and the documents we refer to in this report
and have filed as exhibits to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially
different from what we expect.  

Additional
information on the various risks and uncertainties potentially affecting our operating results are discussed in this report and
other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). We undertake no obligation to revise
or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties,
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

1.   
       Organization
    and Going Concern    

Immudyne,
Inc. (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation established to develop, manufacture and sell natural immune support
products containing the Company s proprietary yeast beta glucans, a group of beta glucans naturally occurring in the cell
walls of yeast that have been shown through testing and analysis to support the immune system. The Company s products include
once a day oral intake tablets and topical creams and gels for skin application. The Company concentrates its sales and marketing
efforts on healthcare professionals, distributors for its all-natural raw material ingredient products and direct-to-consumer
sales.  

In 2015,
the Company formed a joint venture domiciled in Puerto Rico, Innate Skincare, LLC d/b/a Innate Scientific, LLC ( Innate ).
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, the Company held a 33.3% equity interest, and a 51% controlling voting interest,
in Innate. On January 20, 2016, Innate amended its limited liability company operating agreement and changed its legal name to
Immudyne PR LLC ( Immudyne PR ). On April 1, 2016, Immudyne PR further amended its operating agreement and restated
the Company s ownership and voting interest in Immudyne PR increased to 78.16667% resulting in a charge to noncontrolling
interest and additional paid-in-capital of $91,612. Immudyne PR was formed to launch a complete skin care regime formulated using
strategic ingredients provided by the Company. Immudyne PR is also currently pursuing other opportunities. 

The
Company has funded operations in the past through the sales of its products, issuance of common stock and through loans and advances
from officers and directors. The Company s continued operations are dependent upon obtaining an increase in its sales volume
and the continued financial support from officers and directors or the issuance of additional shares of common stock.  

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated
deficit approximating $9.1 million and has incurred negative cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Based
on the Company's cash balance at September 30, 2016, and projected cash needs for 2017, management estimates that it may need
to increase sales revenue and/or raise additional capital to cover operating and capital requirements for the 2017 year. Management
may raise the additional needed funds through increased sales volume, issuing additional shares of common stock or other equity
securities, or obtaining debt financing. Although management has been successful to date in raising necessary funding, there can
be no assurance that sales revenue will substantially increase or that any required future financing can be successfully completed
on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to the Company.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Unaudited
Financial Statements    

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. The unaudited financial statements
should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Company s previously filed Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting
solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

Basis
of Presentation and Use of Estimates    

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiary, Immudyne PR. The non- controlling
interest in Immudyne PR represents the 21.833% equity interest held by other members of the joint venture. All intercompany transactions
have been eliminated.  

The
Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of
the more significant estimates required to be made by management include the valuation of inventory and stockholders  equity
based transactions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Inventory    

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted primarily of cosmetic and nutraceutical additives, and finished
cosmetic products. Inventory is maintained in the Company s leased Kentucky warehouse and third party warehouses in Pennsylvania
and Louisiana.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)    

Inventory
(continued)    

Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis. Management
compares the cost of inventory with the net realizable value and an allowance is made for writing down inventory to market value,
if lower. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an inventory reserve in the amount of $20,000. Inventory
consists of the following:  

Revenue
Recognition    

The Company s policy
is to record revenue as earned when a firm commitment, indicating sales quantity and price exists, delivery has taken place and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company generally records sales of nutraceutical and cosmetic additives once the product
is shipped to the customer, and for sales of finished cosmetic products once the customer places the order and the product is simultaneously
shipped, but in limited cases if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site, then recognition
of revenue is deferred until that time. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to
the customer. Provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are netted with gross sales.
The Company accounts for such provisions during the same period in which the related revenues are earned. Customer discounts, returns
and rebates approximated $530,000 and $1,578,000 in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
Customer discounts, returns and rebates were not significant in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015. 

Delivery
is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. If title does not pass until the
product reaches the customer s delivery site or the customer accepts the product, then recognition of revenue is deferred
until that time. There are no formal sales incentives offered to any of the Company s customers. Volume discounts may be
offered from time to time to customers purchasing large quantities on a per transaction basis.  

Revenue
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 consisted of nutraceutical and cosmetic additives ($757,961) and finished cosmetic
products ($3,494,743). Revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 consisted solely of nutraceutical and cosmetic
additives. Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 consisted of nutraceutical and cosmetic additives ($229,741)
and finished cosmetic products ($1,154,688). Revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 consisted solely of nutraceutical
and cosmetic additives. 

Accounts
receivable    

Accounts
receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for holdbacks and doubtful receivables based on a review
of all outstanding amounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer
receivables and considering a customer s financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions and sets up
an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is uncertain. Customers  accounts are written off when all attempts to
collect have been exhausted. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as income when received. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the accounts receivable reserve was approximately $122,000 and $18,000, respectively.

Segments    

The
guidance for disclosures about segments of an enterprise requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive
information about its operating segments. Generally, financial information is required to be reported on the basis used internally
for evaluating segment performance and resource allocation. The Company manages its operations in two reportable segments for
purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. Revenue is generated predominately in the United States, and
all significant assets are held in the United States, or United States territories.  

A
summary of the company s reportable segments is as follows:  

As
of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were no assets, sales or net loss relative to the finished cosmetic
products segment.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)    

Income
Taxes    

The Company
files Corporate Federal and State tax returns, while Immudyne PR, which was formed as a limited liability corporation, files a
separate tax return with any tax liabilities or benefits passing through to its members. 

The
Company records current and deferred taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,  Accounting for
Income Taxes.  This ASC requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between tax
basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements, based upon the enacted
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company periodically assesses the value of
its deferred tax asset, a majority of which has been generated by a history of net operating losses and determines the necessity
for a valuation allowance. ASC 740 also provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Using this guidance, a company may recognize the
tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in its financial statements only if it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood
of more than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits
of the position.  

The
Company s tax returns for all years since December 31, 2012, remain open to taxing authorities.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 718,  Share-Based Payment . Under this guidance compensation cost generally
is recognized at fair value on the date of the grant and amortized over the respective vesting periods. The fair value of options
at the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected option life is derived from assumed
exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company s shares using weekly price observations
over an observation period that approximates the expected life of the options. The risk-free rate approximates the U.S. Treasury
yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life. Due to limited history of forfeitures,
the estimated forfeiture rate included in the option valuation was zero.  

Many
of the assumptions require significant judgment and any changes could have a material impact in the determination of stock-based
compensation expense.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)    

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share    

Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period presented. Warrants
and options to purchase common stock are included as common stock equivalents only when dilutive. Potential common stock equivalents
are excluded from dilutive earnings per share when the effects would be antidilutive.  

Common
stock equivalents comprising shares underlying 12,950,273 options and warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 have not been included in the loss per share calculation as the effects are anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents comprising
shares underlying 12,425,800 options and warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have not been included
in the loss per share calculations as the effects are anti-dilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ).
ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice regarding how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance on the classification
of the following items: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from
the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016-15
for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a retrospective basis.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption
of ASU 2016-15. 

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , 
which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification flows of awards as either equity
or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new
guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights
and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent
with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily
will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial
statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early
application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued accounting guidance,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.  The core principle of the new standard is for companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration (that is, payment) to which the company expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance
for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifications)
and clarify guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Accordingly, the Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)    

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements (continued)    

In
July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern . This ASU is intended
to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue
as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. It is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect it to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  

All
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are
not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The carrying
value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued
expenses and the face amount of notes payable approximate fair value for all periods. 

Noncontrolling
Interests    

The
Company accounts for its less than 100% interest in Immudyne PR in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly
the Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its consolidated balance sheet and reports the noncontrolling
interest s share of the Immudyne PR net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of operations.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk    

The
Company grants credit in the normal course of business to its customers. The Company periodically performs credit analysis and
monitors the financial condition of its customers to reduce credit risk.  

The
Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. The Company,
at times, maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)    

Concentration
of Credit Risk (continued)    

One
customer in the nutraceutical and cosmetic additives division accounted for 13% and 81% of consolidated sales for each of the
three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This customer accounted for 15% and 83% of consolidated sales
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This customer accounted for 0% and 43% of accounts
receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

A
second customer in the nutraceutical and cosmetic additives division accounted for 3% and 13% of consolidated sales for each of
the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This customer accounted for 2% and 13% of consolidated
sales for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This customer accounted for 0% and 24% of accounts
receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

3.   
       Notes
    Payable    

The Company periodically borrows from
officers, directors, other related individuals and from commercial lenders. In November 2015 the Company borrowed $100,000 from
a commercial lender. The loan incurs interest at 11% and is payable on November 1, 2016 (See Note 9). Interest expense related
to this loan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $2,750 and $8,250, respectively. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 interest expense related to a loan from a second commercial lender amounted to $5,175
and $23,517, respectively. 

In the third quarter of 2016 the Company
commenced an offering pursuant to which it offered 11% subordinated promissory notes due in six (6) months in fifty thousand ($50,000)
dollar increments combined with 62,500 shares of the Company s Common Stock for a maximum offering amount of $200,000 (the
 Offering ). In August and September 2016, the Company sold promissory notes totaling $150,000 to three unrelated individuals.
Two of the promissory notes totaling $100,000 are payable in February 2017 and one promissory note for $50,000 is payable in March
2017. In connection with these promissory notes sold pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued 187,500 shares of common stock
valued at $41,875 which was recorded as a debt discount and will be amortized over the term of these notes. Amortization of the
debt discounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,990. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance
of these notes were $150,000. Interest expense related to these notes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to
$1,253. 

Interest expense related to loans
from officers, directors and other related individuals amounted to $313 and $9,531 for the nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $0 and $9,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Total interest expense on
notes payable, inclusive of amortization of debt discount of $5,990 and $0, amounted to $15,805 and $33,048 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total interest expense, inclusive of amortization of debt discount of $5,990 and
$0, amounted to $9,992 and $14,422 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

4.   
       Income
    Taxes    

The
Company is not expected to have taxable income in 2016 and incurred a loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 and accordingly,
no provision for federal income tax has been made in the accompanying financial statements. At December 31, 2015, the Company
had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2,730,000, expiring during various years through 2035.  

A
summary of the deferred tax asset using an approximate 34% tax rate is as follows:  

The
net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation in any given year in the event of a change in ownership as defined
by IRC Section 382.  

The deferred
tax benefit included in the 2015 statement of operations represents the change in the deferred tax liability at each balance sheet
date. 

The
difference between the statutory and the effective tax rate is primarily due to a change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes,
as the Company has fully reserved the deferred tax asset resulting from available net operating loss carryforwards.

       Stockholders 
    Equity    

On April 1, 2016, the Company entered
into two agreements with two consultants to provide services over a nine month period in exchange for 2,300,000 shares of common
stock. The Company calculated a fair value of $690,000 based on the market price of the shares on the date of the agreements. During
the third quarter of 2016, the Company and the consultants renegotiated the agreements by extending the service requirement to
December 31, 2017. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized expense of $76,667 and $306,667,
respectively, in connection with these agreements. 

On September 1, 2016, the Company
issued 200,000 shares of common stock for $46,000. In connection with this issuance the Company issued 100,000 warrants with an
exercise price of $0.50 per share. These warrants are fully vested and expire in two years. 

In August 2016, the Company issued
125,000 shares of common stock pursuant to sale of two promissory notes in the Offering. 

In September 2016, the Company issued
62,500 shares of common stock pursuant to the sale of one promissory note in the Offering. 

In the third quarter of 2016, the
Company purchased 19,363 shares of outstanding Company common stock through an exchange for a price per share of $0.23 to $0.26.
As of the September 30, 2016, these shares being held by the Company valued at cost is $4,720 and are included in treasury stock
in the consolidated balance sheet. 

Service-Based
Stock Options    

In
May 2016, the Company issued 175,000 service-based options valued at $40,829 to two consultants at exercise prices of $0.20 per
share. The options are fully vested and expire in 10 years.  

In
July 2016, the Company issued 50,000 service-based options valued at $12,398 to a consultant with an exercise price of $0.20 per
share. The options are fully vested and expire in 10 years.  

Accordingly,
stock based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $12,398 and $53,227, respectively, related
to such options.  

A
Summary of the outstanding service-based options are as follows:  

All
outstanding options are exercisable and have a cashless exercise provision, and certain options provide for accelerated vesting
provisions and modifications, as defined, if the Company is sold or acquired. The intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable
at September 30, 2016 amounted to $750,294.   

The
significant assumptions used to determine the fair values of options issued, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as
follows:

Stock Options (continued)    

The
following is a summary of outstanding service-based options at September 30, 2016:  

Performance-Based
Stock Options    

The
Company had granted performance-based options to purchase 4,400,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices of $0.40 to $0.80.
The options expire at various dates between 2021 and 2026 and are exercisable upon the Company achieving annual sales revenue
of $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The fair value of these performance-based options aggregated $169,035 to be expensed over the implicit
service period commencing once management believes the performance criteria will be met.  

Management
believes the performance criteria for options exercisable upon the Company achieving annual sales revenue of $5,000,000, with
a fair value amounting to $133,324, will be met during the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, stock based compensation
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $55,591 and $133,324, respectively, related to such options.
At September 30, 2016, the unearned compensation for all the performance based options is $35,711.  

Stock based
compensation expense amounted to $165,241 and $10,500 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Stock based compensation expense amounted to $513,804 and $14,500 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Such amounts are included in compensation and related expenses in the accompanying statement of operations. 

Warrants

and related expenses in the accompanying statement of operations.  

Warrants
outstanding and exercisable amounted to 1,950,000 and 1,750,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The

The Company was subject to
a royalty agreement based upon sales of certain skin care products. The agreement required the Company to pay a royalty based
upon 8% of such sales, up to $227,175. During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company s sales reached the maximum amount

Legal
Matters    

In
the normal course of business operations the Company may become involved in various legal matters. At September 30, 2016, the
Company s management does not believe that there are any potential legal matters that could have an adverse effect on the
Company s financial position.

Item 2.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations    

Overview   

We
manufacture, distribute and sell natural immune support products; namely proprietary yeast beta glucans which are natural extracts
that have been shown through testing and analysis and scientific research to support the immune system. Yeast beta glucans are
classified as generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ). We are
and have been a science driven company for more than 25 years. Our products are used in oral and topical applications. Historically,
we have sold our proprietary additives, for both oral and topical use, primarily via business-to-business to large dietary supplement
and cosmetic companies. During fiscal year 2015 we have seen increased interest in our proprietary GRAS topical delivery system,
which we believe may have additional beneficial and marketable uses (both topically and orally) and on which are conducting further
testing. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a joint venture, that does business under the name Inate
Scientific LLC ( Inate ), to launch a complete skin care regimen that contains our proprietary ingredients and which
contributed to our revenues in the first nine months of 2016. The Company entered into a limited liability company operating agreement
with its joint venture partners with respect to Inate under the legal name Immudyne PR LLC ( Immudyne PR ). On April
1, 2016, the original operating agreement was amended and restated and we increased our ownership and voting interest in Immudyne
PR to 78.16667%. As a result of our ownership and control of Immudyne PR, we now operate in two business segments, nutraceutical
and cosmetic additives and finished cosmetic products.  

We
have performance based contracts with our sales and marketing executives, which allows us to continue to maintain a relatively
low overhead. Our priority is to pursue opportunities to market our products and increase sales. We expect that a significant
component of our selling, general and administration expenses going forward will consist of equipment leasing costs relating to
improving our operating efficiencies, as well as conducting new studies which could open new markets. These aforementioned costs,
along with the additional costs resulting from our operations as a public reporting company, could adversely impact our future
results of operations. Additional significant factors that we believe will affect our operating results going forward are: (i)
protection of our intellectual property rights; (ii) imposition of more stringent government regulations of our products; and
(iii) marketing expenses.  

We
historically have expended a significant amount of our funds on obtaining and protecting our patents, trade secrets and proprietary
products. We rely on the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S. to protect our intellectual property and maintain our
competitive position in the marketplace. For several years, we were involved in complex litigation regarding patents and licenses
critical to our products. In 2010, we prevailed on all major legal matters and reached favorable settlements. If additional litigation
becomes necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, such litigation may be costly, divert our management s attention
away from our core business and have a negative impact on our operations. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that litigation would
result in an outcome favorable to us. In addition, yeast beta glucans are designated as GRAS under current FDA regulations. Future
government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction or require the reformulation of our products. Some agencies, such
as the FDA, could require us to remove a particular product from the market, delay or prevent the import of raw materials for
the manufacture of our products or otherwise disrupt the marketing of our products. Any such government actions could result in
additional costs to us, reduced growth prospects, lost sales from products that we are required to remove from the market and
potential product liability litigation.  

We have historically operated with limited
capital and have funded operations in the past through the sales of our products and loans and advances from Mark McLaughlin,
our President, and other directors. In 2015 we entered into a non-dilutive short term loan agreement with an investor for $100,000
and secured additional loans of $30,000 from our President and $75,000 from a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company. These
loans were satisfied in full as of December 31, 2015. In addition, in November 2015, we established a $100,000 line of credit
with a commercial lender for our short-term working capital needs, which has since been repaid in full. In the third quarter of
2016 the Company sold $150,000 of 11% subordinated promissory notes due in six (6) months in fifty thousand ($50,000) dollar increments
combined with 62,500 shares of the Company s common stock. We plan on our operating business (in conjunction with our short
term non-dilutive borrowings) to be able to fund operations through 2016. However, in the event we require additional operating
capital we may have to depend on sources other than operating revenues to meet our operating and capital needs. No assurance can
be given that such sources will be available and no assurance can be given that Mr. McLaughlin or other directors who have in
the past willingly funded operations will commit to do so in the future, or that we will be successful in our endeavors to raise
additional capital. For additional information regarding these and other risks please see our Annual Report on Form 10K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales:  

Overall
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1.38 million, an increase of 395% from $0.28 million for the same period
in 2015. Our increase in sales was primarily attributable to sales made by our finished cosmetic products segment of $1.15 million
through our joint venture with Inate, which did not operate in the period ended September 30, 2015. Net sales for our nutraceutical
and cosmetic additives segment remained relatively consistent between periods at $0.22 million and were in line with our expectations.  

Cost of sales consists primarily of material
costs, labor costs, marketing costs and related overhead directly attributable to the production of our products. Total cost of
sales increased 1174% to $0.94 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.07 million for the same period in 2015, which
costs in the 2015 period were solely attributable to our nutraceutical and cosmetic additives product segment. The increase in
our cost of sales was due to our increased advertising and marketing expenses incurred to generate our increase in sales from
our finished cosmetic products segment, which costs were not incurred in the third quarter of 2015. 

Gross
profit increased 155% to $0.44 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 million for the same period in 2015 as a
result of our increased sales offset by our advertising and marketing expenses for the quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of
sales decreased to 32% in the third quarter of 2016 from 74% for the same period in 2015 due to the shift in the composition of
our sales between periods from solely topical and oral additives to primarily finished products sold through Inate, which products
generally have lower margins.  

Operating expenses consisted of general
and administrative expense, compensation and related expense and professional fees. Overall operating expenses increased 246%
to $0.65 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $0.19 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased compensation
related expenses with respect to shares issued to the Company s joint venture partners pursuant to previously disclosed
service agreements. The increase in our overall operating expenses was also due to our increase in sales. General and administration
expense increased 256% to $0.20 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $0.06 million for the same period in 2015. Compensation
and related expense increased 258% to $0.36 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $0.10 million for the same period in 2015
due to the aforementioned share issuance. Professional fees increased 183% to $0.08 million in the third quarter of 2016 from
approximately $0.03 million for the same period in 2015, due to increased legal and accounting fees incurred with respect to Inate s
operations. 

Net loss attributable to Immudyne in
the third quarter of 2016 was approximately $0.27 million compared to net income of $0.01 million for the same period in 2015.
We consolidated the operations of our joint venture, Inate, and reflected a non-controlling interest for 21.833% of these operations.
Net loss attributable to Immudyne, Inc. as a percentage of sales was 16% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to net income as
a percentage of sales of 3% for the same period in 2015. Our net loss notwithstanding our substantial increase in sales was primarily
due to the advertising and marketing expenses we incurred in the quarter to help generate sales and our increased compensation
expenses due to shares issued to the Company s joint venture partners pursuant to previously disclosed service agreements.
We believe these costs will decrease as a percentage of sales over the course of the fiscal year as Inate continues to mature as
a business. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales:  

Overall
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.25 million, an increase of 403% from $0.85 million for the same period
in 2015. Our increase in sales was primarily attributable to sales made by our finished cosmetic products segment of $3.49 million
through our joint venture with Inate, which did not operate in the period ended September 30, 2015. Net sales for our nutraceutical
and cosmetic additives segment remained relatively consistent between periods at $0.78 million and were in line with our expectations.  

Cost
of sales consists primarily of material costs, labor costs, marketing costs and related overhead directly attributable to the
production of our products. Total cost of sales increased 1,154% to $2.98 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $0.24 million for the same period in 2015, which costs in the 2015 period were solely attributable to our nutraceutical
and cosmetic additives product segment. The increase in our cost of sales was due to our significant up-front advertising and
marketing expenses ($1.71 million) incurred to generate our significant increase in sales from our finished cosmetic products
segment, which costs were not incurred in the 2015 period.  

Gross
profit increased 109% to $1.27 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.61 million for the same period
in 2015 as result of our increased sales offset by our significant up-front advertising and marketing expenses in the 2016 period.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 72% for the same period
in 2015 due to the shift in the composition of our sales between periods from solely topical and oral additives to primarily finished
products through Inate, which products generally have lower margins.  

Operating
expenses consisted of general and administrative expense, compensation and related expense and professional fees. Overall operating
expenses increased 190% to $1.74 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.60 million for the same period in
2015. The increase in our overall operating expenses was due primarily to our operation of Inate in the 2016 year whereas we only
had operations in our nutraceutical and cosmetic additives segment in the comparable 2015 period. General and administration expense
increased 85% to $0.38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.21 million for the same period in 2015. Compensation
and related expense increased 258% to $1.08 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.30 million for the same
period in 2015 due primarily to increased compensation related expenses with respect to shares issued to the Company s joint
venture partners pursuant to previously disclosed service agreements. Professional fees increased 205% to $0.27 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.09 million for the same period in 2015, due to increased legal and
accounting fees incurred with respect to Inate s operations.  

Net loss attributable to Immudyne in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.49 million compared to net loss of $0.01 million for the same period
in 2015. We consolidated the operations of our joint venture, Inate, and reflected a non-controlling interest for 21.833% of these
operations. Net loss attributable to Immudyne, Inc. as a percentage of sales was 11% in nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to net loss as a percentage of sales of 1% for the same period in 2015. Our net loss notwithstanding our substantial increase
in sales was primarily due to the substantial up-front advertising and marketing expenses we incurred to help generate sales through
our recently formed joint venture, Inate, and our increased compensation expenses due to shares issued to the Company s
joint venture partners pursuant to previously disclosed service agreements. We believe these costs will decrease as a percentage
of sales as Inate continues to mature as a business. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
principal demands for liquidity are to increase sales, purchase inventory and for sales distribution and general corporate purposes.
We incurred negative operating cash flows in the 2015 and 2014 fiscal years and for the first three quarters of 2016. As a result,
our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan on our operating business
(in conjunction with our short term non-dilutive borrowings) being able to fund operations through 2016. However, if necessary,
we may raise additional capital through a private placement of common stock, obtaining debt financing or from advances from our
President and/or directors; however, no assurances can be made that we will be successful in our endeavors to raise additional
capital.  

In 2015 we entered into a non-dilutive short
term loan agreement with an investor for $100,000 and secured additional loans of $30,000 from our President and $75,000 from
a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company. These loans were satisfied in full as of December 31, 2015. In addition, in November
2015, we secured a $100,000 line of credit with a commercial lender for our short-term working capital needs, which has since
been repaid in full. In the third quarter of 2016 the Company sold $150,000 of 11% subordinated promissory notes due in six (6)
months in fifty thousand ($50,000) dollar increments combined with 62,500 shares of the Company s common stock. 

There
can be no assurance that required future financing can be successfully completed on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to
us. Any future issuance of equity securities could cause dilution to our shareholders. Any incurrence of indebtedness would increase
our debt service obligations and would cause us to be subject to restrictive operating and financial covenants.  

We
had net working capital of approximately $457,066 at September 30, 2016, resulting in an increase from net working capital of
approximately ($136,841) at September 30, 2015. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.7 to 1 at September 30,
2016.  

The
following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:  

Net cash flow used by operating activities
was $0.11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash flow used in operating activities of $0.08
million for the same period in 2015. The increase in the amount of cash used by our operating activities was due to up-front advertising
and marketing expenses incurred in the 2016 period. We expect that these expenses will decrease as a percentage of sales over the
course of the fiscal year as Inate continues to mature as a business. 

Net cash flows provided by financing activities
was $0.35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of
$0.08 million for the same period in 2015 due to additional indebtedness incurred during the period as further described below. 

Indebtedness    

From
time to time, our directors, officers and other related individuals have made short-term advances to us for our operating needs.
In 2015 we entered into a non-dilutive short term loan agreement with an investor for $100,000 and secured additional loans of
$30,000 from our President and $75,000 from a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company. These loans were satisfied in full as
of December 31, 2015. In addition, in November 2015, we secured a $100,000 line of credit with a commercial lender for our short-term
working capital needs, which has since been repaid in full. In the third quarter of 2016 the Company sold $150,000 of 11% subordinated
promissory notes due in six (6) months in fifty thousand ($50,000) dollar increments combined with 62,500 shares of the Company s
Common Stock.  

We
are subject to a royalty agreement pursuant to which we are required to pay a monthly royalty of 8% on all sales of certain skin
care products up to $227,175. During the year ended December 31, 2015 our sales reached the maximum amount under which we are
required to pay a royalty under this agreement. Royalty expense amounted to $0 and $20,157 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2015, our President, who has a 60% interest in the royalties, converted all royalties
payable (in the amount of $84,868) to 499,225 shares of the company s stock valued at $0.17 cents a share.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to shareholders.  

We
have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholders  equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

While
our significant accounting policies are described more fully in Note 2 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting
policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.  

Basis
of Presentation and Use of Estimates   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.,
or U.S. GAAP. In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
required by management include the valuation of inventory and stockholders  equity-based transactions. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.  

Inventory   

Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Management compares the cost
of inventory with the net realizable value and an allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market value, if lower.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The Company s policy is to record
revenue as earned when a firm commitment, indicating sales quantity and price exists, delivery has taken place and collectability
is reasonably assured. The Company generally records sales of nutraceutical and cosmetic additives once the product is shipped
to the customer, and for sales of finished cosmetic products once the customer places the order and the product is simultaneously
shipped, but in limited cases if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site, then recognition
of revenue is deferred until that time. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to
the customer. Provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are netted with gross sales.
The Company accounts for such provisions during the same period in which the related revenues are earned. Customer discounts, returns
and rebates approximated $530,000 and $1,578,000 in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
Customer discounts, returns and rebates were not significant in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015. 

Delivery
is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. If title does not pass until the
product reaches the customer s delivery site, then recognition of revenue is deferred until that time. There are no formal
sales incentives offered to any of the Company s customers. Volume discounts may be offered from time to time to customers
purchasing large quantities on a per transaction basis.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 718,  Share-Based Payment . Under this guidance compensation cost generally
is recognized at fair value on the date of the grant and amortized over the respective vesting periods. The fair value of options
at the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected option life is derived from assumed
exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our shares using weekly price observations over
an observation period that approximates the expected life of the options. The risk-free rate approximates the U.S. Treasury yield
curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life. Due to limited history of forfeitures,
estimated forfeiture rate included in the option valuation was zero. Many of the assumptions require significant judgment and
any changes could have a material impact in the determination of stock-based compensation expense.  

Noncontrolling
Interests   

The Company accounts for its less than
100% interest in Inate in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly the Company presents noncontrolling interests
as a component of equity on its consolidated balance sheet and reports the noncontrolling interest s share of Inate net loss
attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of operations. 

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU
2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice regarding how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance on the classification of
the following items: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from
the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016-15
for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a retrospective basis.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption
of ASU 2016-15. 

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which
relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities;
and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new
guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights
and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent
with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily
will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial
statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early
application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued accounting guidance,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.  The core principle of the new standard is for companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration (that is, payment) to which the company expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance
for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifications)
and clarify guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Accordingly, the Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern . This ASU is intended
to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue
as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. It is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect it to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  

All
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are
not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  

Item 3.   
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk    

Not
applicable.  

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ),
who is also our Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ), of the design and effectiveness of our  disclosure controls
and procedures  (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our PEO/PFO concluded that as of the end of the period covered by
this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures which are
indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment as the
Company had only one officer; (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect
to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC Guidelines; and (iii) inadequate security and restricted access to
computer systems including insufficient disaster recovery plans; and (iv) no written whistleblower policy. If and when sufficient
funds are available, our PEO/PFO plans to implement appropriate disclosure controls and procedures to remediate these material
weaknesses, including (i) appointing additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective
risk management; (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting and a whistle blower
policy; and (iii) implement sufficient security and restricted access measures regarding our computer systems and implement a
disaster recovery plan.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.   
       Legal Proceedings    

We
may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may have an adverse
effect on our business, financial conditions or operating results. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or
claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results.

in six (6) months in fifty thousand ($50,000) dollar increments combined with 62,500 shares of the Company s common stock
for a maximum offering amount of $200,000. In August and September 2016, the Company sold promissory notes totaling $150,000 to
three unrelated individuals in connection with this offering. The Company issued the notes and common stock to accredited investors
only pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  

On

    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
    supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal
    control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board
    of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
