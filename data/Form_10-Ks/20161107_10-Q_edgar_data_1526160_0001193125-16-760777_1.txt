    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)   
  (Unaudited)      1. Nature of the Business
    Fleetmatics Group PLC (the  Company ) is a public limited company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The Company is
a leading global provider of mobile workforce solutions for service-based businesses of all sizes delivered as software-as-a-service ( SaaS ). Its mobile software platform enables businesses to meet the challenges associated with
managing their local fleets of commercial vehicles and improve productivity by extracting actionable business intelligence from real-time and historical vehicle and driver behavioral data. The Company offers intuitive, cost-effective Web-based and
mobile solutions that provide fleet operators with visibility into vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage and other insights into their mobile workforce, enabling them to reduce operating and capital costs, as well as increase revenue. An
integrated, full-featured mobile workforce management product provides additional efficiencies related to job management by empowering the field worker and expediting the job completion process from quote through payment.  
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
   Basis of Presentation      The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, except share and per share amounts, are stated in thousands of
U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated.    The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the consolidated
statements of operations and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of its operations and its comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The consolidated financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are also
unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other interim periods or future year.  
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company s annual audited consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes have been condensed or omitted in these interim financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016.  
   Fair Value Measurements      Certain
assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value
hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable, is used to measure fair value:      

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016 designated as Level 1.    

Level 2 Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets
or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. The Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016 designated as Level 2.    
      7  

Table of Contents  

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies and similar techniques. The Company has a contingent consideration liability assumed as a result of the acquisitions of Ornicar SAS ( Ornicar ) and of Inosat   Consultoria Inform tica, S.A. ( Inosat ) of
$4,126 as of September 30, 2016 designated as Level 3. The Company s contingent purchase consideration is valued by probability weighting expected payment scenarios and then applying a discount based on the present value of the future cash
flow streams. This liability is classified as Level 3 because the probability weighting of future payment scenarios is based on assumptions developed by management. The Company determined a probability weighting that is weighted towards Ornicar
achieving certain unit sales and pricing targets at the time of acquisition and the discount rate that is based on the Company s weighted average cost of capital which is then adjusted for the time value of money. The Company determined a
probability weighting that is weighted towards Inosat achieving certain unit sales, pricing targets and EBITDA at the time of acquisition and the discount rate that is based on the Company s weighted average cost of capital which is then
adjusted for the time value of money. The probability weightings will be adjusted as the actual results provide the Company with more reliable information to weight the probability scenarios.    
 The carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no other assets or liabilities that would be classified under this fair value hierarchy.  
   Deferred Commissions      The Company
capitalizes commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of new customer contracts with a term of greater than one year. For the majority of its customer contracts, the Company pays commissions in full when it
receives the initial customer contract for a new subscription or a renewal subscription. For all other customer contracts, the Company pays commissions in full when it receives the initial customer payment for a new subscription or a renewal
subscription. Commission costs are capitalized upon payment and are amortized as expense ratably over the term of the related non-cancelable customer contract, in proportion to the recognition of the subscription revenue. If a subscription agreement
is terminated, the unamortized portion of any deferred commission cost is recognized as expense immediately.    Commission costs capitalized
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $3,156 and $4,103, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $10,104 and $9,741, respectively. Amortization of deferred commissions
totaled $3,042 and $2,465 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled $8,945 and $7,412 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in sales and marketing
expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commission costs, net of amortization, are included in other current and long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $18,620 and $17,518 as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Foreign exchange differences also contribute to changes in the net amount of these deferred commission costs.  
   Capitalized In-Vehicle Device Costs    
 For in-vehicle devices of which the Company retains ownership after they are installed in a customer s fleet, the cost of the  in-vehicle  devices (including installation and shipping costs) is capitalized as property and equipment. The Company depreciates these costs over the minimum estimated useful life of the devices or over the
estimated average customer relationship period, which are both currently six years, beginning upon completion of installation. Related depreciation expense is recorded in cost of subscription revenue. If a customer subscription agreement is canceled
or expires prior to the end of the expected useful life of the  in-vehicle  device, the carrying value of the asset is depreciated in full with expense immediately recorded as cost of subscription revenue.
Before installation in a customer s fleet, in-vehicle devices of which the Company retains ownership are recorded within property and equipment (referred to as In-vehicle devices uninstalled), but are not depreciated.  
 For the limited number of customer arrangements in which title to the in-vehicle devices transfers to the customer upon delivery or
installation of the in-vehicle device (for which the Company receives an up-front fee from the customer), the Company defers the costs of the installed in-vehicle devices (including installation and shipping costs) as they are directly related to
the revenue that the Company derives from the sale of the devices and that it recognizes ratably over the estimated average customer relationship period of six years. The Company capitalizes these in-vehicle device costs and amortizes the
deferred costs as expense ratably over the estimated average customer relationship period, in proportion to the recognition of the up-front fee revenue.  
 Costs of in-vehicle devices owned by customers that were capitalized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled
$379 and $392, respectively. Amortization of these capitalized costs totaled $122 and $639 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in cost of subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of
operations. Generally, the Company does not enter into customer arrangements whereby title to the in-vehicle devices transfers to the customer upon delivery or installation of the in-vehicle device.

    Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )  2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15  is intended to
reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination,
proceeds from insurance settlements, and distributions from certain equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-15 requires
application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets
to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Additionally, ASU 2016-02 modifies current guidance for lessors  accounting. The standard will be effective for the first
interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
Adjustment  ( ASU 2015-16 ). ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
Prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The standard was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the
presentation of a debt discount. Prior to the issuance of the standard, debt issuance costs were required to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset. The standard was effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly
all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to
be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing
GAAP. The standard requires either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or
(ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the
effective date of the new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also proposed permitting early adoption of the standard, but not
before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. In April 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing , which clarifies certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients,  related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected
from customers. These standards have the same effective date and transition date of December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption
of the new revenue recognition standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

    4. Property and Equipment   
 Property and equipment consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment totaled $9,288
and $7,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled $27,746 and $20,520 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of those amounts, $8,362 and $6,470 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $24,907 and $18,350 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was recorded in cost of subscription revenue primarily related to depreciation of installed
in-vehicle devices and amortization of internal-use software and the remaining costs were included in various operating expenses. The carrying value of installed in-vehicle devices (including shipping and installation costs), net of accumulated
depreciation, was $78,690 and $76,835 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company capitalized costs of $5,134 and $3,222, respectively, associated with the development of its internal-use software related to its SaaS software offerings accessed by customers as well as customization
and development of its internal business systems. Amortization expense of the internal-use software totaled $1,092 and $662 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $2,995 and $1,613 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The carrying value of capitalized internal-use software was $9,423 and $7,125 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Foreign exchange differences also contribute
to changes in the carrying value of internal-use software.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the gross amount of
assets under capital leases totaled $7,784 and $6,749, respectively, and related accumulated amortization totaled $4,181 and $2,564, respectively.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed $881 and $1,005, respectively, and during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 expensed $2,622 and $2,224, respectively, primarily in conjunction with installed in-vehicle devices requiring replacement. The expense was recorded in cost of subscription revenue and is included in loss on
disposal of property and equipment and other assets in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

   5. Business Combination   
 On September 2, 2016, the Company acquired all of the stock and equity interests of Inosat   Consultoria Inform tica, S.A.
( Inosat ), a Portugal-based privately-held SaaS-based provider of fleet management solutions. The total consideration of $24,886 consisted of $21,633 of cash paid to acquire all of the assets of Inosat and to assume a nominal amount of
liabilities and $3,253 of contingent consideration. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill of $14,831. This acquisition reflects the Company s global growth
strategy to further expand into mainland Europe and to acquire additional customers in new territories.    The following table summarizes
the purchase price for Inosat and the estimated fair values of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 2, 2016:      
   The estimated fair value of the intangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date was $9,705 with a useful
life of three to eight years. The acquired intangible assets consisted of customer relationships, developed technology and trademarks.  
 The results of Inosat have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of September 2, 2016. The

    10. Long-term Debt   
   Credit Facility      On
January 21, 2015, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, for a senior, first-priority secured financing comprised of revolving loans, letters of credit and swing
line loans in a total maximum amount of $125,000 (the  Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility is collateralized by a senior first lien by certain assets and property of the Company. The Credit Facility consists of a five-year
multi-currency revolving credit facility in a dollar amount of up to $125,000 which includes a sublimit of $5,000 for letters of credit and a $10,000 swing line facility. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that allows the Company
to increase the Credit Facility to a total of $200,000, subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions. The Company used the net proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Facility to repay the $23,750
outstanding under the Company s previously existing revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC ( Amended Revolving Credit Facility ), and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As a result of
the early repayment of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, in the first quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $107, comprised of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.  
 At the Company s election, loans made under the Credit Facility bear interest at either (1) a rate per annum equal to the highest of
the Administrative Agent s prime rate, or 0.5% in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate or 2.0% in excess of one-month LIBOR (the  Base Rate ), plus an applicable margin, or (2) the one-, two-, three-, or six-month per annum
LIBOR for deposits in U.S. Dollars, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the revolving loans depends on the Company s leverage ratio and varies from 0.5% to 1.25%, in the case of Base Rate loans, and from 1.50% to 2.25%, in
the case of LIBOR loans. Swing line loans bear interest at the Base Rate. Commitment fees on the average daily unused portion of the Credit Facility (excluding swing line loans) are payable at rates per annum ranging from 0.2% to 0.3%, depending on
the Company s leverage ratio.    On the issuance date of January 21, 2015, the Credit Facility was recorded in the consolidated
balance sheet net of discount of $708, related to fees assessed by the lender at the time. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded additional fees related to the debt of $159. The carrying value of this debt is being accreted to the
principal amount of the debt by charges to interest expense using the effective-interest method over the five-year term of the Credit Facility to the maturity date. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the debt discount balance
totaled $585 and $717, respectively. Accretion amounts recognized as interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $44 and $44, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
totaled $132 and $107, respectively. On the issuance date, the Company also capitalized deferred financing costs of $501 related to third-party fees incurred in connection with the Credit Facility. These deferred costs are being amortized through
charges to interest expense using the effective-interest method over the five-year term of the Credit Facility to the expiration date. At September 30, 2016, deferred financing cost recorded in other current assets and other assets
(non-current) were $100 and $232, respectively, and totaled $332. Amortization amounts recognized as interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $25 and $25, respectively, and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $75 and $70, respectively.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain customary financial, affirmative and negative covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and negative covenants that limit or restrict,
among other things, dividends, secured indebtedness, mergers and fundamental changes, asset dispositions and sales, investments and acquisitions, liens and encumbrances, transactions with affiliates, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be repaid and, subject to customary terms and conditions, re-borrowed at any time during and up to the maturity date. Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due and payable no
later than January 21, 2020. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

   11. Income Taxes   
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was (2056.8)% and (12.1)%,
respectively, on pre-tax income (loss) of $(37) thousand and $7,235, respectively. The effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the net loss in the period.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions upon the expiration of a statute of limitation in
Ireland, income being generated in a jurisdiction that has a lower tax rate than the Irish statutory rate and the Irish research and development tax credit.  
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was (4.4)% and 7.9%, respectively, on
pre-tax income of $8,443 and $28,203, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was lower than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the release of various historical uncertain tax
positions including interest and penalties in the third quarter and by research and development tax credits in Ireland. These decreases were partially offset by the recording of uncertain tax positions. The Company made a change to its
organizational structure in the fourth quarter of 2014 that impacted the jurisdictional mix of profits and was beneficial to our income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the Company s unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest, may decrease by
up to $328. This is primarily due to statute of limitations expiring for the recognition of these tax benefits of one of the Company s Irish subsidiaries in 2017.  
  12. Share-Based Awards       2011 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan      In September 2011, the Board of Directors adopted and the Company s shareholders approved the 2011 Stock
Option and Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ). The 2011 Plan permits the Company to make grants of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units and cash-based awards at an exercise price no less than the
fair market value per share of the Company s ordinary shares on the grant date and with a maximum term of seven years. These awards may be granted to the Company s employees and non-employee directors. Pursuant to the terms of the 2011
Plan, the number of ordinary shares reserved for issuance under the 2011 Plan automatically increases by 4.75% of the outstanding ordinary shares issued and outstanding on an annual basis as of January 31. As of September 30, 2016,
the number of ordinary shares reserved for issuance under the 2011 Plan was 7,282,645. This number is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in our capitalization.  
 The Company grants share-based awards with employment service conditions only ( service-based  awards) and share-based awards with
both employment service and performance conditions ( performance-based  awards). The Company applies the fair value recognition provisions for all share-based awards granted or modified and records compensation costs over the requisite
service period of the award based on the grant-date fair value. The straight-line method is applied to all service-based awards granted, while the graded-vesting method is applied to all performance-based awards granted. The requisite service period
for service-based awards is generally four years, with restrictions lapsing evenly over the period.      Stock Option Activity    
 Stock option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:

    2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan    
 In September 2012, the Company s Board of Directors adopted and its shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan, which
became effective upon the closing of the Company s initial public offering ( IPO ) in October 2012. The 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000 ordinary shares to participating employees.  
 Employees of certain subsidiaries of the Company who have been employed for at least 30 days and whose customary employment is for more than
20 hours per week are eligible to participate in the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan. Any employee who owns 5% or more of the voting power or value of ordinary shares is not eligible to purchase shares under the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan.
The Company will make one or more offerings each year to its employees to purchase shares under the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan. The first offering began during 2013 and subsequent offerings will usually begin on each May 1st and
November 1st and will continue for six-month periods, referred to as offering periods. Each eligible employee may elect to participate in any offering by submitting an enrollment form at least 15 days before the relevant offering date.  
 Each employee who is a participant in the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan may purchase shares by authorizing payroll deductions of up to 15%
of his or her base compensation during an offering period. Unless the participating employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase ordinary shares on the last business day of
the offering period at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the first business day or the last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower, provided that no more than 2,500 ordinary shares may be
purchased by any one employee during each offering period. Under applicable tax rules, an employee may purchase no more than $25 worth of ordinary shares, valued at the start of the purchase period, under the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan in any
calendar year.    The accumulated payroll deductions of any employee who is not a participant on the last day of an offering period will be
refunded. An employee s rights under the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan terminate upon voluntary withdrawal from the plan or when the employee ceases employment with the Company for any reason.  
 The 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan may be terminated or amended by the Board of Directors at any time. An amendment that increases the
number of ordinary shares that are authorized under the 2012 Employee Share Purchase Plan and certain other amendments require the approval of the Company s shareholders.  
   Restricted Stock Unit Awards      In
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted service-based restricted stock units ( RSUs ) for the purchase of 1,107,111 ordinary shares and performance-based restricted stock units ( PSUs ) for the purchase
of 426,804 ordinary shares with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $42.16. The RSUs have restrictions which lapse four years from the date of grant. Restrictions on the PSUs will lapse based upon the achievement of certain financial
performance targets during the applicable performance period, which ends on December 31, 2016. The grant date fair value of the shares is recognized over the requisite period of performance once achievement of criteria is deemed probable.
Periodically throughout the performance period, the Company estimates the likelihood of achieving performance goals. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates. If the
targets are not achieved, the shares will be forfeited by the employee.    The following table summarizes unvested RSUs and PSUs activity
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

    14. Commitments and Contingencies   
   Lease Commitments      The Company
leases its office space under non-cancelable operating leases, some of which contain payment escalations. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and records the difference between
cash rent payments and rent expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as accrued rent within accrued expenses (current) and other liabilities (non-current).

  Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases at
September 30, 2016 are as follows:      
     Data Center Agreements    
 The Company has agreements with various vendors to provide specialized space and services for the Company to host its software application.
Future minimum payments under non-cancelable data center agreements at September 30, 2016 totaled $2,099 of which $459, $1,574 and $66 is due in the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.  
   Purchase Commitments      As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had non-cancelable purchase commitments related to telecommunications, subscription fees for third-party data (such as Internet maps and posted speed limits) and subscription fees for software services totaling
$5,198, of which $882, $3,346, $951 and $19 will become payable in the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.  
   Indemnification Agreements      In the
ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of
breach of agreements, from services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its Board of Directors
and certain of its officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future
payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company does not believe that the
outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated
financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      Litigation    
 From time to time, the Company may become subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
In addition, the Company may receive notification alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights. Except as noted below, the Company is not a party to any material legal proceedings nor is the Company aware of any pending or
threatened litigation that, in its opinion, would have a material adverse effect on its business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows should such litigation be resolved unfavorably. The Company accrues
contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.  
 On October 27, 2015, Orthosie Systems, LLC filed a complaint against the Company (Orthosie Systems, LLC v. Fleetmatics USA, LLC
 et al. , Civil Action No. 2:15-cv-1681) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,430,471 entitled  Method and System for Monitoring a Vehicle.  The
complaint seeks unspecified damages and an injunction. On March 9, 2016, the Company filed its answer to the complaint and asserted counterclaims of noninfringement and invalidity. The parties have exchanged proposed claim constructions and a
Markman hearing is currently scheduled for December 14, 2016. At this stage of the litigation, the Company is unable to estimate whether a loss is reasonably possible. While the Company does not believe that this litigation will have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows, the Company cannot be assured that this will be the case.

  On August 30, 2016, Rothschild Digital Confirmation, LLC filed a complaint against the
Company (Rothschild Digital Confirmation, LLC v. Fleetmatics USA, LLC  et al.,  Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-00968) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of claims 1 and 27 of U.S. Patent
No. 7,456,872 ( the  872 patent ) entitled  Device and Method of Embedding and Retrieving Information in Digital Images.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages and an injunction. On October 4, 2016, Rothschild
Digital Confirmation filed an amended complaint withdrawing claim 27 and asserting infringement of claim 1 only. The Company s answer or response to the amended complaint is due on December 9, 2016. At this stage of the litigation, the
Company is unable to estimate whether a loss is reasonably possible. While the Company does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows, the Company
cannot be assured that this will be the case.    On January 12, 2016, David Gillard and Jaclyn Stramiello, individually and on behalf
of all others similarly situated, filed a complaint against the Company (Gillard  et al.  v. Fleetmatics USA, LLC,  et al.,  Civil Action No. 8:16-cv-81-T-27MAP) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida
alleging the Company s U.S. subsidiaries violated certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the  FLSA ) by failing to pay overtime, among other things. On February 8, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,
which added another named party plaintiff, Troy Pate. On February 10, 2016 the Court struck the amended complaint and the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on February 12, 2016. The second amended complaint alleges
essentially the same claims as previously alleged. The plaintiffs sought certification of the matter as a collective action under the FLSA. The FLSA permits an aggrieved person to recover as damages back pay, an equal amount of money as liquidated
damages, interest and attorneys  fees and costs. The Company filed its answer to the second amended complaint on March 11, 2016. On August 16, 2016, the parties executed a settlement agreement providing for an aggregate settlement
amount of $2,102,250 consisting of the payment of $1,559,188 in back pay and liquidated damages to members of the class of business development representatives, or web sales representatives, in the Company s U.S. offices, $17,500 in incentive
fees for the named plaintiffs and one of the opt-in plaintiffs, and the Company s agreement not to object to attorneys  fees up to $525,562. The settlement agreement was subject to Court approval. On August 19, 2016, the parties filed
a joint motion for Court approval of the settlement agreement and class certification. The Court denied the motion to approve the settlement agreement without prejudice, requested the removal of certain confidentiality provisions, and reserved
ruling on the remainder of the motion pending the submission of the amended settlement agreement. On September 29, 2016, the parties jointly filed the amended settlement agreement for the same aggregate amount as set out in the August 16,
2016 settlement agreement and renewed their motion for approval. On November 4, 2016, the Court granted final approval of the settlement agreement, conditionally certified the matter as a collective action for purposes of settlement and
dismissed the case with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company must appoint an administrator for payout of claims to class members, and any amounts unclaimed by the class members at the end of the payout period
provided in the settlement agreement will revert to the Company.     15. Subsequent Events   
 On July 30, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the  Transaction Agreement ) to be acquired by Verizon for
$60.00 per ordinary share in cash (the  Acquisition ). The Acquisition was approved by the shareholders of the Company at a Court Meeting of shareholders of the Company and at an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders of the
Company, each held on October 12, 2016. The Acquisition was subsequently sanctioned by the High Court of Ireland at a Court Hearing held on November 4, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, at the effective time of the
scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act of 2014 and in accordance with the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules 2013, as amended, all of the issued share capital of the Company will be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive the cash payments provided for pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement. Following completion of the Acquisition, the Company s ordinary shares will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and will no longer trade publicly. A description of the Transaction Agreement is contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 1, 2016, and a copy of the Transaction Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to such
report and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 to this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.

among the Company, Verizon Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Verizon ), and Verizon Business International Holdings B.V., a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Verizon ( Bidco ), in connection with a proposed acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the Company, whereby Bidco will acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital of the Company not already owned
by Verizon or its subsidiaries for cash by means of a scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act of 2014 and in accordance with the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules2013, as amended. In accordance with the

service businesses globally to leverage the prevalence of wireless data and mobile devices and giving them tools they need to automate, manage, simplify and improve their operations. We believe that our field service management solution,
particularly among SMBs where they are replacing manual processes that are often prone to inefficiency and errors, will help our customers improve customer service levels, increase mobile productivity and enhance savings.

  In April 2014, we released a software platform and launched three new product offerings:
Fleetmatics REVEAL, a business-intelligence based fleet management solution for SMBs; Fleetmatics REVEAL+, which extends the applicability of Fleetmatics REVEAL to larger enterprises; and Fleetmatics WORK, a field service management solution. This
software platform is an analytics-based, extensible foundation to deliver solutions, features, insights and applications that optimize how a mobile workforce gets work done and how a business manages its mobile assets. The three products that fall
under the software platform offer a solution for fleet management and field service management and are designed to help businesses maximize their return on fleet and mobile workforce investments.  
 In May 2014, we acquired Florence, Italy-based KKT S.r.l. ( KKT ), the privately-held developer of Routist, a SaaS-based,
intelligent vehicle routing solution for businesses looking to optimize the utilization of their fleets and mobile resources. Via its sophisticated algorithms, Routist provides optimized route plans for vehicles making multiple stops daily, and
provides opportunities for companies to achieve significant cost savings by helping to reduce miles driven, fuel consumption, and vehicle maintenance costs. Routist s complex and flexible optimization engine is able to take into
consideration locations, vehicles, time windows, technician skills, costs and capacities, among other inputs, while remaining simple and intuitive for customers to use.  
 In February 2015, we acquired Grenoble, France-based Ornicar SAS ( Ornicar ), a SaaS-based provider of fleet management solutions.
Ornicar added approximately 15,000 vehicles under subscription to Fleetmatics  existing installed base. This acquisition is consistent with our global growth strategy to further expand into mainland Europe and to acquire additional
customers in new territories. The acquisition of Ornicar and the French market expertise of the Ornicar team accelerated our presence and brand in a country that we believe offers us one of the largest market opportunities in Europe.  
 In November 2015, we acquired Ferrara, Italy-based Visirun S.p.A. ( Visirun ), a SaaS-based provider of fleet management solutions.
Visirun added approximately 30,000 vehicles under subscription to our existing installed base and added more than 3,000 customers. We believe that the acquisition of Visirun helps us to scale our European subscriber base while also bringing us
important Italian market expertise.    On July 30, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the  Transaction
Agreement ) to be acquired by Verizon for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash (the  Acquisition ). The Acquisition was approved by our shareholders at a Court Meeting of shareholders of Fleetmatics and at an Extraordinary General
Meeting of shareholders of Fleetmatics, each held on October 12, 2016. The Acquisition was subsequently sanctioned by the High Court of Ireland at a Court Hearing held on November 4, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction
Agreement, at the effective time of the scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act of 2014 and in accordance with the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules 2013, as amended, all of our share capital will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the cash payments provided for pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement. Following completion of the transaction, our ordinary shares will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and will no longer trade publicly. A description of the Transaction Agreement is contained in our Current Report on  Form 8-K  filed with the SEC on August 1, 2016, and a copy of the
Transaction Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to such report and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 to this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.   
 In September 2016, we acquired Lisbon, Portugal-based Inosat   Consultoria Inform tica, S.A. ( Inosat ), a SaaS-based
provider of fleet management solutions. Inosat added approximately 50,000 vehicles under subscription to Fleetmatics  existing installed base. This acquisition is consistent with our global growth strategy to further expand into mainland Europe
and to acquire additional customers in new territories.    We derive substantially all of our revenues from subscription agreements to our
solutions, which typically include the use of our  SaaS-based  fleet management solution and an in-vehicle device or simply a SaaS-based solution for our field service-only customers. We generate sales through
lead-generating Web-based advertising and targeted outbound sales efforts, which we then work to convert into paying customers. Our in-vehicle devices associated with our fleet management offering are installed by our network of installation
partners. Initial customer contracts are typically 36 months in duration for fleet management customers and 12 months in duration for field service management customers, both of which renew automatically for one or three-year periods
thereafter, unless the customer elects not to renew. These contract terms provide us with a high degree of visibility into future revenue. Our customer contracts are non-cancelable, and our customers generally are billed on a monthly basis.

  We have achieved significant revenue growth historically. Our growth has been driven through a
combination of selling to new customers, selling additional vehicle subscriptions to existing customers, as their number of vehicles under management increases, as well as selling additional features of our fleet management applications to our
existing customers. Our customer acquisition model is designed to be efficient and scalable by focusing on acquiring large volumes of leads primarily through Web-based sales and marketing efforts. Through these efforts, we have successfully driven
strong growth in sales among a relatively diverse and distributed SMB customer base. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our largest customer accounted for approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, of our subscription revenue and
our top 25 customers represented approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, of our subscription revenue.    As we pursue our growth strategy,
we will have many opportunities and challenges. One of our key initiatives is to continue to expand our business internationally and we expect to continue to hire additional personnel as we pursue this continued expansion. We may also continue
to complete strategic acquisitions to help us expand our sales and operations internationally. We will have to address additional risks as we pursue this international expansion, including the difficulties of localizing our solutions, competing with
local companies as well as the challenge of managing and staffing international operations. We also intend to explore opportunities to capitalize on the data we accumulate from our customers  vehicles as we seek ways to monetize this valuable
information. Over time, we may experience pressure on pricing as our products become more mature and as competition intensifies in various markets. Each of our strategic initiatives will require expenditure of capital and management focus and
we may be unsuccessful as we execute our strategy.    In each quarter since our inception, we have increased our number of customers and the
number of vehicles subscribed to our solutions. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 826,000 vehicles under subscription, an increase of 26.1% from approximately 655,000 as of September 30, 2015. Our subscription revenue in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 grew 17.2% to $243.2 million compared to $207.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As the business has grown, we have leveraged our scale to negotiate improved pricing associated with
application hosting, procurement of in-vehicle devices, telecommunication services and third-party data subscription services. We reported net income of $8.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $26.0
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below under Key Financial and Operating Metrics) in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 grew 14.6% to $77.0 million compared to $67.2
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     Key Financial and Operating Metrics   
 In addition to traditional financial metrics, we monitor the ongoing operation of our business using a number of financially and  non-financially  derived metrics that are not included in our consolidated financial statements.      
    Total vehicles under subscription.  This metric represents the number of vehicles managed by our
customers utilizing one or more of our fleet management SaaS solutions at the end of the period. Since our revenue is primarily driven by the number of vehicles that subscribe to our SaaS solutions, we believe that the number of total fleet
management vehicles under subscription is an important metric to monitor. This number excludes any subscriptions associated with the Fleetmatics field service management solution.  
  Adjusted EBITDA.  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest (income)
expense, net, foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized in-vehicle-devices owned by customers, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation,
certain litigation and settlement costs, acquisition-related transaction costs and loss on extinguishment of debt.    We have included
Adjusted EBITDA in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our core
operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans; and to allocate resources to expand our business. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating
Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors in connection with the payment of
bonuses to our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.
 
      21  

Table of Contents  

  Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered
in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:      

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements
for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debt or any losses on the extinguishment of our debt;    

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the costs of certain litigation and settlement payments;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related transaction costs;        

Adjusted EBITDA does not include foreign currency transaction gains and losses; and        

other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.    
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow
metrics, net income and our other GAAP results. The following unaudited table presents a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:      
    Components of Results of Operations   
   Subscription Revenue      We derive
substantially all of our revenue from subscription fees for our solutions, which predominately include the use of our SaaS-based fleet management solution and an in-vehicle device. Our revenue is driven primarily by the number of vehicles under
subscription, or number of subscriptions in the case of our field service management offering, and the price per subscription. In addition, we generate revenue by selling our customers additional features, such as our fuel card integration,
driving style option, and integration with Global Positioning System, or GPS, navigation devices. We also generate revenue by selling aggregated, anonymous data to third parties.  
 Our contract terms generally are 36 months in duration for fleet management customers and 12 months in duration for field service management
customers for their initial term, both of which renew automatically for one or three-year periods thereafter, unless the customer elects not to renew. We collect fees from our customers for a ratable portion of the contract on a periodic basis,
generally on a monthly basis in advance. Our payment terms are typically monthly; however, we continue to enable certain of our customers to prepay all or part of their contractual obligations quarterly, annually or for the full contract term in
exchange for a modest prepayment discount that is reflected in the pricing of the contract.

    Cost of Subscription Revenue    
 Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to communications, third-party data and hosting costs (which include the cost
of telecommunications charges for data; subscription fees paid to third-party providers of Internet maps; posted speed limit, local address and other data; and costs of hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings);
third-party costs related to the maintenance and repair of installed in-vehicle devices, which we refer to as field service costs; depreciation of  in-vehicle  devices (including installation and shipping costs
related to these devices); amortization of capitalized in-vehicle devices owned by customers; personnel costs (including share-based compensation) of our customer support activities and related to configuration of our solutions to interface with the
customers  workflow or other internal systems where necessary; amortization expense for internal-use capitalized software costs; amortization of developed technology acquired as part of our acquisition of Inosat in September 2016, Visirun in
November 2015, Ornicar in February 2015, KKT in May 2014, and Connect2Field in August 2013; amortization of the patent for our vehicle tracking system; and an allocation of occupancy and general office related expenses, such as rent and utilities,
based on headcount. We allocate a portion of customer support costs related to assisting in the sales process to sales and marketing expense.  
 We capitalize the cost of installed in-vehicle devices (including installation and shipping costs related to these devices) and depreciate
these costs over the minimum estimated useful life of the devices or over the estimated average customer relationship period, which are both currently six years. If a customer subscription agreement is canceled or expires prior to the end of the
expected useful life of the device under contract, the depreciation period is accelerated resulting in the carrying value being expensed in the then-current period. Furthermore, as a result of the decommissioning of its 2G network by one of our
primary network providers, we are incurring additional costs as we migrate customers from in-vehicle devices that support 2G networks to in-vehicle devices that support 3G networks. We expect to have the customer migration completed by the end of
2016.    The expenses related to our hosted software applications are only modestly affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our
products because of the scalability of our software applications, data expansion and hosting infrastructure. However, many of the other components of our cost of subscription revenue, such as depreciation of in-vehicle devices and installation and
shipping costs related to these devices, communications expense and subscription fees paid to our Internet map providers and for other  third-party  data are variable costs affected by the number of vehicles
subscribed by customers.    We expect that the cost of subscription revenue in absolute dollars will increase in the future depending on the
growth rate of subscription sales to new and existing customers and our resulting need to service and support those customers. We also expect that cost of subscription revenue as a percentage of subscription revenue will fluctuate from period to
period as certain expense components are not expected to increase linearly with revenue.      Sales and Marketing    
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits (including share-based compensation) for sales and marketing personnel,
including the amortization of deferred commissions and travel related expenses; advertising and promotional costs; and an allocation of occupancy and general office related expenses, such as rent and utilities, based on headcount. Also included in
our sales and marketing expenses is the amortization of the value of customer relationships and trademarks acquired as part of our SageQuest acquisition in 2010, Ornicar in February 2015, Visirun in November 2015, and Inosat in September 2016.
Advertising costs consist primarily of pay-per-click advertising with search engines, other online and offline advertising media, as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. We
capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of new customer contracts with a term of greater than one year. For the majority of our customer contracts, we pay commissions in full when we receive the
initial customer contract for a new subscription or a renewal subscription. For all other customer contracts, we pay commissions in full when we receive the initial customer payment for a new subscription or a renewal subscription. Commission costs
are capitalized upon payment and are amortized as expense ratably over the term of the related non-cancelable customer contract, in proportion to the recognition of the subscription revenue. If a subscription agreement is terminated, the unamortized
portion of any deferred commission cost is recognized as an expense immediately.    We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in
order to drive growth in our sales and continue to build brand and category awareness. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to continue to be our largest operating expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage
of subscription revenue, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of subscription revenue.

Table of Contents  

    Research and Development    
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits (including share-based compensation) for product management and
development personnel, costs of external consultants, and, to a lesser extent, an allocation of occupancy and general office related expenses, such as rent and utilities, based on headcount. We have focused our research and development efforts on
improving ease of use, functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as on expanding and developing new offerings. The majority of our research and development employees are located in our development center in
Ireland. Therefore, a majority of research and development expense is subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal-use software development costs that qualify
for capitalization, such as costs related to software enhancements that add functionality, which are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life.  
 We believe that continued investment in our technology is important for our future growth, and as a result, we expect research and development
expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of subscription revenue.      General and Administrative
     General and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits (including share-based compensation) for
administrative services, human resources, internal information technology support, executive, legal, finance and accounting personnel; professional fees; expenses for business application software licenses; non-income related taxes; other corporate
expenses, such as insurance; credit card and banking fees; bad debt expenses; and an allocation of occupancy and general office related expenses, such as rent and utilities, based on headcount.  
 We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of
our business.      Interest Income (Expense), net    
 Interest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding debt as well as on our capital lease obligations.  
   Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss), net    
 Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net consists primarily of the net unrealized gains and losses recognized upon revaluing the foreign
currency-denominated intercompany payables and receivables of our various subsidiaries at each balance sheet date. To a lesser extent, foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net also consists of the transaction gains and losses recorded
to revalue the foreign currency-denominated customer accounts receivable and vendor payables recorded by our subsidiaries that transact in currencies other than their functional currency. We currently do not engage in hedging activities related
to our foreign currency-denominated intercompany balances or our customer receivables and other payables; as such, we cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our operating results. See
 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       Provision for Income Taxes    
 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of taxes in Ireland, the United States and the United Kingdom. There are two
main drivers of our annual effective tax rate. First, as a multi-national company, we are subject to tax in various jurisdictions which apply various statutory rates of tax to our income. Each of these jurisdictions has its own tax law which is
subject to interpretation on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In Ireland, our operating entity is subject to tax at a 12.5% tax rate and our  non-operating  entities are subject to tax at a 25% or 0% tax
rate, while our foreign subsidiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom are subject to tax rates of approximately 39% and 20%, respectively. Second, as a result of our global business model, we engage in a significant number of cross-border
intercompany transactions. As a result of these transactions, we have recorded reserves for uncertain tax positions related to how the different jurisdictions may conclude on the tax treatment of the transaction and how we might settle those
exposures. There is no guarantee that how one jurisdiction might view a particular transaction will be respected by another jurisdiction. Additionally, there may be instances where our income is subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction.
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 Our unaudited interim financial statements and other financial information as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, as presented herein and in Item 1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, reflects no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as set forth in Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of

   Results of Operations   
 The following table presents our results of operations in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of subscription revenue for each of the
periods indicated (certain items may not foot due to rounding).      
    Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   Subscription Revenue        
   Subscription revenue increased by $9.7 million, or 13.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased $35.6 million, or 17.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This revenue growth was primarily
driven by the increase in the average number of vehicles under subscription, which grew by approximately 26.1% year-over-year. As of the period-ends, the number of vehicles under subscription increased from approximately 655,000 as of
September 30, 2015 to approximately 826,000 as of September 30, 2016. The increase in vehicles under subscription was due in large part to our investment in sales and marketing of our solutions, including the addition of 95 sales and
marketing personnel from period-end to period-end, as well as growth related to our international expansion activities.      Cost of Subscription
Revenue        
   Cost of subscription revenue increased by $2.7 million, or 14.6%, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in variable expenses resulting from an increase in the number of vehicles under subscription, which grew
approximately 26.1% period-end to period-end (inclusive of the costs associated with acquired in-vehicle devices from the Visirun acquisition in November 2015, and to a lesser extent, the Inosat acquisition in September 2016 and the Ornicar
acquisition in February 2015). Depreciation and amortization of installed in-vehicle  
      25  

Table of Contents  

devices increased by $1.1 million primarily due to the increase in the number of vehicles under subscription as well as additional costs incurred due to the migration of some of our
customers from 2G to 3G networks. Additionally, depreciation expense related to production equipment increased by $0.3 million. Payroll and related expenses, inclusive of share-based compensation expense, increased by $0.9 million primarily due
to an increase of 58 employees in our customer support and configuration groups. Amortization of internal-use software increased by $0.4 million as a result of increased capitalized costs period-over-period related to our internal-use software
applications accessed by our customers through our website.    Cost of subscription revenue increased by $10.5 million, or 19.6%, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in variable expenses resulting from an increase in the number of vehicles under subscription, which
grew approximately 26.1% period-end to period-end (inclusive of the costs associated with acquired in-vehicle devices from the Visirun acquisition in November 2015, and to a lesser extent, the Inosat acquisition in September 2016 and the Ornicar
acquisition in February 2015). Depreciation and amortization of installed in-vehicle devices increased by $3.6 million primarily due to the increase in the number of vehicles under subscription as well as additional costs incurred due to the
migration of some of our customers from 2G to 3G networks. Additionally, depreciation expense related to production equipment increased by $1.0 million. Field service costs for maintenance and repair of installed in-vehicle devices increased by
$2.1 million primarily due to the increase in the number of vehicles under subscription. Payroll and related expenses, inclusive of share-based compensation expense, increased by $2.4 million primarily due to an increase of 58 employees in our
customer support and configuration groups. Amortization of internal-use software increased by $1.3 million as a result of increased capitalized costs period-over-period related to our internal-use software applications accessed by our customers
through our website. Amortization of acquired developed technology increased by $0.1 million primarily due to amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the Visirun acquisition. Acquired developed technology is amortized over its
estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years, based on the pattern over which we expect to consume the economic benefit of each asset which in general reflects the expected cash flows from each asset.  
 As a percentage of subscription revenue, our cost of subscription revenue increased from 25.6% in the three months ended September 30,
2015 to 25.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased from 25.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 26.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We continue to negotiate improved pricing for our
subscriber-based costs, such as the cost of in-vehicle devices, data communication charges and third-party data subscription fees, including those for mapping and posted speed limit data and have achieved improved economies of scale from our hosting
activities and configuration personnel as these components of our costs result in minimal incremental cost per vehicle under subscription. However, these efficiencies were offset by implementation costs related to our field service management
application, an increase in amortization expense associated with investment in our internal-use software, an increase in fleet management costs due to the increase in the number of vehicles under subscription and, to a lesser extent,
accelerated costs due to terminated subscriptions.      Sales and Marketing Expense    
   
   Sales and marketing expense increased $5.9 million, or 23.8%, for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts into international markets, including the addition of sales and marketing personnel from the
Ornicar, Visirun and Inosat acquisitions, the expansion of dedicated sales teams to support our field service management application, and our continued investment in building brand and category awareness in our market to drive customer adoption of
our solutions. We incurred increased payroll-related costs, inclusive of commissions and share-based compensation expense, of $4.9 million, primarily related to the expansion of our sales and marketing teams. These increases were the result of an
increase of 95 sales and marketing personnel from period-end to period-end added to further pursue the continued sales growth strategy of our business. We also increased the number of our marketing personnel to focus on lead generation, brand
awareness and search engine optimization. Advertising and promotional expenditures increased by $0.5 million due to additional marketing and advertising efforts. Amortization expense increased by $0.5 million related to customer relationships and
trademarks acquired in the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions. Customer relationships and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to nine years, based on the pattern over which we expect to consume the
economic benefit of each asset which in general reflects the expected cash flows from each asset.    Sales and marketing expense increased
$16.7 million, or 23.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts into international markets,
including the addition of sales and marketing personnel from the Ornicar, Visirun and Inosat acquisitions, the expansion of dedicated sales teams to support our field service management application, and our continued investment in building

brand and category awareness in our market to drive customer adoption of our solutions. We incurred increased payroll-related costs, inclusive of commissions and share-based compensation expense,
of $13.0 million, and increased travel expense of $0.2 million, primarily related to the expansion of our sales and marketing teams. These increases were the result of an increase of 95 sales and marketing personnel from period-end to period-end
added to further pursue the continued sales growth strategy of our business. We also increased the number of our marketing personnel to focus on lead generation, brand awareness and search engine optimization. Advertising and promotional
expenditures increased by $1.5 million due to additional marketing and advertising efforts. Facilities expense increased by $0.8 million as a result of additional office space requirements related to our additional hiring efforts. Amortization
expense increased by $1.2 million related to customer relationships and trademarks acquired in the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions. Customer relationships and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to nine
years, based on the pattern over which we expect to consume the economic benefit of each asset which in general reflects the expected cash flows from each asset.  
 As a percentage of subscription revenue, sales and marketing expense increased from 33.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to
36.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased from 34.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 36.6%in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the increases in
payroll and related expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures period-over-period as noted above. Other cost increases in sales and marketing expense were in line with the percentage growth in subscription revenue period-over-period.
     Research and Development Expense        
   Research and development expense increased $2.2 million, or 38.5%, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional payroll-related costs, inclusive of share-based compensation, of $1.7 million, travel expense of $0.1 million and
facilities expense of $0.3 million, all incurred related to an additional 61 employees hired (inclusive of research and development personnel from the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions), as well as $0.1 million of consulting costs to further enhance
and develop our products.    Research and development expense increased $6.6 million, or 42.8%, for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional payroll-related costs, inclusive of share-based compensation, of $5.3 million, travel expense of $0.2 million and facilities expense of
$0.8 million, all incurred related to an additional 61 employees hired (inclusive of research and development personnel from the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions), as well as $0.3 million of consulting costs to further enhance and develop our
products.    Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $7.9 million and $5.7 million,
respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $22.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively, was recorded net after capitalization of $1.7 million, $1.2 million, $4.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of costs
related to our internal-use software applications accessed by our customers through our website.    As a percentage of subscription revenue,
research and development expense, net of capitalized costs related to our internal-use software applications, increased from 7.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 9.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and
increased from 7.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 9.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily due to the increases in payroll and related expenses period-over-period as noted above.
     General and Administrative Expense        
   General and administrative expense increased $7.7 million, or 53.1%, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million in professional fees related to acquisition-related transaction costs. Also contributing to the
increase in general and administrative expense period-over-period was an increase of $2.4 million in payroll-related costs, inclusive of share-based compensation, and $0.1 million of travel expenses primarily the result of an increase of
45 general and administrative personnel period-over-period (inclusive of general and administrative personnel from the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions) in order to support the growth in the business. Also contributing to the increase in general and
administrative expense period-over-period was an increase of $0.1 million in merchant and bank fees.

  General and administrative expense increased $17.8 million, or 45.7%, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million in professional fees related to acquisition-related transaction costs as well as an increase of $3.4
million in professional fees related to legal fees and settlement costs for certain legal matters (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further details about litigation). Also contributing to the increase in general and
administrative expense period-over-period was an increase of $7.0 million in payroll-related costs, inclusive of share-based compensation, $0.1 million of travel expenses, and $0.4 million of facilities expenses primarily the result of an
increase of 45 general and administrative personnel period-over-period (inclusive of general and administrative personnel from the Inosat and Visirun acquisitions) in order to support the growth in the business. Bad debt expense increased $1.5
million due to the increase in the number of customers and their related accounts receivable balances period-over-period. Also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expense period-over-period was an increase of $0.3 million
in merchant and bank fees.    As a percentage of subscription revenue, general and administrative expense increased from 19.7% in the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to 26.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased from 18.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 23.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were
primarily due to the increases in professional fees related to acquisition-related transaction costs, settlement costs and legal fees, payroll and related expenses and bad debt expense period-over-period as noted above.  
   Interest Income (Expense), net        
   Interest income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $46 thousand, or
25.1%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased $18 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 2.7%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and primarily reflects the
interest expense incurred on our long-term debt and capital leases as well as amortization expense of related debt discounts and deferred financing costs. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our existing
credit facility with Citibank, N.A., or the Credit Facility. Interest income netted against interest expense was immaterial in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss), net        
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $0.7 million in foreign currency transaction
losses as compared to $1.1 million in foreign currency transaction losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $3.1 million in foreign currency transaction losses as
compared to $2.0 million in foreign currency transaction gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net primarily reflects the foreign currency transaction gains or losses arising from exchange
rate fluctuations on certain asset balances and intercompany payables and receivables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the legal entities in which the transactions are recorded. Foreign currency transaction gains
(losses) arise from fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling, and to a lesser extent the Australian Dollar. The $3.1 million foreign
currency transaction losses recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily the result of the movement in the Euro which strengthened by approximately 2% compared to the U.S. Dollar. The $2.0 million foreign currency
transaction gain recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily the result of the movement in the Euro which weakened by approximately 8% compared to the U.S. Dollar.

    Loss on Extinguishment of Debt    
 In January 2015, we used the $23.8 million in net proceeds from the borrowings under the Credit Facility with Citibank, N.A. to pay in full the
amounts due under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC. The repayment of the Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC debt was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million, which was primarily comprised of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.  
   Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes        
   Our provision for (benefit from) for income taxes consists primarily of taxes in Ireland, the United States
and the United Kingdom. We are subject to tax in various jurisdictions that apply various statutory rates of tax to our income. Each of these jurisdictions has its own tax law, which is subject to interpretation on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction
basis. In Ireland, our operating entity is subject to tax at a 12.5% tax rate on its trading income and 25% on its non-trading income and our non-operating entities are subject to tax at a 25% or 0% tax rate, while our foreign subsidiaries in the
United States and the United Kingdom are subject to tax rates of approximately 39% and 20%, respectively.    Our effective income tax rate
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was (2056.8)% and (12.1)%, respectively, on pre-tax income (loss) of $(37) thousand and $7,235, respectively. The effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2016 was lower
than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the net loss in the period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the release of reserves
related to uncertain tax positions upon the expiration of a statute of limitation in Ireland, income being generated in a jurisdiction that has a lower tax rate than the Irish statutory rate and the Irish research and development tax credit.  
 Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was (4.4)% and 7.9%, respectively, on pre-tax income
of $8.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was lower than the statutory Irish rate of 12.5% primarily due to the release of various historical uncertain tax
positions including interest and penalties in the third quarter and by research and development tax credits in Ireland. These decreases were partially offset by the recording of uncertain tax positions. The Company made a change to its
organizational structure in the fourth quarter of 2014 that impacted the jurisdictional mix of profits and was beneficial to our income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources       
     Operating Activities    
 Operating activities provided $71.6 million and $69.1 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The cash flow provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from our net income of $8.1 million, net non-cash charges of $75.6 million, and net uses of cash of $12.1 million provided by changes
in our operating assets and liabilities. Our non-cash charges primarily consisted of $40.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $27.6 million of share-based compensation expense, $3.9 million of provisions for accounts receivable
allowances, $2.6 million for losses on disposal of property and equipment and other assets, $3.1 million of unrealized foreign currency transaction losses, and $1.6 million in excess tax benefits from share-based awards. Net uses of cash from
changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $4.9 million increase in our accounts receivable from customers and a $10.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and  
      29  

Table of Contents  

other assets, a $2.4 million decrease in accrued income taxes, and a $3.9 million decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses
and other current liabilities. The increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted from our increased spending due to the growth of our business. The decrease in our accrued taxes was due to net decreases in our tax reserves. The
increase in our accounts receivable was due to the increase in subscription revenue resulting from the increased number of vehicles under subscription. The increase in our prepaid expenses and other assets was due to increases in deferred commission
payments and additional prepaid software licenses purchased during the quarter.    Operating activities provided $69.1 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The cash flow provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from our net income of $26.0 million, net non-cash charges of $53.9 million, and net uses of
cash of $10.8 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our non-cash charges primarily consisted of $30.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $17.0 million of share-based compensation expense, $2.5 million of
provisions for accounts receivable allowances, $2.2 million for losses on disposal of property and equipment and other assets, $0.1 million for losses on extinguishment of debt, $2.2 million of unrealized foreign currency transaction gains, and
$3.6 million of changes in excess tax benefits from share-based awards. Net uses of cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $5.5 million increase in our accounts receivable from customers, a $9.6 million
increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $1.2 million decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and a $0.4 million increase in accrued
income taxes. The increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted from our increased spending due to the growth of our business. The increase in our accrued taxes was due to net increases in our tax reserves. The increase in our
accounts receivable was due to the increase in subscription revenue resulting from the increased number of vehicles under subscription. The increase in our prepaid expenses and other assets was due to increases in deferred commission payments and
additional prepaid software licenses purchased during the period. The decrease in deferred revenue reflects fewer customers prepaying for a portion of their subscription as well as the completion of installations during the period.  
   Investing Activities      Net cash
used in investing activities was $53.5 million and $43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cashed used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid of $21.3 million to acquire Inosat as
well as working capital adjustments pursuant to the Visirun and Ornicar purchase and sale agreements of $0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash paid to acquire Ornicar of $7.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $26.4 million and $32.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as
well as costs capitalized for internal-use software of $5.1 million and $3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   Financing Activities      Net cash
used in financing activities was $35.0 million and $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of payments of borrowings
under the Credit Facility of $23.8 million, payments of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $11.6 million, payments of our capital lease obligations of $1.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of ordinary
shares under stock option plans of $0.4 million and from excess tax benefits from share-based awards of $1.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of payments of borrowings under
the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of $23.8 million, payments of borrowings under Credit Facility of $23.8 million, the payments of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $6.6 million, changes in excess tax benefits
from share-based awards of $3.6 million, payments of our capital lease obligations of $1.0 million, and payments of notes payable of $0.4 million, partially offset by net proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Facility of $46.1 million and
proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under stock option plans of $2.4 million.      Indebtedness and Liquidity    
 We believe that our cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the Credit Facility.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We do not
engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities.

   Contractual Obligations and Commitments   
 Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities, leases for our building, office space, computer
equipment, furniture and fixtures, and contractual commitments for hosting and other support services. We have a lease for 42,912 square feet of office space in Waltham, Massachusetts for our U.S. headquarters which is effective through October
2020. We lease approximately 31,200 square feet of office and warehouse space in Ohio under operating leases that expire in November 2017 with a five-year extension option. We lease 31,641 square feet of office space in Ireland for our registered
office and for our research and development and sales teams under operating leases that expire in July 2019. We have a lease for 2,200 square feet of office space in Templeogue Village, Dublin, which expires in 2036. We lease office space in Rolling

mortgage for our office building in Ferrara, Italy which we use primarily for our sales, marketing and customer support organizations in Italy.  
 We have non-cancelable purchase commitments related to telecommunications, mapping and subscription software services that are payable through
2019.    We have agreements with various vendors to provide specialized space and equipment and related services from which we host our
software application. The agreements include payment commitments that expire at various dates through 2018.    The following table
summarizes our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016:      

(1) 
 Represents the outstanding borrowings and contractually required unused line fees and service fees contractually required under our Credit Facility in existence at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016,
we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       We face exposure to adverse
movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. Portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro, the British
Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar, and the Australian Dollar with respect to revenues, expenses and intercompany payables and receivables. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve.  
   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk    
 Foreign currency transaction exposure results primarily from intercompany transactions and transactions with customers or vendors denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded by us. Assets and liabilities arising from such transactions are translated into the legal entity s functional currency using the exchange
rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss resulting from currency fluctuations is recorded on a separate line in our consolidated statements of operations. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $3.1 million were recorded
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net foreign currency transaction gains of $2.0 million were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Foreign currency translation exposure results from the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries whose functional currency
is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. The balance sheets of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates and their income statements are translated into U.S. Dollars
using the average exchange rate over the period. Resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. Net foreign currency translation gains of $2.8 million were
recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net foreign currency translation losses of $3.8 million were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 As we pursue our growth strategy, which includes expanding our business internationally, more of our revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities will be subject to foreign currency translation into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 13.9% of our revenues and approximately 25.5% of our operating
expenses were generated by subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar and therefore are subject to foreign currency translation exposure. In addition, 29.4% of our assets and 33.1% of our liabilities were subject to foreign
currency translation exposure as of September 30, 2016 as compared to 21.5% of our assets and 20.2% of our liabilities as of December 31, 2015.  
 Currently, our largest foreign currency exposures are those with respect to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, and the Australian
Dollar. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at September 30, 2016, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would expose us to losses in earnings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we estimated
that a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased pre-tax income by $7.6 million. The estimates used assume that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time. The potential change noted above
is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of September 30, 2016. We have experienced and we will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of revaluing our assets and liabilities
that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that recorded the asset or liability. At this time, we do not hedge our foreign currency risk.  
   Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk      As
we only hold cash, our cash balances are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates with respect to our Credit Facility which bears interest at variable rates (based on
our discretion) plus an applicable margin based on certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.  
   Inflation Risk      We do not believe
that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may
not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting     No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
 Rules 13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)  under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       From time to time, the Company may become subject to legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company may receive notification alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights. Except as noted below, the Company is not a
party to any material legal proceedings nor is the Company aware of any pending or threatened litigation that, in its opinion, would have a material adverse effect on its business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows should such litigation be resolved unfavorably. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.  
 On October 27, 2015, Orthosie Systems, LLC filed a complaint against the Company (Orthosie Systems, LLC v. Fleetmatics USA, LLC  et
al. , Civil Action No. 2:15-cv-1681) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,430,471 entitled  Method and System for Monitoring a Vehicle.  The complaint
seeks unspecified damages and an injunction. On March 9, 2016, the Company filed its answer to the complaint and asserted counterclaims of noninfringement and invalidity. The parties have exchanged proposed claim constructions and a Markman
hearing is currently scheduled for December 14, 2016. At this stage of the litigation, the Company is unable to estimate whether a loss is reasonably possible. While the Company does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows, the Company cannot be assured that this will be the case.  
 On August 30, 2016, Rothschild Digital Confirmation, LLC filed a complaint against the Company (Rothschild Digital Confirmation, LLC v.
Fleetmatics USA, LLC  et al.,  Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-00968) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of claims 1 and 27 of U.S. Patent No. 7,456,872 ( the  872
patent ) entitled  Device and Method of Embedding and Retrieving Information in Digital Images.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages and an injunction. On October 4, 2016, Rothschild Digital Confirmation filed an amended
complaint withdrawing claim 27 and asserting infringement of claim 1 only. The Company s answer or response to the amended complaint is due on December 9, 2016. At this stage of the litigation, the Company is unable to estimate whether a
loss is reasonably possible. While the Company does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows, the Company cannot be assured that this will be the
case.    On January 12, 2016, David Gillard and Jaclyn Stramiello, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a
complaint against the Company (Gillard  et al.  v. Fleetmatics USA, LLC,  et al.,  Civil Action No. 8:16-cv-81-T-27MAP) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging the Company s U.S.
subsidiaries violated certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the  FLSA ) by failing to pay overtime, among other things. On February 8, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added another named party
plaintiff, Troy Pate. On February 10, 2016 the Court struck the amended complaint and the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on February 12, 2016. The second amended complaint alleges essentially the same claims as previously
alleged. The plaintiffs sought certification of the matter as a collective action under the FLSA. The FLSA permits an aggrieved person to recover as damages back pay, an equal amount of money as liquidated damages, interest and attorneys  fees
and costs. The Company filed its answer to the second amended complaint on March 11, 2016. On August 16, 2016, the parties executed a settlement agreement providing for an aggregate settlement amount of $2,102,250 consisting of the payment
of $1,559,188 in back pay and liquidated damages to members of the class of business development representatives, or web sales representatives, in the Company s U.S. offices, $17,500 in incentive fees for the named plaintiffs and one of the
opt-in plaintiffs, and the Company s agreement not to object to attorneys  fees up to $525,562. The settlement agreement was subject to Court approval. On August 19, 2016, the parties filed a joint motion for Court approval of the
settlement agreement and class certification. The Court denied the motion to approve the settlement agreement without prejudice, requested the removal of certain confidentiality provisions, and reserved ruling on the remainder of the motion pending
the submission of the amended settlement agreement. On September 29, 2016, the parties jointly filed the amended settlement agreement for the same aggregate amount as set out in the August 16, 2016 settlement agreement and renewed their
motion for approval. On November 4, 2016, the Court granted final approval of the settlement agreement, conditionally certified the matter as a collective action for purposes of settlement and dismissed the case with prejudice. Pursuant to the
terms of the settlement agreement, the Company must appoint an administrator for payout of claims to class members, and any amounts unclaimed by the class members at the end of the payout period provided in the settlement agreement will revert to
the Company.

  Risk Factors       The matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include
forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are based on various assumptions by management regarding future circumstances many of which Fleetmatics has little or no
control over. A number of important risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the caption  Risk Factors  in our Annual and subsequent filings as well as risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Except for the risk factor listed below, there were no material changes in our risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report.
     The results of the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions,
financial markets and our business.      The announcement in June 2016 of the referendum of the United Kingdom s membership of the
European Union (referred to as Brexit), advising for the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and
future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. While the referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last
at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with
respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum may also give rise to calls for the governments of other European
Union member states to consider withdrawal. The announcement of Brexit may cause significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.

   Premises  : Suite 300 located on the third floor in the Corporate Center Two at International Plaza building (the   Building  ) located on land with an address of 4211 West Boy Scout
Blvd., Tampa, Florida 33607 (the   Land  )        

(e) 
     Pro-rata Share  : Tenant s pro-rata share is 5.87%, which is determined by dividing the Rentable Area of Premises by the Rentable Area of Building.

   Term  : a period of approximately eighty-eight (88) months beginning on the Commencement Date and expiring at 6 o clock PM local time on the Expiration Date.    

(g) 
   Lease Year  : each successive twelve (12) month period throughout the Term; provided that the first Lease Year shall commence on the Commencement Date and expire (i) on the last day of the month
preceding the first anniversary of the Commencement Date, if the Commencement Date occurs on the first day of the month; or (ii) on the last day of the month in which the first anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs, if the Commencement Date
occurs on a day other than the first day of the month; each subsequent Lease Year shall commence on the day following the expiration of the previous Lease Year; and, the last Lease Year shall expire upon the expiration of the Term.

(h) 
   Commencement Date  : Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Commencement Date of this Lease shall be the earlier of (i) the date Tenant takes possession of all or any portion
of the Premises for the purpose of conducting Tenant s business; or (ii) Substantial Completion, as defined and provided in the Work Letter, defined below, as adjusted for Tenant Delay, as defined and provided in the Work Letter. The
Commencement Date is estimated to occur on or about December 1, 2016 (the   Estimated Commencement Date  ). The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve such Estimated Commencement Date.    

(i) 
   Expiration Date  : The last day of the eighty-eighth (88th) month following the Commencement Date.

assignment, the use of the Premises is changed from the Authorized Use or if the use of the Premises is otherwise changed from the Authorized Use. This Exclusive Use shall automatically terminate if Tenant is in Default under the terms and
conditions of this Lease.     4  .    Term  . This Lease shall constitute a legally binding and enforceable agreement

Buildings (Green Globes -CIEB), the U.S. Green Building Council s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, or other applicable standard, or to support achieving energy and carbon reduction targets, and all costs
of maintaining, managing, reporting, commissioning, and re-commissioning the Building or any part thereof that was designed and/or built to be sustainable and conform with the U.S. EPA s ENERGY
STAR    rating and/or Design to Earn ENERGY STAR, the Green Building Initiative s Green Globes  for Continual Improvement of Existing Buildings (Green Globes -CIEB), the U.S.
Green Building Council s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, or other applicable standard, provided however, the cost of such application, reporting and commissioning of the Building or any part thereof to seek
certification shall be a cost capitalized and thereafter amortized as an Operating Expense under GAAP. Except as specifically provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Operating Expenses shall not include the following: (i) depreciation, (ii)
leasing commissions, (iii) repairs and restorations paid for by the proceeds of any insurance policy, (iv) construction of improvements of a capital nature, (v) income and franchise taxes other than that portion, if any, of income and franchise

set forth in  Exhibit I  attached hereto.   Taxes ,  as used herein, means all ad valorem taxes, personal property taxes, and all other taxes, assessments, and all other similar charges, if any, which are levied, assessed, or
imposed upon or become due and payable in connection with, or a lien upon, the Project or any portion thereof or facilities used in connection therewith, and all taxes of whatsoever nature that are imposed in substitution for or in lieu of any of

all costs, expenses and fees associated or incurred by Landlord in connection with that inducement resolution and transaction involving a development authority; but excluding, however, taxes and assessments attributable to the personal property of
tenants and paid by such tenants as a separate charge, and all estate, inheritance, gift, transfer, excise, income and profit taxes, as well as special assessments. In the event Landlord shall retain any consultant to negotiate the amount of taxes,
tax rate, assessed value or other factors influencing the amount of Taxes, then the aggregate of all such reasonable third-party fees (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  and appraisers  fees) and all disbursements, court
costs and other items paid or incurred by Landlord during the applicable tax year with respect to such proceedings shall be included in Taxes. As of the Effective Date, the Building is fully assessed. Tenant shall not institute any proceedings with
respect to the assessed valuation of the Building, Project, or the Property or any part thereof for the purpose of seeking or securing a tax reduction. If a rental tax, gross receipts tax or sales tax on Rent is imposed on Landlord by any
Governmental Authority, Tenant shall, as additional Rent, reimburse Landlord, at the same time as each monthly payment of Rent is due, an amount equal to  
      4  

all such taxes Landlord is required to pay by reason of the Rent paid hereunder. If less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Rentable Area of the Building is actually occupied during any
Operating Period, Operating Expenses shall be the amount that such Operating Expenses would have been for such Operating Period had ninety-five percent (95%) of the Rentable Area of the Building been occupied during all such Operating Period, as
determined by Landlord. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Controllable Operating Expenses (defined as total Operating Expenses less those expenses related to property taxes and assessments, insurance, janitorial, utilities, and fuel
surcharges) shall not increase by more than five percent (5%) annually on a cumulative compound basis over the actual Controllable Operating Expenses for calendar year 2017.  
 (b)  Additional Rent . Landlord shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each Operating Period (or as soon thereafter
as it is reasonably able to do so), furnish Tenant with a statement of the Operating Expenses and Taxes during such year and a computation of the Additional Rent owed by Tenant for such Operating Period (  Expense Statement  ).
Failure of Landlord to provide such statement within such time period shall not be a waiver of Landlord s right to collect any Additional Rent. If such statement shows that the actual amount Tenant owes for such Operating Period is more than
the estimated Additional Rent paid by Tenant for such Operating Period, Tenant shall pay the difference within thirty (30) days after Tenant s receipt of the Expense Statement. If the Expense Statement shows that Tenant paid more in estimated
Additional Rent than the actual amount of Additional Rent owed by Tenant for such Operating Period, Tenant shall receive a credit therefor. The credit shall be applied to future monthly payments attributable to the Additional Rent, or if this Lease
has expired, such amount shall be refunded to Tenant at the time of delivery of the Expense Statement. Unless adjusted as a result of an audit by Tenant conducted pursuant to the express terms of this Lease, the Operating Expenses, Taxes and
Additional Rent set forth in the Expense Statement shall be binding upon Tenant. Landlord will provide Tenant with an Expense Statement within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the final Operating Period contained in the Term, as
provided above, and the Additional Rent shown in such Expense Statement shall be due from Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant s receipt of such statement.  
 (c)  Tenant s Audit . Tenant shall have the right to have Landlord s books and records pertaining to Operating Expenses and
Taxes for each Operating Period reviewed, copied (provided Landlord is reimbursed for the cost of such copies) and audited (  Tenant s Audit  ), provided that: (a) such right shall not be exercised more than once during any
calendar year; (b) if Tenant elects to conduct Tenant s Audit, Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice thereof (  Tenant s Audit Notice  ) no later than sixty (60) days following Tenant s receipt of the
Expense Statement for the year to which Tenant s Audit will apply; (c) Tenant shall have no right to conduct Tenant s Audit if an uncured Default by Tenant exists either at the time of Landlord s receipt of Tenant s Audit Notice
or at any time during Tenant s Audit; (d) no subtenant shall have any right to conduct an audit and no assignee shall conduct an audit for any period during which such assignee was not in possession of the Premises; (e) conducting Tenant s
Audit shall not relieve Tenant from the obligation to timely pay Base Rent or the Additional Rent, pending the outcome of such audit; (f) Tenant s right to conduct such audit for any calendar year shall expire sixty (60) days following
Tenant s receipt of the Expense Statement for such year, and if Landlord has not received Tenant s Audit Notice within such sixty (60) day period, Tenant shall have waived its right to conduct Tenant s Audit for such calendar year;
provided, however, that with respect to any audit of Operating Expenses and Taxes for the Base Year, Tenant s right to conduct an audit for such year shall expire the earlier of sixty (60) days following Tenant s receipt of the Expense
Statement for the Base Year or sixty (60) days following Tenant s receipt of the first Expense Statement forwarded by Landlord to Tenant for any Operating Period during the Term; (g) Tenant s Audit shall be conducted by a firm of
Tenant s designation whose compensation is not contingent upon the results of Tenant s Audit or the amount of any refund received by Tenant, and who is not employed by or otherwise affiliated with Tenant; (h) Tenant s Audit shall be
conducted at Landlord s office where the records of the year in question are maintained by Landlord, during Landlord s normal business hours; (i) Tenant s Audit shall be completed within sixty (60) days after the date of Tenant s
Audit Notice, and a complete copy of the results thereof shall be delivered to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of Tenant s Audit Notice; and (j) Tenant s Audit shall be conducted at Tenant s sole cost and expense. If
Tenant s Audit is completed and submitted to Landlord in accordance with the requirements of this Section and such audit demonstrates to Landlord s reasonable satisfaction that Landlord has overstated the Operating Expenses or Taxes for
the year audited, then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for any overpayment, and if such Operating Expenses or Taxes have been overstated by more than five percent (5%), then Landlord shall also reimburse Tenant for Tenant s actual, reasonable
cost incurred in conducting Tenant s Audit (not to exceed $5,000.00), with such reimbursement(s) to be made within thirty (30) days after Landlord s receipt of documentation reasonably acceptable to Landlord reflecting the amount of such
overpayment and the cost of Tenant s Audit.  
      5  

(d)  Confidentiality . Tenant hereby agrees to keep the results of Tenant s Audit
confidential and to require the auditor conducting Tenant s Audit, including its employees and each of their respective attorneys and advisors, to keep the results of Tenant s Audit in strictest confidence. In particular, but without
limitation, Tenant agrees that: (a) Tenant shall not disclose the results of Tenant s Audit to any past, current or prospective tenant of the Building; and (b) Tenant shall require that its auditors, attorneys and anyone associated with such
parties shall not disclose the results of Tenant s Audit to any past, current or prospective tenant of the Building; provided, however, that Landlord hereby agrees that nothing in items (a) or(b) of this subparagraph shall preclude Tenant from
disclosing the results of Tenant s Audit in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or pursuant to court order or discovery request, or to any current or prospective assignee or subtenant of Tenant, or to any agent, representative or
employee of Landlord who or which request the same. If Tenant intends to disclose the results of Tenant s Audit in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or if Tenant receives notice that it may be required in any such proceeding by either
the order of any judicial, regulatory or other governmental entity presiding over such proceeding, or by a discovery request made in such proceeding, to disclose the results of Tenant s Audit, then Tenant shall (i) provide Landlord with
sufficient prior written notice of Tenant s intent to make such disclosure, or such order or request for such disclosure, in order to permit Landlord to contest such intended disclosure, order or request; and (ii) cooperate with Landlord, at
Tenant s expense, in seeking a protective order or other remedy to limit the disclosure of such results to the extent reasonably required to adjudicate the matters at issue in such proceeding. If required by Landlord, Tenant shall execute and
require Tenant s auditor to execute Landlord s then-current confidentiality agreement reflecting the terms of this Section as a condition precedent to Tenant s right to conduct Tenant s Audit.  
  8.    Security Deposit  . Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deposit the amount of the Security Deposit indicated in
Section 1 with Landlord to secure Tenant s performance under this Lease. Tenant hereby grants to Landlord a security interest in the Security Deposit as collateral for all Rent and other sums of money becoming due from Tenant to Landlord under
this Lease, and for the performance of Tenant s obligations under this Lease, which security interest shall remain in effect until all such Rent and other sums of money have been paid in full and all such obligations have been fulfilled; the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this Lease constitutes a security agreement under which such security interest is granted from Tenant to Landlord. In the event of an uncured Default, defined below, then Landlord may, without prejudice to
Landlord s other remedies, apply part or all of the Security Deposit to cure such Default. If Landlord so uses part or all of the Security Deposit, then Tenant shall within ten (10) days after written demand, provide Landlord with a replacement
Security Deposit in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Any part of the Security Deposit not used by the Landlord as permitted by this Lease shall be returned to Tenant after the Expiration Date. If Landlord
sells the Building then the Landlord shall transfer the Security Deposit to the new owner and Landlord shall be relieved of any liability for the Security Deposit. Tenant shall not be entitled to any interest on the Security Deposit, and Landlord
may commingle the Security Deposit with other monies of Landlord.     9.    Initial Improvements  . The construction of any
Initial Improvements to the Premises shall be undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Lease and if applicable, the terms set forth in the Work Letter attached hereto as  Exhibit D  and incorporated herein by this
reference. Unless otherwise stated herein, the parties  respective obligations for payment of the Initial Improvements shall be governed by the terms of the Work Letter. Except as expressly stated in this Lease and in the Work Letter, Landlord
shall have no obligation to improve or otherwise modify the Premises for Tenant s occupancy.     10.    Maintenance and
Repair  . Landlord shall make such improvements, repairs or replacements as may be necessary for normal maintenance of the Building Systems serving the Premises, the exterior and the structural portions of the Building and the Common Areas.
Subject to the terms of Section 7, the maintenance and repairs to be performed by Landlord hereunder shall be at Landlord s expense, unless the need for such maintenance or repairs was caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant,
its employees, agents, contractors or invitees, in which event Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of such maintenance or repairs, plus a construction oversight fee for Landlord in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the cost and
expense of such maintenance or repairs; the construction oversight or management fee, if any, applicable to construction of the Initial Improvements shall be governed by the terms of the Work Letter and not by the provisions of this Section. Except
to the extent that Landlord is obligated to restore and repair the Premises pursuant to Section 23, Tenant, at its sole cost, shall maintain and repair the Premises and otherwise keep the Premises in good order and repair. Any repair or maintenance
by Tenant shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions and requirements of Section 16. Landlord is not responsible for  
      6  

replacing and/or repairing Tenant s fixtures or any Above Standard improvements, or fixtures. Except as expressly provided in this Lease, Tenant shall accept the Premises including any
existing appliances and Above Standard fixtures in their   AS IS, WHERE IS   condition as of the Effective Date. For purposes of this Lease, all Above Standard improvements and fixtures existing in the Premises as of the Effective
Date shall be deemed to be Tenant s property until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under this Lease, at which time such Above Standard improvements and fixtures shall
become the property of Landlord and shall be surrendered to Landlord with the Premises.     11.    Services  . Landlord shall
furnish Tenant during Tenant s occupancy of the Premises the following services: (i) Cleaning and Janitorial Services (defined in  Exhibit B ), (ii) domestic water at those points of supply provided for general office use of tenants in the
Building, (iii) electricity for normal, Building Standard office uses subject to Section 12, (iv) elevator service at the times and frequency reasonably required for normal business use of the Premises, (v) lamp and ballast replacement for Building
Standard light fixtures, (vi) HVAC service between 8:00 o clock a.m. and 6:00 o clock p.m. on Monday through Friday (  Building Standard Hours  ), except on New Year s Day, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving
Day, Christmas Day and other holidays observed by a majority of the tenants of the Building (  Holidays  ). If any Holiday falls on a weekend, the Building may observe the Holiday on the preceding Friday or the succeeding Monday. In
addition to HVAC service provided during Building Standard Hours, Landlord shall, upon Tenant s request, provide HVAC service to the Premises between the hours of 8:00 o clock a.m. and 1:00 o clock p.m. on Saturday, at no additional
charge to Tenant, provided that such request is made no later than 2:00 o clock p.m. on the immediately preceding day. Tenant may periodically request, and Landlord shall furnish HVAC service on days and at times other than those referred to
above, provided Tenant requests such service in accordance with the Project Rules, defined below, then in effect, and agrees to reimburse Landlord for this service at the then existing rate being charged in the Building. If Tenant utilizes services
provided by Landlord hereunder in either quantity and/or quality exceeding the quantity and/or quality customarily utilized by normal office uses of comparable premises in the Building, then Landlord may separately meter or otherwise monitor
Tenant s use of such services, and charge Tenant a reasonable amount for such excess usage; such amount shall constitute additional Rent due hereunder within fifteen (15) days of Tenant s receipt of Landlord s statement for such
excess. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages directly or indirectly resulting from, nor shall any Rent be abated by reason of, the installation, use or interruption of use of any equipment in connection with furnishing any of the foregoing
services, or failure to furnish or delay in furnishing any such service. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, except in the event of a casualty as provided for in Section 23 of this Lease, in the event of an interruption of any service set forth
in this Section 11 that results directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees or agents, and continues for more than five (5) consecutive business days after Landlord s receipt of written notice from Tenant
of such interruption (the   Initial Interruption Period  ), and which results in the Premises, or a portion thereof, becoming untenantable, Rent shall be abated in an equitable and just proportion relative to such interruption from
the expiration of the Initial Interruption Period until restoration of such service. The failure to furnish any such services shall not be construed as an eviction of Tenant or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such interruption of any service set forth in this Section 11 that results directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees or agents, and continues for more than one
hundred eighty (180) consecutive days after Landlord s receipt of written notice from Tenant of such interruption, with such period subject to extension for Force Majeure Events and Tenant caused delays, then, provided Tenant is not in Default
under this Lease, Tenant shall have the right terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Landlord (1) anytime during the ten (10) day period following the expiration of the aforementioned one hundred eighty (180) day period and (2) prior to
Landlord s restoration of the applicable interrupted service. Tenant shall, at Tenant s expense, be responsible for cleaning and maintaining any Above Standard improvements or fixtures, including Above Standard Tenant Work, defined below,
and Above Standard Initial Improvements, in the Premises.     12.    Electrical Usage  . (a) Landlord shall supply sufficient
electrical capacity to a panel box located in the core of each floor for lighting and for Tenant s office equipment to the extent that the total demand load at 100% capacity of such lighting and equipment does not exceed six (6) watts per RSF
in the Premises (  Electrical Design Load  ). If Tenant utilizes any portion of the Premises on a regular basis beyond Building Standard Hours or in any manner in excess of the Electrical Design Load, Landlord shall have the right to
separately meter such space and charge Tenant for all excess usage; additionally, Landlord shall have the right, at Tenant s expense, to separately meter any Above Standard fixture(s) in the Premises, such as water heaters and vending machines,
and to charge Tenant for the electricity consumed by such fixture(s). If separate metering is not practical, Landlord may reasonably estimate such excess usage and charge Tenant a reasonable hourly rate. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of all
electricity  
      7  

consumed in excess of six (6) watts per RSF in the Premises for the number of hours in the Building Standard Hours for the relevant period, plus any actual accounting expenses incurred by
Landlord in connection with the metering or calculation thereof. Tenant shall pay the cost of installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing all such meters. In the event that the level of occupancy of the Premises, or any machinery or equipment
located in the Premises, creates unusual demands on the HVAC system serving the Premises, then Tenant may install, and Landlord may require that Tenant install, its own supplemental HVAC unit(s) (  Supplemental HVAC Equipment  ) in
the Premises, and in either event the installation, maintenance and removal of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment shall be governed by the terms of  Exhibit F  attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.  
 (b) The term   Electrical Expense Stop   shall mean be $0.70 per RSF of the Premises. Electrical expenses exceeding the
Electrical Expense Stop shall be paid by Tenant on the first day of each month as additional rent. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord, at Landlord s sole discretion, may require, at Tenant s sole
cost and expense, the installation of an electrical check meter (a   Check Meter  ) for the Premises, which expense may be deducted from the Allowance, if applicable. The Check Meter will measure all electricity supplied to the
Premises (i) to operate lights and light fixtures therein, (ii) to operate equipment and fixtures that are connected to electrical outlets therein and (iii) to operate any supplemental HVAC system or unit that exclusively serves the Premises (or any
portion thereof). Landlord shall pay the local electrical utility company prior to delinquency for the electricity supplied to the Premises through the Check Meter; provided, however, in the event the amount paid by Landlord to the local electrical
utility company for electricity supplied to the Premises (as measured by the Check Meter) for any given period of time is greater than the allocable portion of the Electrical Expense Stop (allocated to the Premises for the relevant period of time),
Landlord may submit an invoice to Tenant periodically for the cost of such excess electricity supplied to the Premises and Tenant shall pay the full invoiced amount (as Additional Rent) to Landlord within ten (10) days after Tenant s receipt of
each such invoice. The following formula shall be used to determine the invoice amount for Tenant s excess electrical usage in the Premises:      

Invoice Amount 
    
 = 
   
 Total Electrical Costs Per Check Meter -  

[(Premises Electrical Expense Stop) x (Number of Days in Period  

Number of Days in Year)]  
   For example, presuming (for purposes of this illustration only) that the (i) rentable square footage of the Premises is ten
thousand (10,000) rentable square feet, (ii) Electrical Expense Stop is seventy cents (70 ) per rentable square foot, (iii) Check Meter indicates $2,000.00 of electricity was supplied to the Premises during a given ninety (90) day period and
(iv) calendar year in which such ninety (90) day period falls contains three hundred sixty-five (365) days, Landlord shall be entitled hereunder to send an invoice to Tenant in the amount of $273.80 for excess electrical usage in the Premises during
such ninety (90) day period, computed as follows:      
   In computing invoices to be sent to Tenant for electricity supplied to the Premises through the Check Meter, Landlord shall
use the same billing rate and structure as used by the local electrical utility company.     13.    Communication Lines  .
Subject to Building design limits and its existing, or then existing, capacity, Tenant may install, maintain, replace, remove or use communications or computer wires and cables which service the Premises (  Lines  ), provided: (a)
Tenant shall obtain Landlord s prior written consent, and shall use contractors approved in writing by Landlord, which consent and approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, (b) all such Lines shall be plenum rated and neatly bundled, labeled
and attached to beams and not to suspended ceiling grids, (c) any such installation, maintenance, replacement, removal or use shall comply with all Laws applicable thereto, including, but not limited to the National Electric Code, and shall not
interfere with any then existing Lines at the Building, and (d) Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses in connection therewith. Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to remove any Lines located in or serving the Premises which violate this
Lease or represent a dangerous or potentially dangerous condition, within three (3) business days after written notice. Tenant shall remove all Lines installed by or on behalf of Tenant upon termination or expiration of this Lease. Any Lines that
Landlord expressly permits to remain at the expiration or termination of this Lease shall become the property of Landlord without payment of any type. Under no circumstances shall any Line problems be deemed an actual or constructive eviction of
Tenant, render Landlord liable to Tenant for abatement of Rent, or relieve Tenant from performance of Tenant s obligations under this Lease.  
      8  

14.  Prohibited Use    .   Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done
within the Project nor bring, keep or permit anything to be brought or kept therein, which is prohibited by any Laws now in force or hereafter enacted or promulgated, or which is prohibited by any insurance policy or which may increase the existing
rate or otherwise affect any insurance which Landlord carries on the Project. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants, or injure or annoy
them or use or allow the Premises to be used for any unlawful or objectionable purpose. Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed any waste to, in or about the Premises or Project.  
  15.  Legal Requirements; Project Rules  .   Tenant shall comply with, and shall indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord and its directors, officers, partners, members, shareholders, employees and agents harmless from any and all obligations, claims, administrative proceedings, judgments, damages, fines, penalties, costs, and
liabilities, including reasonable attorneys  fees (collectively,   Costs  ) incurred by Landlord as a result of the failure by Tenant, its employees, agents or contractors to comply with all Laws relating to the use, condition or
occupancy of the Premises now or hereafter enacted, and the Project Rules, defined below. Tenant shall cause its employees, agents and contractors to comply with, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its invitees to comply with, all Laws
applicable to the Project. Tenant shall not cause or permit the use, generation, storage, release or disposal in or about the Premises or the Project of any substances, materials or wastes subject to regulation under any Laws from time to time
including, without limitation, flammable, explosive, hazardous, petroleum, toxic or radioactive materials, unless Tenant shall have received Landlord s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold or revoke at any time in its sole
discretion. Tenant shall comply with, and cause its employees, agents and contractors to comply with, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its invitees to comply with, the rules and regulations of the Project adopted by Landlord from time
to time for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Premises and the Project (  Project Rules  ). In the event of any conflict between this Lease and the Project Rules, the provisions of this Lease shall control. Landlord shall not
have any liability to Tenant for any failure of any other tenants to comply with the Project Rules. The Project Rules in effect as of the Effective Date are attached hereto as Exhibit C. In the event that any Governmental Authority, ordinance or
other Law applicable to the Project requires either Landlord or Tenant to establish and implement a transportation management plan designed to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles being used by employees and other permitted occupants of
the Building for commuting to and from the Building, then Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in establishing and implementing such plan. In the event that any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Project requires that modifications be
made to the Common Areas as a result of Tenant s particular use or occupancy of the Premises, then such modifications shall be made by Landlord, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional Rent due under this Lease, for Landlord s
reasonable cost incurred in making such modifications, with such reimbursement to be made within thirty (30) days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s statement for such cost.  
  16.  Alterations, Additions and Improvements  .   After the Commencement Date, Tenant shall not permit, make or allow to be
made any construction, alterations, physical additions or improvements in or to the Premises without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (  Tenant Work  ), nor place any signs in
the Premises which are visible from outside the Premises, without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld in Landlord s sole discretion. For purposes of clarification, Initial Improvements are not considered
 Tenant Work  for purposes of this Section 16. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord will not unreasonably withhold its consent to Tenant Work that: (i) is non-structural and does not adversely affect any Building Systems or
improvements, (ii) is not visible from the exterior of the Premises, (iii) does not affect the exterior of the Building or any Common Areas, (iv) does not violate any provision of this Lease, (v) does not violate any Laws, and (vi) will not
interfere with the use and occupancy of any other portion of the Project by any other tenant or occupant of the Project. Tenant s plans and specifications and all contractors, subcontractors, vendors, architects and engineers (collectively,
  Outside Contractors  ) shall be subject to Landlord s prior written approval. If requested by Landlord, Tenant shall execute a work letter for any such Tenant Work substantially in the form then used by Landlord for
construction performed by tenants of the Building. Tenant shall pay Landlord a construction oversight fee in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the cost and expense of any Tenant Work whether undertaken by Landlord or Tenant; the construction
oversight or management fee, if any, applicable to construction of the Initial Improvements shall be governed by the terms of the Work Letter and not by the provisions of this Section. Landlord may hire outside consultants to review such documents
and information furnished to Landlord, and Tenant shall  
      9  

reimburse Landlord for the cost thereof, including reasonable attorneys  fees, in an amount not to exceed $2,500.00, within thirty (30) days of demand. Neither review nor approval by
Landlord of any plans or specifications shall constitute a representation or warranty by Landlord that such documents either (i) are complete or suitable for their intended purpose, or (ii) comply with applicable Laws, it being expressly agreed by
Tenant that Landlord assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever to Tenant or any other person or entity for such completeness, suitability or compliance. Tenant shall furnish any documents and information reasonably requested by Landlord,
including  as-built  drawings (both in paper and in electronic format acceptable to Landlord) after completion of such Tenant Work. Landlord may impose such conditions on Tenant Work as are reasonably appropriate, including without
limitation, compliance with any construction rules adopted by Landlord from time to time, requiring Tenant to furnish Landlord with security for the payment of all costs to be incurred in connection with such Tenant Work, insurance covering Landlord
against liabilities which may arise out of such work, plans and specifications, and permits for such Tenant Work. All Building Standard Tenant Work shall become the property of Landlord upon completion and shall be surrendered to Landlord upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under this Lease, unless Landlord shall require removal or restoration of such Tenant Work by Tenant. All Tenant Work that is Above Standard shall
be and remain the property of Tenant, and shall be maintained by Tenant in good condition and repair throughout the Term, until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under this
Lease, at which time such Tenant Work shall become the property of Landlord and shall be surrendered to Landlord with the Premises, unless Landlord specifies, at the time of the approval of the installation of such Above Standard Tenant Work, that
Landlord will require Tenant to remove same upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under the Lease. Any Tenant Work that Tenant is required to remove from the Premises upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under this Lease shall be removed at Tenant s sole expense, and Tenant shall, at Tenant s expense, promptly repair any damage to the
Premises or the Building caused by such removal. Tenant shall not allow any liens to be filed against the Premises or the Project in connection with any Tenant Work. If any liens are filed, Tenant shall cause the same to be released within five (5)
days after Tenant s receipt of written notice of the filing of such lien by bonding or other method acceptable to Landlord. All Outside Contractors shall maintain insurance in amounts and types required by, and in compliance with, Section 20.
An ACORD 25 (or its equivalent) certificates of insurance in the most recent edition available evidencing such coverage shall be provided to Landlord prior to commencement of any Tenant Work. All Outside Contractors shall perform all work in a good
and workmanlike manner, in compliance with all Laws and all applicable Project Rules and Building construction rules. No Tenant Work shall be unreasonably disruptive to other tenants. Prior to final completion of any Tenant Work, Landlord shall
prepare and submit to Tenant a punch list of items to be completed, and Tenant shall diligently complete all such punch list items.  
  17.  Tenant s Equipment  .   Except for personal computers, facsimile machines, copiers and other similar office
equipment, Tenant shall not install within the Premises any fixtures, equipment or other improvements until the plans and location thereof have been approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The location, weight and
supporting devices for any libraries, central filing areas, safes and other heavy equipment shall in all cases be approved by Landlord prior to initial installation or any relocation. Landlord may prohibit any article, equipment or any other item
that may exceed the load capacity of the Building from being brought into the Building.     18.  Taxes on Tenant s
Property  .   Tenant shall pay all ad valorem and similar taxes or assessments levied upon all equipment, fixtures, furniture and other property placed by Tenant in the Premises and all license and other fees or taxes imposed on
Tenant s business. If any improvements installed or placed in the Project by, or at the expense of, Tenant result in Landlord being required to pay higher Taxes with respect to the Project than would have been payable otherwise, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord, within fifteen (15) days after demand, the amount by which such excess Taxes are reasonably attributable to Tenant.  
  19.  Access  .   Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times in order to inspect the
condition, show the Premises, determine if Tenant is performing its obligations hereunder, perform the services or make the repairs that Landlord is obligated or elects to perform hereunder, make repairs to adjoining space, cure any Defaults of
Tenant hereunder that Landlord elects to cure, and remove from the Premises any improvements or property placed therein in violation of this Lease. Except in the case of an emergency or to perform routine services hereunder, Landlord shall use
reasonable efforts to provide Tenant prior notice of such access.  
      10  

20.  Tenant s Insurance  .   Commencing the date Tenant is required to
provide Landlord with the certificate of insurance, as provided below, and continuing until the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term, Tenant shall carry and maintain at its expense the following insurance coverages with insurance
companies reasonably acceptable to Landlord with a rating of A- or better by A.M. Best Company: (i) Commercial General Liability (CGL) Policy (written on an occurrence basis), with limits not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined
single limit per occurrence, Two Million Dollar ($2,000,000) annual aggregate covering liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, products-completed operations, personal injury, advertising injury and liability assumed
under a contract; (ii) Property Damage Insurance on a Causes of Loss-Special Form basis covering on a replacement cost value all Above Standard improvements, fixtures, personal property and equipment located within the Premises; (iii) Business
Interruption and Extra Expense insurance in such amounts as will reimburse Tenant for direct or indirect loss of earnings attributable to the perils insured against under this section; (iv) Workers  Compensation insurance policy as required by
the applicable state law, and Employers Liability insurance with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00); (v) Automobile Liability insurance with single limit coverage of at least $1,000,000 for all owned, leased/hired or
non-owned vehicles; (vi) If Tenant will serve or sell alcohol at the Project, a liquor liability insurance policy with minimum coverage of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00); and (vii) Excess/Umbrella liability policy  following form  of
not less than Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000), including a  drop down  feature in case the limits of the primary policy are exhausted. Landlord may also require all Outside Contractors to provide additional types of insurance coverages
in amounts and types deemed necessary by Landlord, including, without limitation, construction All-Risk Builder s risks, Owners and Contractors Protective (OCP) Liability insurance, Professional Errors and Omissions liability insurance, and
insurance covering such contractor s equipment and tools. Each Liability insurance policy required to be maintained hereunder by Tenant shall name the following entities as Additional Insureds: Landlord, Parkway Properties, Inc., Parkway Realty
Services, LLC, and their direct and indirect parent companies and subsidiaries and any of their affiliated entities, successors and assigns, as well as their respective current or future directors, officers, employees, partners, members and agents.
Tenant s insurance shall be considered primary, not excess, and non-contributory with Landlord s insurance policies. Insurance deductibles or retentions should be reasonable and customary for policy holders in similar businesses and
locations. An ACORD 25 certificate of such insurance in the most recent edition available and reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, before the earlier of the Commencement Date or ten (10) days after execution of the Lease, reflecting the limits and
endorsements required herein, and renewal certificates shall be delivered to Landlord at least ten (10) days prior to the expiration date of any policy. Each policy shall be endorsed to provide notice of nonrenewal to Landlord and shall further
provide that it may not be materially altered or canceled without thirty (30) days prior notice to Landlord. Landlord agrees to cooperate with Tenant to the extent reasonably requested by Tenant to enable Tenant to obtain such insurance. Landlord
shall have the right to require increased limits if, in Landlord s reasonable judgment, such increase is necessary. Tenant shall pay all premiums and charges for all of said policies, and, if Tenant shall fail to make any such payment when due
or carry any such policy, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, make such payment or carry such policy, and the amount paid by Landlord, with interest thereon at the Default Rate, shall be repaid to Landlord by Tenant within ten (10) days
following demand therefor, and all such amounts so repayable, together with such interest, shall be deemed to constitute additional Rent hereunder. Payment by Landlord of any such premium, or the carrying by Landlord of any such policy, shall not be
deemed to waive or release Tenant from any remedy available to Landlord under this Lease.     21.  Landlord s
Insurance  .   Landlord shall maintain, during the Term of this Lease, (i) a commercial general liability insurance policy of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) each occurrence/Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate, and
(ii) a property insurance policy on the  Special  Perils policy form, including theft coverage, written at full replacement cost value and with replacement cost endorsement, covering the Project, including the Building and all Building
Standard improvements and fixtures in the Premises, but specifically excluding any Above Standard improvements or fixtures until such time as such Above Standard improvements or fixtures shall become the property of Landlord as provided above, and
all personal property, fixtures and improvements therein belonging to Landlord, and (iii) an excess liability policy  following form  of not less than Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000), including a  drop down  feature in case the
limits of the primary policy are exhausted. Landlord shall not be obligated to insure any property of Tenant.     22.  Waiver of
Subrogation; Mutual Waiver of Liability  .   All policies of insurance required to be carried by either party hereunder shall include a waiver of subrogation endorsement, containing a waiver by the insurer of all right of subrogation
against the other party in connection with any loss, injury or damage thereby insured against. The waiver of subrogation shall apply regardless of any deductible (or self-insured retention) or self-insurance carried by either party. Any additional
premium for such waiver shall be paid by the primary insured. To the full extent permitted  
      11  

by law, Landlord and Tenant each waive all rights of recovery against the other (and any officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives of the other), and agree to release
the other from liability, for loss or damage to the extent such loss or damage is covered by valid and collectible insurance in effect covering the party seeking recovery at the time of such loss or damage or would be covered by the insurance
required to be maintained under this Lease by the party seeking recovery. If the release of either party, as set forth above, should contravene any law with respect to exculpatory agreements, the liability of the party in question shall be deemed
not released but shall be secondary to the liability of the other s insurer.     23.  Casualty  .   If the Premises or
the Project is damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty at any time during the Term and if, after such damage or destruction, Tenant is not able to use the portion of the Premises not damaged or destroyed to substantially
the same extent and for the Authorized Use for which the Premises were leased to Tenant hereunder, and within sixty (60) days after Landlord s receipt of written notice from Tenant describing such damage or destruction Landlord provides notice
to Tenant that the Premises, as improved to the extent of the Building Standard improvements existing immediately prior to such destruction or casualty, cannot be repaired or rebuilt to the condition which existed immediately prior to such
destruction or casualty within two hundred seventy (270) days following the date of such destruction or casualty, then either Landlord or Tenant may by written notice to the other within thirty (30) days following such notice by Landlord terminate
this Lease. Unless such damage or destruction is the result of the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or invitees, the Rent shall be abated for the period and proportionately to the extent that after
such damage or destruction Tenant is not able to use the portion of the Premises damaged or destroyed for the Authorized Use and to substantially the same extent as Tenant used the Premises prior thereto. If this Lease is not terminated pursuant to
the foregoing, then upon receiving the available insurance proceeds, Landlord shall restore or replace the damaged or destroyed portions of the Premises, as improved to the extent of the Building Standard improvements existing immediately prior to
such destruction or casualty, or Project; Tenant shall restore or replace the improvements to the Premises required to be insured by Tenant hereunder; and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof except
for the abatement of Rent referred to above, if applicable, and except that the Term shall be extended by a length of time equal to the period beginning on the date of such damage or destruction and ending upon completion of such restoration or
replacement. Landlord shall restore or replace the damaged or destroyed portions of the Premises or Project that Landlord is required to restore or replace hereunder within a reasonable time, subject to Force Majeure Events and the availability of
insurance proceeds. If either party elects to terminate this Lease as provided in this Section, this Lease shall terminate on the date which is thirty (30) days following the date of the notice of termination as if the Term hereof had been scheduled
to expire on such date, and, except for obligations which are expressly stated herein to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, neither party shall have any liability to the other party as a result of such termination. Landlord
shall not be obligated to repair any damage to Above Standard improvements or fixtures, Tenant s inventory, trade fixtures or other personal property. If the Premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty caused by the recklessness
or willful misconduct of Tenant, its employees, agents, contractors, or invitees, then any repair or restoration of the Premises by Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Section shall be at Tenant s sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section to the contrary, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair or restore the Premises or the Project on account of damage resulting from any casualty which occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the Term, or if the
estimated cost of such repair or restoration would exceed fifty percent (50%) of the reasonable value of the Building prior to the casualty. The abatement of Rent, if applicable hereunder, and termination of this Lease by Tenant, if applicable
hereunder, are the sole remedies available to Tenant in the event the Premises or the Project is damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty.  
  24.  Condemnation  .   If more than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises or if a substantial portion of the Building is taken
by the power of eminent domain, then either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice to the other within thirty (30) days after the date of taking; provided, however, that a condition to the exercise by
Tenant of such right to terminate shall be that the portion of the Premises or Building taken shall be of such extent and nature as to substantially impair Tenant s use of the Premises or the balance of the Premises remaining and Landlord is
unwilling or unable to provide reasonable replacement space within the Project. In the event of any taking, Landlord shall be entitled to any and all compensation and awards with respect thereto, except for an award, if any, specified by the
condemning authority for any claim made by Tenant for property that Tenant has the right to remove upon termination of this Lease. Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired portion of the Term. In the event of a
partial taking of the Premises which does not result in a termination of this Lease, the Rent shall be equitably reduced as to the square footage so taken.  
      12  

25.  Waiver of Claims  .   Except for the willful misconduct or gross negligence
of Landlord, its employees, agents or contractors, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for damage to person or property caused by defects in the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, elevator or other apparatus or systems, or by water discharged from
sprinkler systems, if any, in the Building, nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for the theft or loss of or damage to any property of Tenant whether from the Premises or any part of the Building or Project, including the loss of trade secrets or
other confidential information. Landlord agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to protect Tenant from interference or disturbance by third persons, including other tenants; however, Landlord shall not be liable for any such interference,
disturbance or breach, whether caused by another tenant or tenants or by Landlord or any other person, nor shall Tenant be relieved from any obligation under this Lease because of such interference, disturbance or breach. Landlord may comply with
voluntary controls or guidelines promulgated by any governmental entity relating to the use or conservation of energy, water, gas, light or electricity or the reduction of automobile or other emissions without creating any liability of Landlord to
Tenant under this Lease, provided that the Premises are not thereby rendered untenantable. In no event shall Landlord, Parkway Properties LP or Parkway Realty Services, LLC or their directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees, or
agents be liable in any manner for incidental, consequential or punitive damages, loss of profits, or business interruption. The waivers in this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  
  26.  Indemnity  .   Except for claims, rights of recovery and causes of action covered by the waiver of subrogation contained
in Section 22 or waived in Section 25, Landlord shall indemnify and hold harmless Tenant and its agents, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees and invitees, from all claims, losses, costs, damages, or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys  fees) in connection with any injury to, including death of, any person or damage to any property arising, wholly or in part, out of any action, omission, or neglect of Landlord or its directors, officers, shareholders,
members, partners, employees, agents, invitees, or guests, or any parties contracting with any such party, relating to the Premises, or arising, wholly or in part, out of any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, or its directors,
officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees, or agents, or any parties contracting with any such party, relating to the Project exclusive of the Premises. If Tenant shall without fault on its part, be made a party to any action commenced by
or against Landlord, for which Landlord is obligated to indemnify Tenant hereunder, then Landlord shall protect and hold Tenant harmless from, and shall pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, of Tenant in connection
therewith.    Except for claims, rights of recovery and causes of action covered by the waiver of subrogation, Tenant shall indemnify and
hold harmless Landlord and its agents, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees and invitees, from all claims, losses, costs, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees) in connection with any injury to,
including death of, any person or damage to any property arising, wholly or in part, out of any prohibited use of the Premises or other action, omission, or neglect of Tenant or its Outside Contractors, directors, officers, shareholders, members,
partners, employees, agents, invitees, subtenants or guests, or any parties contracting with such party relating to the Project. If Landlord shall without fault on its part, be made a party to any action commenced by or against Tenant, for which
Tenant is obligated to indemnify Landlord hereunder, then Tenant shall protect and hold Landlord harmless from, and shall pay all costs, expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, of Landlord in connection therewith.  
 Landlord s and Tenant s obligations under this Section shall not be limited by the amount or types of insurance maintained or
required to be maintained under this Lease. The obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  
  27.  Non-Waiver  .   No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord to any breach by Tenant of any of its obligations
under this Lease shall be construed as or constitute a consent or waiver to any other breach by Tenant. No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Tenant to any breach by Landlord of any of its obligations under this Lease shall be construed as or
constitute a consent or waiver to any other breach by Landlord. Neither the acceptance by Landlord of any Rent or other payment, whether or not any Default by Tenant is then known to Landlord, nor any custom or practice followed in connection with
this Lease shall constitute a waiver of any of Tenant s obligations under this Lease. Failure by Landlord to complain of any act or omission by Tenant or to declare that a Default has occurred, irrespective of how long such failure may
continue, shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any of its rights hereunder. Failure by Tenant to complain of any act or omission by Landlord, irrespective of how long such failure may continue, shall not be deemed to be a waiver by
Tenant of any of its rights hereunder. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of every obligation of the parties in which time of performance is a factor. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of an amount less than the Rent
due shall be deemed to be other than a  
      13  

partial payment of the Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement of any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Landlord may accept
such check or payment without prejudice to its right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other right or remedy. Except for the execution and delivery of a written agreement expressly accepting surrender of the Premises, no act taken or
failed to be taken by Landlord shall be deemed an acceptance of surrender of the Premises.     28.  Quiet Possession  .  
Provided Tenant has performed all its obligations, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the Term, subject to the provisions of this Lease.  
  29.  Notices  .   Each notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and may be personally delivered,
sent via nationally recognized overnight courier or placed in the United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed in each case at the address specified herein. A notice shall be deemed to have
been received (a) upon the date of delivery or refusal thereof, if delivered personally or by overnight courier, or (b) if sent by registered or certified mail, (i) the date of delivery of such notice, as indicated on the duly completed United
States Postal Service return receipt, if such receipt reflects delivery of such notice, (ii) on the date of refusal of such notice, if the refused notice reflects the date on which such notice is refused, or (iii) three (3) days after mailing of
such notice, if the date of delivery of such notice cannot otherwise be established as provided above. Prior to the Commencement Date, the address for notices to Tenant shall be the address set forth in Section 1; after the Commencement Date, the
address for Tenant shall be the Premises. Any notices to Landlord shall be addressed and given to Landlord at all of the following addresses:

 Landlord s Failure to Perform  .   If Landlord fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, Landlord shall not be in default and Tenant shall not have any rights or remedies growing out of such failure unless Tenant gives
Landlord written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such failure and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days following Landlord s receipt of such notice or such longer period as may otherwise be
provided herein. If such failure cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, the length for curing shall be extended as reasonably required.  
  31.  Tenant s Failure to Perform  .   If Tenant fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, in addition to the
other rights of Landlord, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform all or any part of Tenant s obligations. Upon receipt of a demand therefor, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the reasonable cost of performing such
obligations, plus interest thereon at the Default Rate, defined below.     32.  Default  .     Default   means
the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (i) failure of Tenant to pay when due any Rent or other amount required to be paid hereunder, if such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Tenant s receipt of written notice
thereof from Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord shall not be required to provide Tenant with notice of such failure and the ten (10) day period within which to cure such failure more than twice during the Term, and, at Landlord s
election, a subsequent failure to timely pay the Rent when due shall immediately constitute a Default hereunder; (ii) failure of Tenant, after thirty (30) days written notice, or such  
      14  

other notice period specified in this Lease, to observe and fully perform all of Tenant s obligations hereunder, other than payment of Rent which is covered above, except as otherwise
provided below; (iii) the adjudication of Tenant to be bankrupt; (iv) the filing by Tenant of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or other similar proceedings; (v) the making by Tenant of a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (vi)
the appointment of a receiver of Tenant s interests in the Premises; (vii) any involuntary proceedings instituted against Tenant under any bankruptcy or similar laws, unless such is dismissed or stayed within sixty (60) days thereafter; (viii)
if the Tenant is an individual or if the Tenant is controlled by a single individual, the death or incapacity of such individual; (ix) the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or other similar proceeding by any Guarantor of Tenant s
obligations hereunder, or if such Guarantor is an individual or controlled by a single individual, the death or incapacity of such individual; (x) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Guarantor, or any transaction involving the Guarantor
which, if done by Tenant would constitute an assignment by Tenant hereunder, without the written consent of Landlord; or (xi) vacancy of the Premises for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. Notwithstanding any applicable notice and
cure period provided above, Landlord shall not, with respect to the occurrence of any of the events described in subparts (ii) through (xi) above, be required to provide Tenant with notice of such failure and the cure period, if any, that would
otherwise be applicable to such failure, more than twice during the Term for substantially the same failure, and, at Landlord s election, a subsequent occurrence of substantially the same failure shall immediately constitute a Default
hereunder.    Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord may, at its option and without waiving any other rights available herein, at law,
or in equity, require Tenant to pay Rent by (a) wire transfer of funds to an account designated by Landlord or (b) direct draft from Tenant s account through bank draft, ACH transfer, or other equivalent funds transfer to Landlord s
designated account. Execution of this Lease by Tenant and Landlord shall be evidence of Landlord s authorization to debit Tenant s account as set forth herein. Tenant shall provide all necessary information and execute any additional
documents requested by Landlord to facilitate payment of Rent by the method designated by Landlord. Tenant s failure to provide such information or documents within five (5) days after written notice by Landlord shall constitute a Default
hereunder.    Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord may, at its option, without terminating this Lease, and with or without notice to
Tenant, enter into and upon the Premises and, without being liable for any damages as a result thereof, maintain the Premises and repair or replace any damage to the Premises or do anything for which Tenant is responsible hereunder on Tenant s
behalf; and, in such event, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord immediately upon demand for any reasonable expenses which Landlord incurs in effecting Tenant s compliance under this Lease.  
 In addition, if a Default occurs, then or at any time thereafter while such Default continues, Landlord, at its option, may, without waiving
any other rights available herein, at law, or in equity, either terminate this Lease or terminate Tenant s right to possession without terminating this Lease. In either event, Landlord may, without additional notice and without court
proceedings, reenter and repossess the Premises, and remove all persons and property therefrom using such force as may be reasonably necessary. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, it may treat the Default as an entire breach of this Lease
and Tenant immediately shall become liable to Landlord for damages for the entire breach in an amount equal to the total Rent and all other payments due for the balance of the Term discounted at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum to the then
present value, and all unpaid Rent through the date of such termination. If Landlord elects to terminate Tenant s right to possession of the Premises without terminating this Lease, Landlord may rent the Premises or any part thereof for the
account of Tenant to any person for such rent and for such terms and other conditions as Landlord deems practical, and Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for the amount, if any, by which the total Rent and all other payments herein provided for the
unexpired balance of the Term exceed the net amount, if any, received by Landlord from such re-renting, being the gross amount so received less the cost of repossession, re-renting, remodeling and other expenses relating thereto; Tenant shall be and
remain liable for such net amount even after an eviction of Tenant from the Premises, should an eviction of Tenant from the Premises occur. Such sums shall be immediately due and payable by Tenant upon demand. In no event shall Tenant be entitled to
any rents received by Landlord from reletting the Premises, even if Landlord relets the Premises for an amount exceeding the Rent due from Tenant for the remainder of the unexpired Term. If a Default occurs or in case of any holding over or
possession by Tenant of the Premises after the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord on demand for all costs incurred by Landlord in connection therewith including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys 
fees, court costs and related costs plus interest thereon at the Default Rate, defined below. Actions by Landlord to collect amounts due from Tenant as provided in this Section may be brought at any time, and from time to time, on one or more
occasions, without the necessity of Landlord s waiting until the termination of this Lease. The remedies expressed herein are cumulative and not exclusive, and the election by Landlord to terminate Tenant s right to possession without
terminating this Lease shall not deprive Landlord of the right, and Landlord shall have the continuing right, to terminate this Lease. Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord shall have the right to recover from Tenant all damages caused by
Tenant s Default and to pursue all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.  
      15  

33.    Surrender  . On the last day of the Term, or upon the earlier termination
hereof, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly surrender the Premises to Landlord, in good order and repair, excepting only reasonable wear and tear resulting from normal use. The Premises shall be surrendered free of all items of Tenant s personal
property, and otherwise in the condition required by the terms of this Lease, and the Premises shall be free and clear of any and all liens or encumbrances of any type.  
  34.    Holding Over  . If Tenant does not surrender possession of the Premises at the end of the Term or upon earlier
termination of this Lease, at the election of Landlord, Tenant shall be a tenant-at-sufferance from day to day and the Rent due during the period of such holdover shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amount which Tenant was obligated to
pay for the immediately preceding month. Landlord shall provide Tenant with at least sixty (60) days  prior written notice (or, if it is not practicable for Landlord to provide sixty (60) days  notice, then the greatest amount of notice
possible given the circumstances) of a new tenant s intent to occupy the Premises or commence improvements to the Premises. If, following provision of such notice, Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises to a new tenant or to
perform improvements to the Premises for a new tenant as a result of Tenant s holdover, then Tenant shall be liable for all actual damages that Landlord suffers as a result of Tenant s holding over in the Premises.  
  35.    Removal of Tenant s Property  . Prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall, at
Tenant s expense, remove all of Tenant s removable trade fixtures and other items of personal property from the Premises. Tenant shall be responsible for any damage to the Premises or Project resulting from removal of any personal
property, including Lines, of Tenant. If Tenant does not remove its property prior to termination, then, in addition to its other remedies at law or in equity, Landlord shall have the right to consider the property abandoned and such property may be
removed by Landlord, at Tenant s expense, or at Landlord s option become its property, and Tenant shall have no further rights relating thereto or for reimbursement therefor.  
  36.    Landlord s Lien  . In addition to and cumulative of Landlord s statutory lien, Tenant hereby grants to
Landlord a security interest in and to all furniture, furnishings, fixtures, equipment (other than computer hard drives), merchandise and other property placed in the Premises by Tenant to secure the performance of Tenant s obligations under
this Lease. At Landlord s request, Tenant shall execute and cause or permit to be filed in the appropriate public records all documents required to perfect such security interest pursuant to the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in
the state where the Project is located.     37.    Interest  . All amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease, if
not paid when due, shall bear interest from the date due until paid at a rate equal to the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) per annum, compounded monthly, or the then maximum lawful rate (  Default Rate  ).  
  38.    Assignment and Subletting  . Landlord shall have the right to transfer and assign in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise, its rights and obligations hereunder whenever Landlord, in its sole judgment, deems it appropriate without any liability to Tenant, and Tenant shall attorn to any party to which Landlord transfers its rights and obligations
hereunder or the Building. Any sale, conveyance or transfer of the Building or Project will operate to release Landlord from liability from and after the effective date of such sale, conveyance, transfer or assignment upon all of the covenants,
terms and conditions of this Lease, express or implied, except for those liabilities that arose prior to the effective date of such sale, conveyance, transfer or assignment. After such effective date, Tenant will look solely to Landlord s
successor in interest in and to this Lease.    Tenant shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber this Lease, or any
interest herein, and shall not sublet the Premises or any part thereof, or any right or privilege appurtenant thereto, or permit any other party to occupy or use the Premises, or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Landlord s consent shall not be considered unreasonably withheld if: (i) the proposed subtenant s or assignee s financial responsibility or insurance does not meet the same
criteria Landlord uses to select comparable Building tenants; (ii) the proposed subtenant s or assignee s business is not, in the Landlord s reasonable good faith judgment, suitable for the Building considering the business of the
other tenants and the Building s prestige; (iii) the proposed use is inconsistent with the Authorized Use permitted by Section 3; or (iv) the proposed subtenant or assignee is an occupant of the Building, or if the proposed subtenant or
assignee, whether  
      16  

or not an occupant of the Building, is in discussions with Landlord regarding the leasing of space within the Building. Whether or not Landlord consents to any proposed assignment or subletting
of any portion of the Premises, Tenant shall timely pay Landlord s review and processing fee of $750.00 (  Sublease/Assignment Processing Fee  ) in addition to any reasonable professional fees (including, without limitation,
legal, architectural, engineering, and consulting fees) incurred by Landlord in connection with such proposed assignment or subletting not to exceed $2,500.00 (  Sublease/Assignment Professional Fees  ). The Sublease/Assignment
Processing Fee shall be paid by Tenant simultaneously with each request by Tenant to assign or sublease any portion of the Premises. The Sublease/Assignment Professional Fees shall, at Landlord s option, be paid by Tenant (a) prior to
Landlord s denial or execution of a consent to the proposed assignment or subletting or (b) within ten (10) days of Tenant s receipt of an invoice from Landlord for such fees. Any subletting of the Premises or assignment of the Lease by
Tenant in violation of the provisions of this Section 38 shall constitute a Default.    A  Change in Control  of Tenant shall be
deemed for purposes of this Lease to constitute an assignment of this Lease by Tenant which shall require the consent of Landlord and entitle Landlord to exercise its options as provided hereunder. As used in this Section, a   Change in
Control   shall be deemed to have occurred when: (x) any person, after the date hereof, acquires directly or indirectly the Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of any voting
interests or equity interests of Tenant and immediately after such acquisition such person is, directly or indirectly, the Beneficial Owner of voting or equity interests representing 50% or more of the total voting interest or equity interest of all
of the then-outstanding equity interests or voting interests of Tenant; (y) the stockholders, partners, members or other equity holders of Tenant shall approve a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or reorganization of Tenant, or consummation
of any such transaction if equity holder approval is not sought or obtained; or (z) the stockholders, partners, members or other equity holders of Tenant shall approve a plan of complete liquidation of Tenant or an agreement for the sale or
disposition by Tenant of all or a substantial portion of such entity s assets (i.e., 50% or more of the total assets of such entity).  
 If Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublease the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord notice in writing at least thirty (30) days in
advance of the date on which Tenant desires such assignment or sublease to take effect. Tenant s notice shall include (A) the name and address of the proposed subtenant or assignee; (B) the nature of the proposed subtenant s or
assignee s business it will operate in the Premises; (C) the terms of the proposed sublease or assignment; and (D) reasonable financial information so that Landlord can evaluate the proposed subtenant or assignee. Landlord shall, within twenty
(20) days after receiving such information, give notice to the Tenant to (i) permit or deny the proposed sublease or assignment or (ii) terminate this Lease as to the space so affected as of the date specified in Tenant s notice (and as to
option (ii) only, Tenant will be relieved of all further obligations hereunder as to the terminated space). If Landlord does not give notice within the thirty (30) day period, then Landlord shall be deemed to have consented to the sublease or
assignment upon the terms provided in Tenant s notice.    Notwithstanding an assignment or subletting (i) subleases and assignments by
Tenant shall be subject to the terms of this Lease; (ii) Tenant shall remain liable for all of the obligations of  Tenant  under this Lease; (iii) consent to one sublease or assignment does not waive the consent requirement for future
assignments or subleases; and (iv) fifty percent (50%) of the consideration received by Tenant from an assignment or sublease that exceeds the amount Tenant must pay Landlord hereunder, excluding reasonable leasing commissions paid by Tenant,
payments attributable to the amortization of the cost of improvements made to the Premises at Tenant s cost for the assignee or sublessee, and other reasonable, out-of-pocket costs paid by Tenant directly related to Tenant s obtaining an
assignee or sublessee, shall also be paid to Landlord. Tenant shall pay such amount to Landlord at the beginning of each calendar month. Landlord shall have the right to audit Tenant s books and records to verify the accuracy of the payments
under this Section. If Tenant has sublet the Premises, and thereafter a Default occurs hereunder, Landlord may proceed to collect any rent thereafter becoming due to Tenant under the sublease directly from the subtenant; in which event such
collected rent shall be applied by Landlord to the Rent due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder; provided, however, that the collection of rent from Tenant s subtenant shall not create a privity of contract between Landlord and such subtenant.
   If the proposed sublessee or assignee is approved by Landlord and Tenant fails to enter into the sublease or assignment with the approved
sublessee or assignee within ninety (90) days after the date Tenant submitted its proposal to Landlord, then Landlord s approval shall expire, and Tenant must comply again with the conditions of this Section. Notwithstanding the giving by
Landlord of its consent to any sublease or assignment with respect to the Premises, no sublessee or assignee may exercise any renewal options, expansion options, rights of first refusal or similar rights except in accordance with a separate written
agreement entered into directly between the Landlord and such sublessee or assignee provided Tenant continues to be liable for the performance of all obligations hereunder, as increased or otherwise affected by the exercise of such rights. Tenant
may not exercise any renewal options, expansion options, rights of first refusal or similar rights under this Lease if Tenant has assigned all of its interest in this Lease excepting transfers as set forth in the following paragraph of this Section
38.  
      17  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may assign this Lease or sublease part or all of the
Premises without Landlord s consent to: (i) any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, Tenant at the Commencement Date; or (ii) any corporation or limited
liability company resulting from the merger or consolidation with Tenant or to any entity that acquires all of Tenant s assets as a going concern of the business that is being conducted on the Premises; provided however, the assignor remains
liable under the Lease and the assignee or sublessee is a bona fide entity and assumes the obligations of Tenant, is as creditworthy as the Tenant, and continues the same Authorized Use as provided under Section 3 of this Lease.  
  39.  Merger of Estates  . The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant or a mutual cancellation hereof, shall not work
a merger, but shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing subleases or subtenancies, or may, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to Landlord of Tenant s interest in such subleases or subtenancies.  
  40.  Limitation of Liability  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Tenant s sole and exclusive method of
collecting on any judgment Tenant obtains against Landlord, or any other award made to Tenant in any judicial process requiring the payment of money by Landlord for the failure of Landlord to perform any of its obligations, shall be to proceed
against the interests of Landlord in and to the Project. Therefore, Tenant hereby agrees that no personal or corporate liability of any kind or character whatsoever now attaches or at any time hereafter under any condition shall attach to Landlord
for payment or performance of any obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, any Landlord indemnity obligations under Section 26. The obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
    41.  Subordination  . The rights and interests of Tenant under this Lease and in and to the Premises shall be subject and
subordinate to all easements and recorded restrictions, covenants, and agreements pertaining to the Project, or any part thereof, and to all deeds of trust, mortgages, and other security instruments and to all renewals, modifications,
consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof (the  Security Documents ) heretofore or hereafter executed by Landlord covering the Premises, the Building or any part of the Project, to the same extent as if the Security Documents had
been executed, delivered and recorded prior to the execution of this Lease. After Tenant s receipt of a notice from Landlord that it has entered into one or more Security Documents, then, during the term of such Security Documents, Tenant shall
deliver to the holder or holders of all Security Documents a copy of all notices to Landlord and shall grant to such holder or holders the right to cure all defaults, if any, of Landlord hereunder within the same time period provided in this Lease
for curing such defaults by Landlord and, except with the prior written consent of the holder or holders of the Security Documents, shall not surrender or terminate this Lease except pursuant to a right to terminate expressly set forth in this
Lease. Tenant shall attorn to any holder of any Security Documents or its successor in interest by foreclosure or otherwise. The provisions of this subsection shall be self-operative and shall not require further agreement by Tenant; however, at the
request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute such further documents as may be required by the holder of any Security Documents. Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Tenant, at Tenant s cost and expense, in obtaining a
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement from Landlord s mortgagee on such mortgagee s then standard form. At any time and from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days  prior notice by Landlord, Tenant shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Landlord a written estoppel certificate certifying: (i) the Rentable Area of the Premises, (ii) the Commencement Date and Expiration Date of this Lease, (iii) the Base Rent, Base Year and Additional Rent, (iv)
that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, or if there have been modifications, that the same is in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications, (v) whether or not the Landlord is in default in the keeping,
observance or performance of any covenant, agreement, term, provision or condition of this Lease and, if so, specifying each such default, (vi) that Tenant has unconditionally accepted and occupied the Premises, (vii) that all requirements of the
Lease have been complied with and no charges, set-offs or other credits exist against any rentals, (viii) that Tenant has not assigned, pledged, sublet, or otherwise transferred any interest in this Lease; and (ix) such other matters as Landlord may
reasonably request, it being intended that any such statement may be relied upon by Landlord, any prospective purchaser, mortgagee or assignee of any mortgage of the Building or the Project or of the Landlord s interest therein.  
  42.  Legal Interpretation  . This Lease shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state where the
Project is located. The determination that any provision of this Lease is invalid, void, illegal, or unenforceable shall not affect or invalidate the remainder. All obligations of the parties requiring any performance
 
      18  

after the expiration of the Term shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease and shall be fully enforceable in accordance with those provisions pertaining thereto. If Tenant
consists of two or more parties, then all parties comprising the Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of Tenant hereunder. Should any provisions of this Lease require judicial interpretation, it is agreed that the court
interpreting or construing the same shall not apply a presumption that the terms of any such provision shall be more strictly construed against one party or the other by reason of a rule of construction that a document is to be construed most
strictly against the party who itself or through its agent prepared the same, it being agreed that the agents of both parties hereto have participated in the preparation of this Lease.  
  43.  Use of Names and Signage  . Tenant shall not have the right to use the name of the Project or Building except in connection
with Tenant s address, and then such terms cannot be emphasized or displayed with more prominence than the rest of such address. Landlord shall have the right to change the name of the Building or Project whenever Landlord in its sole judgment
deems appropriate without any consent of or liability to Tenant. Any signage of Tenant within its Premises is subject to the prior written approval of Landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided in all cases,
Tenant shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such signage complies with all applicable Laws and for all costs and expenses relating to any such signage, including, without limitation, design, installation, any operating costs, maintenance,
cleaning, repair and removal. Tenant shall be obligated to pay the cost and expense of repairing any damage associated with the removal of any such signage. Tenant shall have no right to place any signage outside the Premises, on the exterior of the
Building or elsewhere in the Project. Landlord, at Landlord s cost, shall provide Tenant with Building Standard signage located (a) in the Building s lobby and (b) at the suite entrance to the Premises. Provided Tenant is not in Default
under the Lease, and Tenant continues to lease at least 17,051 rentable square feet of space in the Building, Landlord shall install Tenant s company name on one (1) Building Standard display panel on the Building s directional monument
sign located between the parking garage and Building existing as of the Effective Date (the   Monument Sign  ), provided that (i) the location of such panel shall be as determined by Landlord, (ii) Tenant s display panel shall
not be larger than the display panel of any other tenant of the Building on the Monument Sign, and (iii) Tenant s display panel shall comply with all applicable Laws, with Landlord otherwise retaining the right to determine the design, style,
color, shape, material, and size of such display panel. The monument signage right granted herein is not exclusive and Landlord reserves the right to grant monument signage rights to others. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
(x) Landlord shall have the right to update, modify, relocate, replace, repair and otherwise change the Monument Sign so long as Tenant retains the right to display its company name on such sign, and (y) in the event that at any time the Monument
Sign ceases to exist, or is damaged in whole or in material part, then Landlord shall be under no duty or obligation to repair or replace the Monument Sign.  
  44.  Relocation  . Landlord reserves the right to relocate the Premises to reasonably comparable space within the Project. Landlord
will give Tenant written notice of its intention to relocate the Premises, and Tenant will complete such relocation within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice. Upon relocation, this Lease will be amended by deleting the description of the
original Premises and substituting for it a description of such new space. Landlord agrees to reimburse Tenant for its actual reasonable moving costs within the Project, the reasonable costs of reprinting reasonable quantities of stationery, and the

EXHIBIT D TO LEASE   
  WORK LETTER     This Work
Letter supplements the Lease to which this Work Letter is attached and, together with the Lease, governs the construction of the Initial Improvements to the Premises. All capitalized terms appearing in this Work Letter shall have the same meaning as
those appearing in the Lease, except as expressly modified herein.      

1.  
  Initial Improvements         

a. 
 The design and construction of the improvements shown in the Construction Documents defined below (the   Initial Improvements  ) shall be at the expense of Landlord, except as otherwise provided below.
The Construction Documents shall be based on the space plan attached to this Work Letter as Exhibit D-1 (the   Space Plan  ), and the scope of construction and Building Standard materials to be used in connection with such
construction designated on Exhibit D-2 to this Work Letter (the   Scope of Construction  ).        

b. 
 The cost of the Initial Improvements shall include all   hard   construction costs (e.g., materials) and related   soft   costs (e.g., architectural fees, construction management fees and
other indirect construction costs incurred by Landlord or its contractor in constructing the Initial Improvements). In connection with the services to be provided by Landlord hereunder, a construction management fee equal to five percent (5%) of the
total cost of the Initial Improvements shall be paid to Parkway Realty Services, LLC (an affiliate of Landlord) (the   Construction Management Fee  ). The total amount of the hard and soft construction costs and the Construction
Management Fee is referred to herein as the   Improvement Costs .         

c. 
 All Improvement Costs shall be paid by Landlord, except to the extent the Improvement Costs are increased as a result of (i) any change requested by Tenant to the Space Plan, the Scope of Construction or the Final
Construction Documents, defined below, or (ii) Tenant Delay, defined below, in either of which instances such excess costs (the   Excess Costs  ) shall be Tenant s responsibility, and Tenant shall pay such Excess Costs to
Landlord within ten (10) days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s invoice for such Excess Costs.        

2.  
  Construction Documents         

a. 
 The parties acknowledge that they have approved the Space Plan for the Premises attached to this Work Letter as  Exhibit D-1  and the Scope of Construction attached to this
Work Letter as Exhibit D-2. Neither review nor approval by Landlord of the Space Plan or the Scope of Construction shall constitute a representation or warranty by Landlord that such documents are either (i) complete or suitable for their intended
purpose or (ii) comply with applicable Laws.        

b. 
 Landlord s architect shall prepare a set of construction documents sufficient for permitting and obtaining bids for the construction and installation of the Initial Improvements (the   Construction
Documents  ). Tenant shall have five (5) business days from receipt of the Construction Documents to review and approve the Construction Documents, and thereafter the approved Construction Documents shall be the   Final Construction
Documents .         

c. 
 Tenant shall not, without Landlord s prior written approval, make any changes to the Final Construction Documents.        

3.  
  Construction of Initial Improvements

 Upon the full execution of the Lease and the approval by both parties of the Final Construction Documents, Landlord shall proceed to construct the Initial Improvements in accordance with the Final Construction
Documents.    
      29  

b. 
 If Tenant desires to change the Final Construction Documents, Tenant shall, at its expense, provide to Landlord plans and specifications for such change(s). All such plans and specifications shall be subject to
Landlord s written approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. In the event any such approved change increases the Improvement Costs, such increase shall constitute Excess Costs and shall be paid by Tenant as provided in Section 1(c) of
this Work Letter.        

c. 
 If Tenant requests Landlord to perform additional work to the Premises outside the scope of the Final Construction Documents, then such work shall be performed by Landlord at Tenant s expense. Prior to commencing
any such work requested by Tenant, Landlord will submit to Tenant written estimates of the cost of any such work. If Tenant fails to approve any such estimate within ten (10) days, then the same shall be deemed disapproved in all respects by Tenant,
and Landlord shall not be authorized to proceed thereon.        

d. 
 If Tenant fails to provide Landlord with any of the above-specified items within twenty (20) days after the dates specified herein, then Landlord may, at its option, declare a Default under the Lease and exercise any of
Landlord s remedies for Default thereunder, including terminating the Lease. If Landlord so terminates the Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in refurbishing the Premises for Tenant within ten (10)
days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s invoice for same.        

e. 
 Upon Substantial Completion (defined below), Landlord will assign to Tenant, on a nonexclusive basis, all warranties available from the contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, and materialmen for
construction of the Initial Improvements.   Substantial Completion   shall mean the earlier of (i) the date the Initial Improvements are completed such that Tenant can take beneficial occupancy of the Premises (with the term
 beneficial occupancy  defined as the Premises being ready for furniture installation and/or move-in by Tenant) or (ii) the date an applicable certificate or temporary certificate of occupancy or completion, as applicable, is issued with
respect to the Initial Improvements. Tenant s sole and exclusive remedy for any defects in materials and/or workmanship shall be for the repair of such defects, or the replacement of the portion of the Initial Improvements affected by such
defects, under the aforementioned warranties, and Landlord shall not be responsible for any defect of any nature in the Initial Improvements. Landlord makes no warranties, expressed or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, in connection with the Initial Improvements. Tenant s sole remedy for breach of any applicable warranty shall be the remedy set forth in this Section. Tenant agrees that no other remedy,
including without limitation incidental or consequential damages for lost profits, injury to person or property, or any other incidental or consequential loss, shall be available to Tenant.    

f. 
 During the thirty (30) day period preceding Substantial Completion, Tenant s architects, vendors, and other duly authorized agents shall have the right to enter the Premises for purposes of inspection, making
measurements, and installing system furniture (after any floor covering that is part of the Initial Improvements has been installed), phone equipment, and telecommunications cabling, provided each such agent presents Landlord with a
Landlord-approved certificate of insurance naming Landlord as an Additional Insured. All contractors engaged by Tenant shall be required to comply with the Construction Rules and Regulations for the Building, a copy of which Tenant shall obtain from
Landlord prior to commencing any such work in the Premises.        

g. 
 Upon Substantial Completion, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a punch list of items requiring completion and/or correction with regard to the Initial Improvements (  Punch List  ). Landlord shall
complete the Punch List as soon as reasonably practicable. Landlord shall own all Building Standard Initial Improvements as part of the Building. Upon Substantial Completion, the Initial Improvements shall be deemed by Tenant to be satisfactorily
completed except to the extent noted in the Punch List.        

h. 
   All Above Standard Initial Improvements shall be and remain the property of Tenant, until the expiration or
earlier termination of the Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under     
      30  

this Lease, at which time such Above Standard Initial Improvements shall become the property of Landlord and shall be surrendered to Landlord with the Premises, unless Landlord specifies, at the
time of the approval of the installation of such Above Standard Initial Improvements, that Landlord will require Tenant to remove same upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease or Tenant s right to possession of the Premises under
the Lease. Any required removal of Above Standard Initial Improvements shall be at Tenant s expense, and upon such removal, Tenant shall repair any damage to the Premises resulting from such removal. Tenant shall, at Tenant s expense, be
responsible for cleaning and maintaining any Above Standard Initial Improvements in good condition and repair throughout the Term of this Lease, and Tenant shall insure same as provided in Section 20 of the Lease.    

4.  
  Selection of Contractor       Landlord, acting in its sole and absolute discretion, shall
have the right to select the contractor for the Initial Improvements.      

5.  
  Commencement Date       The Commencement Date of this Lease shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of Section 1(h) of the Lease. Provided, however, that for purposes of determining the Commencement Date pursuant to Section 1(h) of the Lease, the date on which Substantial Completion shall be deemed to have occurred shall be
accelerated on a day-for-day basis for each day of Tenant Delay, defined below. For example, if Substantial Completion actually occurs on January 16 of a given year, but there were fifteen (15) days of Tenant Delay, then Substantial Completion
will be deemed to have occurred on January 1 of such year.      

6.  
  Tenant Delay       The term  Tenant Delay  shall mean each day that Substantial
Completion is delayed by any of the following:      

a. 
 Tenant s failure to respond within the time periods specified in this Work Letter, and if no applicable time period is specified in this Work Letter, then within reasonable time periods prescribed by Landlord, to a
request for information necessary for the completion of the Construction Documents or the Final Construction Documents; or

EXHIBIT F   
  SUPPLEMENTAL HVAC EQUIPMENT   
 The provisions of this Exhibit shall govern the installation, maintenance and removal of all Supplemental HVAC Equipment installed in the
Premises. The installation of Supplemental HVAC Equipment in the Premises shall be at Tenant s sole expense, and shall include the installation of a submeter to monitor the electricity used by the Supplemental HVAC Equipment. Prior to
installing any Supplemental HVAC Equipment in the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord with plans and specifications for same and obtain Landlord s written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon receiving such
approval, Tenant shall install the Supplemental HVAC Equipment in compliance with Laws, including all building, electrical, and safety codes, applicable to the Project. Prior to installing the Supplemental HVAC Equipment, Tenant shall obtain any
permits or licenses that may be required in order to install and operate such equipment, and Tenant shall timely deliver copies of same to Landlord. In no event shall Tenant s installation of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment damage the Premises
or the Building, or interfere with the maintenance of the Building, or any system currently serving the Building, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand the cost of repairing any damage to the Building caused by such installation. Tenant shall
notify Landlord upon completion of the installation of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment, and Landlord shall have five (5) business days after installation of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment during which to inspect its installation. Tenant shall not
commence operation of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment until Landlord has approved its installation. Tenant shall be solely liable for any damages or injury arising out of the installation of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment, and Tenant s
indemnity of Landlord contained in Section 26 shall specifically apply to the installation, operation, maintenance and removal of the Supplemental HVAC Equipment. During the Term of this Lease, as the same may be extended from time to time, Tenant
shall be solely responsible for maintaining the Supplemental HVAC Equipment in good working order at Tenant s sole expense, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all electricity consumed by the Supplemental HVAC Equipment, as additional Rent
due hereunder, within thirty (30) days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s invoice for same. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove the Supplemental HVAC Equipment from the Premises, and repair all
damage to the Premises or the Building caused by the installation or removal of such equipment.  
      36  

EXHIBIT G   
  EXTENSION OPTION     Tenant
shall have the following option to extend the Term of this Lease:      

(a) 
  Grant of Extension Option . So long as this Lease is in full force and effect; no Default has occurred during the twelve (12) month period prior to Landlord s receipt of the Preliminary notice, defined below;
and no Default exists, either at the time of the exercise of the option set forth herein or at the commencement of the Extension Term set forth herein, Tenant is hereby granted the option to extend the Term of this Lease (the   Extension
Option  ) for a period of five (5) additional years (the   Extension Term  ), to commence at the expiration of the initial Term of the Lease. The extension of this Lease shall be upon the same terms and conditions of this
Lease, except: (i) the Base Rent applicable during the Extension Term shall be determined as set forth below; (ii) Tenant shall have no option to extend this Lease beyond the expiration of the Extension Term; (iii) Tenant shall not have the right to
assign its extension rights to any subtenant of the Premises or assignee of the Lease, nor may any such subtenant or assignee exercise or enjoy the benefit of the Extension Option except transfer not requiring Landlord s consent; and (iv) the
leasehold improvements will be provided in their then existing condition at the time the Extension Term commences.        

(b) 
  Preliminary Notice . If Tenant intends to exercise the Extension Option, Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice, in accordance with the Notices provision of this Lease (the   Preliminary
Notice  ), of such intention at least nine (9) months,, prior to the expiration of the initial Term of the Lease. If, for whatever reason, Tenant does not forward Preliminary Notice to Landlord, in accordance with the terms of this
paragraph, that Tenant intends to exercise the Extension Option, then the Extension Option set forth herein shall expire, and Tenant shall not thereafter have any right to exercise the Extension Option or otherwise acquire an interest in the
Premises after the expiration of the initial Term of this Lease.        

(c) 
  Rental Applicable During Extension Term . Within thirty (30) days after Landlord s receipt of Tenant s Preliminary Notice, Landlord shall provide Tenant with written notice (the   Rent
Notice  ), of the Base Rent that will be applicable during the Extension Term, and the Base Year that will be used during the Extension Term (collectively, the   Extension Term Rent  ). The Extension Term Rent shall be
determined by Landlord, and shall consist of Landlord s good faith determination of the market rental rate for the Premises as of the commencement of the Extension Term, taking into consideration such factors as rental for comparable premises
in the Building; the applicable base year; rental for comparable premises in existing buildings in the same geographical area as the Building (taking into consideration, but not limited to, use, quality, age and location of the applicable building);
the rentable area of the premises being leased; the length of the pertinent rental term; the quality and creditworthiness of the tenant, and such other factors as Landlord may reasonably determine are relevant.    

(d) 
  Extension Notice . If, after review of Landlord s determination of the Extension Term Rent, Tenant elects to exercise the Extension Option, then, no later than fifteen (15) days after Tenant s receipt of
Landlord s Rent Notice, Tenant shall forward written notice of such election (the   Extension Notice  ) to Landlord in accordance with the Notices provision of this Lease. Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after presentation
by Landlord, execute an amendment to this Lease, which amendment shall reflect the extension of the Term of the Lease through the expiration of the Extension Term, and the Extension Term Rent (including the specification of the base rent and the
base year that will be applicable during the Extension Term). If, after providing Landlord with Tenant s Preliminary Notice, Tenant does not, for whatever reason, provide Landlord with the Extension Notice required hereunder in order to
exercise the Extension Option, or the Arbitration Notice, as defined below, then the Extension Option shall expire; Tenant s Preliminary Notice shall be of no further force or effect; and it shall be as if the Preliminary Notice had never been
forwarded by Tenant to Landlord.        

(e) 
  Negotiation Period . If, after review of Landlord s determination of the Extension Term Rent, Tenant desires to exercise the Extension Option, but Tenant objects to Landlord s determination of the
Extension Term Rent, then no later than fifteen (15) days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s Rent Notice, Tenant may forward written notice to Landlord in accordance with the Notices provision of this Lease that Tenant elects to proceed
with the arbitration procedure set forth below (the   Arbitration Notice  ). Within the fifteen (15) day period    
      37  

following Landlord s receipt of the Arbitration Notice (the   Negotiation Period  ) from Tenant, Tenant and Landlord shall negotiate in good faith to determine and mutually
agree upon the Extension Term Rent. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Extension Term Rent during the Negotiation Period, which agreement would be evidenced by an amendment to the Lease executed by both Landlord and Tenant, then
within five (5) days after the last day of the Negotiation Period, Tenant may, by written notice to Landlord (the   Notice of Exercise  ), irrevocably elect to exercise the Extension Option, with the Extension Term Rent to be
determined in accordance with the arbitration procedure set forth below, which determination shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. In the event that Tenant shall fail to deliver the Notice of Exercise on or before five (5) days after the last day
of the Negotiation Period, then Tenant shall have waived any right to exercise the Extension Option. In the event Tenant timely delivers the Notice of Exercise to Landlord, Landlord and Tenant shall each simultaneously present to the other party
their final determinations of the Extension Term Rent (the   Final Offers  ) within ten (10) days after the last day of the Negotiation Period. If the lower of the Final Offers is at least ninety percent (90%) of the higher of the
Final Offers, then the Extension Term Rent shall be determined by averaging the Final Offers. If the lower of the Final Offers is less than ninety percent (90%) of the higher of the Final Offers, then the Extension Term Rent shall be determined by
arbitration, in accordance with the procedure set forth below.        

(f) 
  Arbitration . Arbitration shall follow the following procedures:        

(i) 
 Within ten (10) days after Landlord s receipt of Tenant s Notice of Exercise, Tenant and Landlord shall each select an arbitrator (  Tenant s Arbitrator   and   Landlord s
Arbitrator  , respectively) who shall be a qualified and impartial person licensed in the state where the Building is located as a commercial real estate broker with at least ten (10) years of brokerage experience in the market where the
Building is located.        

(ii) 
 Landlord s Arbitrator and Tenant s Arbitrator shall name a third arbitrator, similarly qualified, within ten (10) days after the appointment of Landlord s Arbitrator and Tenant s Arbitrator.

(iii) 
 The third arbitrator shall, after due consideration of the factors to be taken into account under the definition of Extension Term Rent set forth above, and hearing whatever evidence the arbitrator deems appropriate
from Landlord, Tenant and others, and obtaining any other information the arbitrator deems necessary, in good faith, make its own determination of the Extension Term Rent for the Premises as of the commencement of the Extension Term (the
  Arbitrator s Initial Determination  ) and thereafter select either Landlord s Final Offer or the Tenant s Final Offer, but no other, whichever is closest to the Arbitrator s Initial Determination (the
  Final Determination  ), such determination to be made within twenty (20) days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. The Arbitrator s Initial Determination, Final Determination and the market information upon which such
determinations are based shall be in writing and counterparts thereof shall be delivered to Landlord and Tenant within such twenty (20) day period. The arbitrator shall have no right or ability to determine the Extension Term Rent in any other
manner. The Final Determination shall be binding upon the parties hereto.        

(iv) 
 Landlord and Tenant shall each pay the costs and fees of their respective arbitrators. The actual reasonable costs and fees of the third arbitrator shall be paid by Landlord if the Final Determination shall be
Tenant s Final Offer or by Tenant if the Final Determination shall be Landlord s Final Offer.        

(v) 
 If Tenant fails to appoint Tenant s Arbitrator in the manner and within the time specified above, then the Extension Term Rent shall be the rent contained in the Landlord s Final Offer. If Landlord fails to
appoint Landlord s Arbitrator in the manner and within the time specified above, then the Extension Term Rent shall be the rent contained in the Tenant s Final Offer.    

(g) 
  Extension Option Personal to Tenant . The parties expressly agree that the Extension Option granted to Tenant herein shall be  personal  to Tenant and any transferee not requiring Landlord s
consent. The Extension Option may only be exercised by Tenant; it may not be exercised by any assignee or subtenant of Tenant; and it may not be exercised by Tenant if Tenant is, at the time that the Extension Notice is provided by Tenant to
Landlord, negotiating with Landlord or a potential assignee or subtenant to either assign the Tenant s interest under the Lease or to sublet all or a portion of the Premises.    
      38  

EXHIBIT H   
  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER   
 Tenant shall have the following right of first offer:      

(a) 
  Grant of Right of First Offer . So long as this Lease is in full force and effect; no Default has occurred during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date on which a Notice of Availability, defined below,
would otherwise be forwarded by Landlord to Tenant; and no Default exists, either at the time of exercise of the right set forth herein or on the date the Option Space, as defined below, is to become a part of the Premises, Tenant shall have the
right of first offer (the   Right of First Offer  ) to lease any space on the third (3rd) floor of the Building that is then contiguous to the Premises (the   Option Space  ) if it becomes Available, defined below, on
or after the Commencement Date and during the Option Term, defined below, subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth herein. Tenant s Right of First Offer shall be subject and subordinate to the right of the existing tenant of all or
any portion of the Option Space to renew or otherwise extend the term of its lease for such space, whether such right is granted before or after the Effective Date hereof, and to any other rights of any other parties to lease all or any portion of
the Option Space, if such rights were granted in writing prior to the Effective Date hereof.        

(b) 
  Term of the Right of First Offer . The term of the Right of First Offer (the   Option Term  ) shall commence on the Commencement Date of this Lease, and shall expire the earlier of (i) twenty-four
(24) months prior to the expiration of the Term of this Lease, as the same may be extended by the written agreement of the parties from time to time; (ii) the date on which all portions of the Option Space have been leased by Tenant; or (iii) the
date on which the Right of First Offer is terminated, as provided below.        

(c) 
  Availability of the Option Space . As used herein, the term   Available   shall mean not subject to any lease or any extension or expansion rights; or subject to a lease, and (i) such lease is
scheduled to expire during the Option Term, but no later than twenty-four (24) months following the date on which Landlord s Notice of Availability, defined below, is forwarded to Tenant; (ii) the tenant under such lease has expressly waived
any right to extend the term of such lease beyond its scheduled date of expiration; and (iii) the premises under such lease are not subject to any expansion or other option rights to which Tenant s option rights hereunder are subordinate. If
Landlord becomes aware that all or any portion of the Option Space is or will become Available during the Option Term, then prior to offering such space to a third party to be leased, Landlord shall forward written notice to Tenant (the
  Notice of Availability  ), designating the portion of the Option Space that is Available to be leased by Tenant (the   Offered Space  ). Unless otherwise specified in the Notice of Availability, Tenant shall not have
the right to lease less than the entire amount of the Offered Space.        

(d) 
  Rent Applicable to the Offered Space . Landlord shall include in its Notice of Availability the terms and conditions it would find acceptable for the leasing of the Offered Space by Tenant. Specifically, Landlord
shall specify the proposed term for Tenant s lease of the Option Space, the Base Rent and the Base Year that will be applicable to the Option Space (the   Option Space Rent  ), and the date on which Landlord anticipates that the
Offered Space could be available for Tenant s occupancy, which date shall not be sooner than two (2) business days following Tenant s receipt of the Notice of Availability. The Option Space Rent shall be determined by Landlord, and shall
consist of Landlord s good faith determination of prevailing market rent for the Offered Space at the time the Offered Space would become a part of the Premises, taking into consideration such factors as rental for comparable premises in the
Building; the applicable base year; rental for comparable premises in existing buildings in the same geographical area as the Building (taking into consideration, but not limited to, the use, quality, age and location of the applicable building);
the rentable area of the premises being leased; the length of the pertinent rental term; the quality and creditworthiness of the tenant, and such other factors as Landlord may reasonably determine are relevant.    

(e) 
    Exercise of the Right of First Offer . In the event that Tenant desires to lease the Offered Space, Tenant
shall provide Landlord with notice of its intent to lease the Offered Space in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Landlord s Notice of Availability, by providing Landlord with written notice of such intent ( Tenant s
 Notice of Intent  ) no later than 10 days after Tenant s receipt of Landlord s Notice of Availability. If Tenant does not provide its Notice of Intent to lease the Option Space within the applicable
    
      39  

time period set forth above, then Tenant shall be deemed to have elected not to exercise the Right of First Offer as to the Offered Space, and Landlord shall, during the six (6) month period
following the date on which the Notice of Availability was provided to Tenant, be entitled to market and lease the Option Space to any prospective tenant upon such terms as Landlord may deem appropriate. If, during such six (6) month period,
Landlord leases the Offered Space to a third party, then such Offered Space shall be excluded from the Option Space during the term of such lease, as the same may be extended from time to time; however, if such Offered Space should again become
Available to be leased during the Option Term, such Offered Space shall thereafter again be part of the Option Space. If Landlord does not lease the Offered Space to a third party during such six (6) month period, then such space shall thereafter be
subject to the Right of First Offer.        

(f) 
  Expansion of the Premises . In the event that Tenant provides Landlord with its Notice of Intent to lease the Offered Space in the manner provided above, then, no later than thirty (30) days following
Tenant s receipt of Landlord s Notice of Availability (or ten (10) days following Tenant s receipt of the  Amendment  from Landlord, as provided hereinafter, whichever is later), Landlord and Tenant shall execute an
amendment to this Lease (the   Amendment  ) to be prepared by Landlord documenting the expansion of the Premises to include the Offered Space, which shall be subject to all existing terms of the Lease except as specified in
Landlord s Notice of Availability; the Rent applicable to the Offered Space; and the date on which the Offered Space is to become a part of the Premises        

(g) 
  Right of First Offer Personal to Tenant . The parties expressly agree that the Right of First Offer granted to Tenant herein shall be  personal  to Tenant and any transferee not requiring Landlord s
consent. The Right of First Offer may only be exercised by Tenant; it may not be exercised by any assignee or subtenant of Tenant; and it may not be exercised by Tenant if Tenant is, either at the time the Option Space becomes Available or at the
time the Option Space is to become a part of the Premises, negotiating with Landlord or a potential assignee or subtenant to either assign the Tenant s interest under the Lease or sublet all or a portion of the Premises.
