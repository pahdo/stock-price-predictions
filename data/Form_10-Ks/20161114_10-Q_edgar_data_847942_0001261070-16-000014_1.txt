                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The consolidated interim financial statements included herein, presented
in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and
stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the
Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.

     These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair
presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these
consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
notes thereto included in the Company's 10-K annual report. The Company
follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.

     Results of operations for interim periods are not indicative of annual
results.

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN

The Company has  incurred  net losses of  approximately  $225,000 for the period
from  January 27, 1989 (Inception) through September 30, 2016  and has commenced
limited  operations,  raising  substantial  doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company will seek additional sources of capital
through the issuance of debt or equity financing,  but there can be no assurance
the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.

The  ability of the  Company to  continue  as a going  concern is  dependent  on
additional  sources  of  capital  and the  success of the  Company's  plan.  The
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might be necessary if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial  statements for the nine-month period  ended  September 30, 2016 and
the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

    The Company has limited capital resources and stockholder's equity. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets in the form of cash and cash
equivalents of $3,391 and liabilities of $0.

    The Company has not realized any revenues from operations in the past two
years, and its plan of  operation  for the next twelve  months   shall   be   to
continue to locate a suitable acquisition/merger candidate.  The  Company  can
provide no assurance that it will continue to satisfy its cash requirements for
at least the next twelve  months if a suitable acquisition/merger is completed.

     It is unlikely the Company will have any revenue, other than interest
income, unless it is able to effect an acquisition of or merger with an
operating company, of which there can be no assurance.

     For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company showed net
losses of $2,120 and $2,130, respectively.  The decrease in net loss was due
to a decrease in transfer agent fees, which was partially offset by an increase
in bank fees.

     For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company showed
net losses of $9,499 and $5,924, respectively. The increase in net loss was
primarily due to an increase in auditing fees, along with a change in timing
for payment of such fees, due to a change in the Company's auditor.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls  and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Additionally, the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

     There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting during the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Certification Pursuant to Section 302
                       of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

I, John P. O'Shea, certify that:

1. I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Strategic
   Acquisitions, Inc. (the "Registrant");

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
   of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
   statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
   were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
   information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
   the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
   Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
   procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
   internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
   13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) for the Registrant and have:

   a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
      disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision,
      to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant is made
      known to me by others within the Registrant, particularly during the
      period in which this report is being prepared. The Registrant has no
      consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries;

   b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
      internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my
      supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
      of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
      external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles;

   c) evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and
      procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the
      effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
      the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

   d) disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant's internal control
      over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant's most recent
      fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
      materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
      reporting; and

5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over
   financial reporting, to the Registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
   the Registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
   functions):

   a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
      operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
      reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant's ability to
      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

   b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
      employees who have a significant role in the Registrant's internal
      control over financial reporting.
