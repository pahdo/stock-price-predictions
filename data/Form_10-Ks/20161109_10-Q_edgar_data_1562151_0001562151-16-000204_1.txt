1.      Background and Basis of Presentation 

Background 

Crimson Wine Group, Ltd.   and its subsidiaries   (  collectively,    Crimson    or the  Company   ) is a Delaware corporation   that has been   conducting   business   since 1991  .    Crimson is in the business of producing and selling ultra-premium and luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for   $14   to   $25   and over   $25   per   750  ml bottle, respectively)  .    Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and through its subsidiaries owns   six   wineries:  Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards  ,    Seghesio Family Vineyards  ,     Double Canyon Vineyards   and Seven Hills Winery  . 

Financial Statement Preparation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items or items discussed herein) that management believes necessary to fairly state results of interim operations, should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Significant Accounting Policies   and Recent Accounting Pronouncements  ) included in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for   the year ended December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC on Form 10-K (the  201  5   Report )  .    Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results of operations  .    The   unaudited   condensed consolidated ba  lance sheet at December 31, 2015   was extracted from the audited annual financial statements and does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements  .   

Significant Accounting Policies 

There were no changes to the   Company s significant accounting policies   during the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016  .    See Note 3 to the   201  5   Report for a description of the Company s significant accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements issued   by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )   subsequent to the filing of the 2015 Report that could have a material effect on Crimson s     consolidated   financial statements.   The following table also provides a brief description of recent accounting pronoun  cements adopted during the nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016  :

Date of adoption  

Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters  

Standards that are not yet adopted  

Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2016-08 amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer.  

January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017.  

Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  

Amends certain aspects of ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation.   

January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017.  

Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  

Amends the guidance in Topic 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles on this topic.  

January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted for the Company.  

Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

Standards that were adopted  

ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805)  

The standard eliminates the requirement for retrospective treatment of measurement-period adjustments in a business combination. Instead, a measurement-period adjustment will be recognized in the period in which the adjustment is determined.   

January 1, 2016.  

The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU 2015-05, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)  

Cloud computing arrangements represent the delivery of hosted services over the internet which includes software, platforms, infrastructure and other hosting arrangements. The ASU provides criteria to determine whether the cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. A software license can include customized development, maintenance, hosting and other related costs. If the criteria are met, the customer will capitalize the fee attributable to the software license portion of the arrangement as internal-use software. If the arrangement does not include a software license, it should be treated as a service contract.   

January 1, 2016.  

The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

2.      Acquisition of Seven Hills Winery 

On January 27, 2016,   one   of Crimson s wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into     a purchase agreement     pursuant to which Crimson s subsidiary acquired, or has rights in, substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities with respect to the Seven Hills Winery located in Walla Walla, Washington  .    The acquisition provides a strategic opportunity for Crimson to expand its portfolio  . 

The ac  quisition-date fair value of total   consideration for the Seven Hills     Winery acquisition   was   $7.9     million, consisting of     $7.  3     million in cash,   which included    a     working capital adjustment   of     $0.3     million, and     $0.6   million of   non-cash   contingent cons  ideration.   The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay up to     $0.8     million in future earn-out payments based on certain achievements of the acquired business over the     38     months following the closing of the     acquisition  .    The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration   at January 27, 2016 (the acquisition date) to be $0.6 million,   using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820,     Fair Value Measurement  .    Changes to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at each   reporting period shall be   recorded in   the Company s consolidated income statement under   the line item entitled    General and administrative expense    as an operating expense  .    The fair value of the contingent   consideration   as of   September   30  , 2016 was   $0.6   million and during the three   and nine months ended September   30  , 2016 the amount  s   recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated income statement  s   related to the change  s   in the estimated fair value   of the contingent liability were   immaterial. 

6   

The Seven Hills     Winery     acquisition was   recorded during the first quarter of 2016 using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed under ASC 805,   Business Combinations  . Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed w  ere     recorded at their fair values     estimated by management as of     January 27, 2016  .    The Company is in the process of finalizing fair value measurements of certain assets; thus, the measurements are subject to change.    

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date     (in thousands):  

The fair value of accounts receiv  able acquired of $0.2 million was   equal to the gross contractual amount due   as of the acquisition date   as the Company expect  ed to collect, and has subsequently collected, on all amounts. 

Adjustments to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value     include the recognition of $  0.6     million of intangible assets as follows     (in thousands, except estimated life information): 

As described in Note 1  1      Business Segment Information,  based on the nature of the Company s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments  .    Therefore, goodwill recognized has not been allocated to any particular segment of the Company. 

The   Company   recognized     $0.  2   million   of acquisition related costs   during the nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  . These costs are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated income statement  s   under the line item entitled  General and administrative expense.  The Company s results for the three   and nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 include the results of Seven Hills   Winery for the period since the date of acquisition.     The amount of revenue and net   income   included in the Company s unaudited   condensed consolidated income statement  s     for the thr  ee months ended September   30,   2016 were     $0.  3   million and   $0.  1   million, respectively, and   revenue and net loss   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016   w  ere     $  1.3   million and     $0.  1   million,   respectively.    

In connection with   the acquisition  , the   fair value in excess   of book value for certain inventory on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up.   Seven Hills Winery s cost of goods sold   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include  s inventory step-up.  

Pro forma financial statements are not presented as they are not material to the Company s overall   condensed   consolidated   financial statements.

5  .      Financial Instruments 

The Company s material financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and investments classified as available for sale  .    I  nvestments classified as available for sale   are   the only assets or liabilities that are measured at f  air value on a recurring basis.   All of the Company s investments mature within   three   years or less.

The par value, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair value of investments classified as available for sale as of   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,   other than the assets and liabilities related to the Seven Hills Winery acquisition (see Note 2),   the Company did not have any   assets   or   liabilities   measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.     For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their fair values  .    For short-term and long-term debt, the carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their fair values  .    The Company has estimated the fair value of its short-term and long-term debt based upon Level 3 inputs, such as the terms that management believes would currently be available to the Company for similar issues of debt, taking into account the current credit risk of the Company and other factors. 

The Company does not invest in any derivatives or engage in any hedging activities.

Revolving Credit Facility 

In March 2013, Crimson     and its subsidiaries     entered into a     $60.0     million     revolving credit facility with American AgCredit, FLCA, as agent for the lenders identified in the revolving credit facility, comprised of a revolving loan facility and a term revolving loan facility, which together is secured by substantially all of Crimson s assets  .    The revolving credit facility is for up to     $10.0     million     of availability in the aggregate for a     five     year term, and the term revolving credit facility is for up to     $50.0     million     in the aggregate for a     fifteen     year term  .    All obligations of Crimson under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by certain real property, including vineyards and certain winery facilities of Crimson, accounts receivable, inventory and intangible     assets  .    In addition to unused line fees ranging from     0.  1  5%     to     0.2  5%  , rates for the borrowings are priced based on a performance grid tied to certain financial ratios and the London Interbank Offered Rate.     The revolving credit facility can be used to fund acquisitions, capital projects and other general corporate purposes  .    Covenants include the maintenance of specified debt and equity ratios, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, limitations on dividends and other distributions to shareholders and restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations and sales of assets  .    No     amounts have been borrowed under the     revolving credit     facility to date.  

Term Loan 

On November 10, 2015, Pine Ridge Winery, LLC ( Borrower ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of     Crimson  ,     entered into a senior secured term loan agreement (the  term loan ) with American AgCredit, FLCA ( Lender ) for an aggregate principal amount of     $16.0     million. Amounts outstanding under the     term loan     will bear a fixed interest rate of     5.24%     per annum. 

The     term loan     will mature on     October 1, 2040     (the  Maturity Date ). On the first day of each January, April, July and October, commencing January 1, 2016, a principal payment in the amount of     $160,000     and an interest payment equal to the amount of all interest accrued through the previous day shall be made. A final payment of all unpaid principal, interest and any other charges with respect to the     term loan     shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 

The Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately   $0.1     million related to this term loan. These costs are recorded as a reduction from short-term or long-term debt, based on the timeframe in which the fees will be expensed (i.e.   expensed within 12-months shall be classified against short-term debt). The costs are     being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the loan.    

Borrower s obligations under the     term loan     are     guaranteed by the Company.     All     obligations of Borrower under the     term loan     are collateralized by certain real property of the Company. Borrower s covenants include the maintenance of a specified debt service coverage ratio and certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness; limitations on distributions to shareholders; and restrictions on certain investments, sale of assets and merging or consolidating with other persons. 

The full     $16.0     million was drawn at closing and the     term loan     can be used to fund acquisitions, capital projects and other general corporate purposes.     As of   September   30  , 2016,   $15.  4   million in principal was outstanding, net of unamortized loan fees of     less than   $0.1     million. 

The Company     was     in     compliance with all debt covenants as of   September   30  , 2016. 

9.      Stockholders  Equity

The Company s ef  fective tax rates for the three   months ended     September 30  , 2016 and 2015   were     39.9  %   and   43.0  %  , respectively.   The Company s   effective tax rates for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015 were   41.3  %   and     38.9  %  , respectively.   The consolidated income tax expense for the three     and nine     months ended     September   30  , 2016 and 2015   was determined based upon estimates of the Company s consolidated effective income tax rates for the years ending December 31, 2016     and 2015, respectively. The difference between the consolidated effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is primarily attributable to   state taxes and permanent items  , which primarily consist of meals and entertainment and the domestic production activity deduction  . 

The Company does not have any amounts in its   condensed   consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits related to   uncertain tax positions at   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 2015  .    

11.      Business Segment Information 

The Company has identified     two     operating segments which are reportable segments for financial statement reporting purposes, Wholesale Sales and Direct to Consumer Sales, based upon their different distribution channels, margins and selling strategies  .    Wholesale Sales includes all sales through a third party where prices are given at a wholesale rate whereas Direct to Consumer Sales includes retail sales in the t  asting room, remote sites and   on-site events, Wine Club sales and other sales made directly to the consumer without     the use of an intermediary  .      

The two s  egments reflect how the Company   s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are allocated accordingly. However, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available  .    Based on the nature of the Company s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments  .    Therefore, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated. 

The following table outlines the net sales, cost of sales   including inventory   step  -  up associated with   the Seven Hills Winery acquisition  , gross profit, directly attributable selling expenses and operating income for the Company s reportable segments for the three   and nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015, and also includes a reconciliation of consolidated income (loss) from operations. Other/Non-allocable net sales and gross profit include bulk wine and grape sales, event fees and retail sales. Other/Non-allocable expenses include centralized corporate expenses not specific to an identified reporting segment  .    Sales figures are net of related excise taxes.

Overview     of Business 

The Company generates revenues from sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers, sales of bulk wine and grapes, special event fees, tasting fees and retail sales.  

Our wines are primarily sold to wholesale distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants  .    As permitted under federal and local regulations, we have also been placing increased emphasis on generating revenue from direct sales to consumers which occur through wine clubs, at the wineries  tasting rooms and through the internet and direct outreach to customers. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for the Company as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price sold to distributors. From time to time, we may sell grapes or bulk wine, because the wine does not  

14   

meet the quality standards for the Company s products, market conditions have changed resulting in reduced demand for certain products, or because the Company may have produced more of a particular varietal than it can use  .    When these sales occur, they may result in a loss. 

Cost of sales includes grape and bulk wine costs, whether purchased or produced from the Company s controlled vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling and packaging, warehousing  ,   shipping and handling costs   and inventory step-up costs in connection with   the acquisition of Seven Hills Winery  . For the Company controlled vineyard produced grapes, grape costs include annual farming labor costs, harvest costs and depreciation of vineyard assets. For wines that age longer than one year, winemaking and processing costs continue to be incurred and capitalized to the cost of wine, which can range from 3 to 36 months. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are also included in costs of sales. 

At   September   30  , 2016, wine in  ventory includes   approximately   1.0   million cases   of bottled and bulk wine in various stages of the aging process  .    Cased wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 36 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage. 

Seasonality 

As discussed in the 201  5   Report,   the wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. The Company typically has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing  .    We     anticipate similar trends in the future. 

Items impacting comparability 

In connection with   the acquisition of Seven Hills Winery  , the   fair value in excess   of book value for certain inventory on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired company prior to acquisition.   The Company s cost of goods sold   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include  s the following inventory step-up related to Seven Hills Winery.  

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended   September   30  , 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended   September   30  , 2015 

Net Sales 

Wholesale net sales increased $  0.  2     million, or 3  %, in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   201  5  .     The increase in the current     quarter     was   driven by   domestic   volume     growth of   7  %  ,     partially offset by   a     decrease   in   export   volume of   12%,   increased price   support   and   a   temporary shift     in product mix to     lower priced products. 

15   

Direct to consumer net sales     increased $1.0 million, or 23  %,   in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  .    I  n the current   quarter   wine club   net sales increase  d   $0.8 million and   e-commerce  ,   special events   and tasting room   combined net sales increased $0.  2   million  .    

Other net sales include bulk wine and grape sales, event fees and reta  il sales which   had an overall increase of $0.  6 million, or 47  %, in   the current quarter as compared to the same period in     201  5  . The year over year in  crease was primarily driven     by a     higher volume of   higher   priced   bulk wine   and grape   sales. 

Gross Profit 

Whole  sale gross profit   remained relatively flat     in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Gross margin percentage, which is defined as gross profit   as a percentage of net sales, de  creased approximately   144     basis points   in the current   quarter  , which was     driven     primarily by     a    temporary     shift in product mix to lower margin     products   and expected lower ma  rgins on   the inventory purchased in the   Seven Hills Wine  ry     acquisition   due to fair value   acquisition related   accounting  .     P  rice increases   through   the   remainder of the   year   on certain products  ,    as well as improved mix of higher margin products  ,   are expected to     improve margins   in   the remainder of   the year  .           

Direct to consumer g  ross profit in  creased $  0.  6     million, or 18  %,   in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  . Gross margin percentage   de  creased approximately   271     basis points in the current period  , which was     driven   primarily   by   an overall expected shift in product mix to lower margin products   and expected lower ma  rgins on   the inventory purchased in the   Seven Hills Wine  ry     acquisition   due to fair value   acquisition related   accounting  .    We anticipate   higher margins   for   the   remainder   of the year as   the mix of our   wine clubs shifts to the higher   value   and margin   items. 

Other gross profit includes bulk wine and grape sales, event fees, non-wine retail sales and inventory write-downs which reflected an   overall     in  crease of $0.  4   milli  on, or 99  %,   in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  . The overall in  crease was primarily   driven by     higher margin  s recognized   on   non-wine retail sales   and   improved margins   on   a    higher volume   of   bulk wine   and grape   sales  . 

Operating Expenses 

Sales and m  arketing expenses increased $0.6   mil  lion, or 17  %,   in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase was     primaril  y to support   growth,   partially due to   the addition of the Estates Wine Room in December 2015 and the acquisition of Seven Hills Winery in January 2016,   which resulted in higher compensation costs   and     increased office related expenses   and marketing costs  . 

General and administrative   expenses   decreased $0.1 million, or 4%, in the current quarter   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    The     decrease was primarily driven by decreased     contract services  , legal fees  , o  ffice related expenses   and several     other     general and administrative items  . These decreases were partially offset by   increased     compensation   costs  ,    licensing   and permit fees     and   depreciation  .   

16   

Other Income (Expense) 

Interest expen  s  e increased $0.2 million, or 513  %,   in     the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  .    The increase   primarily   relates to interest expense incurred on the term loan entered into with     American AG Credit     during November 2015. 

Other income increased $0.1   million, or 347  %,   in   the current quarter as compared to the same period in   2015  .    The     overall in  crease in     other     income   primarily   relates     to   increased interest income on our short-term investments   and increased net rental property income  .   

Income Tax   Provision 

The Company s effective tax rates for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 20  15 were 39.9  % and   43.0  %, respectively. The effective tax rate   for the   third   quarter of 2016 de  creased compared to the   same period in   2015 primarily   due to an increased domestic production activities deduction. 

Nine   Months Ended   September   30  , 2016 Compared to   Nine     Months Ended   September   30  , 2015 

Net Sales 

W  h  olesale net sales increased $1.9 million, or 7  %, in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  . The increase in the current year was driven by   domestic volume growth   of 10  %,   export volume   growth of   4% and decreased price support.   These increases were partially offset by   a    temporary shift     in product mix to     lower priced products during the current period. 

Direct to consumer net sales increased $0.9 million, or 6%, in the current nine-month period as compared to the same period in 2015. In the current period wine club, e-commerce and special events combined net sales increased $0.5 million and tasting room net sales increased $0.4 million. 

Other net sales include bulk wine and grape sales, event fees and retail sales whic  h had an overall increase of $1.4   million, or   54  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  . The year over year increase was primarily driven by a   higher volume of   higher priced   bulk wine   and grape   sales. 

Gross Profit 

Wholesale gross profit decreased $0.  2   million, or   1  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  .    Gross   margin percentage     decreased approximately   397     basis points in the current   period  ,   which was driven primarily by a   shift in product mix to   lower margin product  s  ,   including the close out of   lower priced and lower margin wine  s  , and expected lower ma  rgins on   the inventory purchased in the   Seven Hills Wine  ry     acquisition   due to fair value   acquisition related   accounting  .    P  rice  

17   

increases   through the remainder of the year   on certain products  ,    as well as improved mix of higher margin products  ,   are expected to     improve margins   in the remainder of   the year  . 

Di  rect to consumer gross profit in  creased $0.  2     million, or 2  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  . Gross margin percentage decreased approximately   25  3     basis points in the   current period,   which was     driven primarily by   an overall expected shift in product mix to lower margin products     and expected lower ma  rgins on   the inventory purchased in the   Seven Hills Wine  ry     acquisition   due to fair value   acquisition related   accounting  .    We anticipate higher margins   in the   remainder of   the year when the mix of our   wine clubs shifts to the higher   value   and margin     items. 

Other gross profit includes bulk wine and grape sales, event fees, non-wine retail sales and inventory write-downs which reflected an   overall     in  crease of $  0.3   million   or   84  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  . The overall   in  crease was primarily   driven by higher margins recognized on   non-wine retail sales and   improved margins   on   a higher volume of bulk wine and grape sales  . 

Operating Expenses 

Sales and m  arketing expenses increased $1.  9   mil  lion, or 18  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  . The increase was     primaril  y to support growth, partially due to the addition of the Estates Wine Room in December 2015 and the acquisition of Seven Hills Winery in January 2016,   which resulted in   increased   compensation costs  ,     promotion and incentive related costs,   office related expenses   and     professional fees  . These increases were     partially offset by     a    decrease in   outside services and   public relations special programs  .    

General and administrative   expenses     increased $0.  5   mil  lion, or 6  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  .    The increase was primarily     driven by operating expenses and   one-time   acquisition related professional fees associated with Seven Hills Winery,     increased   compensation, outside services   and     depreciation  .    These increases   were   partially   offset by    a    d  ecrease   in     office related expenses   and   several other general and administrative items  . 

Other Income (Expense) 

Interest expen  se increased $0.6   million, or   496  %,   in the current   nine  -month period as compared to the same period in 201  5  .    The increase relates to interest expense incurred on the term loan entered into with     American AG Credit     during November 2015. 

Other income, net   increased $0.1 million, or 53%, in the current nine-month period as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase primarily related to   interest income   on our short-term investments   and increased net rental property income  . 

Income Tax Provision 

The Company s effective   annual   tax rates for the   nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015 were   41.3  % and 3  8.9  %, respectively.   The effective tax rate increased in   the   current period   as   compared to   same period in   2015 primarily   due to a decrease in the   domestic production activities deduction.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

The Company s principal sources of liquidity are its available cash, funds generated from operations and its revolving credit facility. The Company s primary cash needs are to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures.  

Credit Facilities 

In March 2013, Crimson entered into a $60.0 million     revolving credit facility with American AgCredit, FLCA, as agent for the lenders identified in the revolving credit facility, comprised of a revolving loan facility and a term revolving loan facility, which together is secured by substant  ially all of Crimson s assets.   The revolving credit facility is for up to $10.0 million     of availability in the aggregate for a five year term, and the term revolving credit facility is for up to $50.0 million     in the aggr  egate for a fifteen year term.   All obligations of Crimson under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by certain real property, including vineyards and certain winery facilities of Crimson, accounts receivab  le, inventory and intangible assets  .    In addition to unused line fees ranging from 0.  15% to 0.2  5%, rates for the borrowings are priced based on a performance grid tied to certain financial ratios and the London Interbank Offered Rate. The revolving credit facility can be used to fund acquisitions, capital projects and other general corporate purposes. Covenants include the maintenance of specified debt and equity ratios, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, limitations on dividends and other distributions to shareholders and restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations and sales of assets.     No amounts have been borrowed under the     revolving credit     facility to date.  

On November 10, 2015, Pine Ridge Winery, LLC ( Borrower ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of     Crimson     entered into a senior secured term loan agreement (the  term loan ) with American AgCredit, FLCA ( Lender ) for an aggregate principal amount of     $16.0     million. Amounts outstanding under the term loan will bear a fixed interest rate of     5.24%     per annum. 

The term loan will mature on October 1, 2040 (the  Maturity Date ). On the first day of each January, April, July and October, commencing     January 1, 2016,  Borrower is required to make     a principal payment in the amount of One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) and an interest payment equal to the amount of all interest accrued through the previous day. A final payment of all unpaid principal, interest and any other charges with respect to the term loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 

Borrower s obligations under the term loan are guaranteed by the Company.     All     obligations of Borrower under the term loan are collateralized by certain real property of the Company. Borrower s covenants include the maintenance of a specified debt service coverage ratio and certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness; limitations on distributions to shareholders; and restrictions on certain investments, sale of assets and merging or consolidating with other persons. 

The full     $16.0     million was drawn at closing and the     term loan     can be used to fund acquisitions, capital projects and other general corporate purposes.   As of   September 30  , 2016,   $15.  4   million in principal was outstanding, net of unamortized loan fees of     less than   $0.1     million.

The     change     in     operating assets and liabilities     was primarily   due to     a  n     in  crease in   inventory and other current assets  ,    partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and expense accruals   and customer deposits  .

The term loan had $15.  5   million outstanding at   September   30  , 2016, and is a fixed-rate debt, and therefore is not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates.
