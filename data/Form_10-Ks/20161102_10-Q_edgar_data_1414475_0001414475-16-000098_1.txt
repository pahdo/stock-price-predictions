1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

General.   Western Gas Partners, LP is a growth-oriented Delaware master limited partnership ( MLP ) formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in 2007 to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream energy assets.  
  For purposes of these consolidated financial statements, the  Partnership  refers to Western Gas Partners, LP and its subsidiaries. The Partnership s general partner, Western Gas Holdings, LLC (the  general partner ), is owned by Western Gas Equity Partners, LP ( WGP ), a Delaware MLP formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in September 2012 to own the Partnership s general partner, as well as a significant limited partner interest in the Partnership (see   Western Gas Equity Partners, LP   below). WGP has no independent operations or material assets other than owning the partnership interests in WES (see   Holdings of Partnership equity   in   Note 4  ). Western Gas Equity Holdings, LLC is WGP s general partner and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.  Anadarko  refers to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding the Partnership and the general partner, and  affiliates  refers to subsidiaries of Anadarko, excluding the Partnership, but including equity interests in Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC ( Fort Union ), White Cliffs Pipeline, LLC ( White Cliffs ), Rendezvous Gas Services, LLC ( Rendezvous ), Enterprise EF78 LLC (the  Mont Belvieu JV ), Texas Express Pipeline LLC ( TEP ), Texas Express Gathering LLC ( TEG ) and Front Range Pipeline LLC ( FRP ). The interests in TEP, TEG and FRP are referred to collectively as the  TEFR Interests.  The  MGR assets  include the Red Desert complex and the Granger straddle plant. 
  The Partnership is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, compressing, treating and transporting natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil for Anadarko, as well as for third-party producers and customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership s assets and investments accounted for under the equity method consisted of the following:

These assets and investments are located in the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Utah and Wyoming), the Mid-Continent (Kansas and Oklahoma), North-central Pennsylvania and Texas. The Partnership commenced operation of Train IV in May 2016 and Train V in October 2016, both of which are processing plants at the DBM complex. The Partnership has also made progress payments toward the construction of another cryogenic unit at the DBM complex ( Train VI ). The Partnership is evaluating when construction of Train VI will start and believes the earliest the plant may come online is the fourth quarter of 2017.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 
    
  Basis of presentation.   The following table outlines the Partnership s ownership interests and the accounting method of consolidation used in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements: 

(1)   
    Investments in non-controlled entities over which the Partnership exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.  Equity investment throughput  refers to the Partnership s share of average throughput for these investments. 
               (2)   
    The Partnership proportionately consolidates its associated share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses attributable to these assets. 
               (3)   
    The   25%   interest in Chipeta Processing LLC ( Chipeta ) held by a third-party member is reflected within noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. 
       
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  
  In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, using historical experience and other methods considered reasonable. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations resulting from revisions to estimates are recognized when the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. The information furnished herein reflects all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements, and certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. 
  Certain information and note disclosures commonly included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s 2015 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016, certain sections of which were recast to reflect the results of the Springfield interest in the Partnership s Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on June 10, 2016. Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 
    
  Presentation of Partnership assets.   The term  Partnership assets  refers to the assets owned and interests accounted for under the equity method (see   Note 7  ) by the Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  . Because Anadarko controls the Partnership through its ownership and control of WGP, which owns the Partnership s entire general partner interest, each acquisition of Partnership assets from Anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As such, the Partnership assets acquired from Anadarko were initially recorded at Anadarko s historic carrying value, which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by the Partnership. Further, after an acquisition of Partnership assets from Anadarko, the Partnership may be required to recast its financial statements to include the activities of such Partnership assets from the date of common control. See   Note 2  . 
  For those periods requiring recast, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Partnership s acquisition of the Partnership assets from Anadarko have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if the Partnership had owned the Partnership assets during the periods reported. Net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership assets acquired from Anadarko for periods prior to the Partnership s acquisition of the Partnership assets is not allocated to the limited partners. 
    
  Insurance recoveries.   Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to fire). Some of these events are insurable and result in property damage insurance recovery. Amounts the Partnership receives from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. The Partnership records a receivable from insurance to the extent it recognizes a loss from an involuntary conversion event and the likelihood of recovering such loss is deemed probable. To the extent that any of the Partnership s insurance claim receivables are later judged not probable of recovery (e.g., due to new information), such amounts are expensed. The Partnership recognizes gains on involuntary conversions when the amount received from insurance exceeds the net book value of the retired asset(s). In addition, the Partnership does not recognize a gain related to insurance recoveries until all contingencies related to such proceeds have been resolved, that is, a non-refundable cash payment is received from the insurance carrier or the Partnership has a binding settlement agreement with the carrier that clearly states that a non-refundable payment will be made. To the extent that an asset is rebuilt, the associated expenditures are capitalized, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and presented as capital expenditures in the Partnership s consolidated statements of cash flows. With respect to business interruption insurance claims, the Partnership recognizes income only when non-refundable cash proceeds are received from insurers, which are presented in the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations as a component of Operating income (loss).  
  On December 3, 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. The majority of the damage from the incident was to the liquid handling facilities and the amine treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of   100   MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains and is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of   200   MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and returned to full service in May 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , and December 31, 2015, the consolidated balance sheets include receivables of   $28.8 million   and   $49.0 million  , respectively, for a property insurance claim related to the incident at the DBM complex. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had received   $34.7 million   in cash proceeds from insurers related to the incident at the DBM complex, including   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and   $18.4 million   in proceeds from property insurance claims.

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-06,   Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions  . This ASU provides guidance for the presentation of historical earnings per unit for MLPs that apply the two-class method of calculating earnings per unit. When a general partner transfers or  drops down  net assets to an MLP, the transaction is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, and the statements of operations are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the transaction. This ASU specifies that the historical earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner, and the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners should not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. The ASU also requires additional disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method. The Partnership applies the two-class method of calculating earnings per unit as described above (including the allocation of pre-acquisition net income (loss) to the general partner), and discloses the rights to earnings (losses) noted above. As such, there was no impact to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2016. 
  ASU 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   and ASU 2015-15,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  . These ASUs require capitalized debt issuance costs, except for those related to revolving credit facilities, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. The Partnership adopted these ASUs on January 1, 2016, using a retrospective approach. The adoption resulted in a reclassification that reduced Other assets and Long-term debt by   $16.7 million   on the Partnership s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. See   Note 9  . 
  ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . This ASU amends existing requirements applicable to reporting entities that are required to evaluate consolidation of a legal entity under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) or voting interest entity models. The provisions will affect how limited partnerships and similar entities are assessed for consolidation, including an additional requirement that a limited partnership will be a VIE unless the limited partners have either substantive kick-out or participating rights over the general partner. The Partnership evaluated the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and determined it does not have any entities for which it is the primary beneficiary for accounting and disclosure purposes. As such, the adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2016, did not impact the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  New accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.   ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . This ASU requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . This ASU provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach if practicable, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   This ASU requires the lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about their leasing transactions. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2019. The Partnership is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This ASU supersedes current revenue recognition requirements. The codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Partnership is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Partnership is continuing to evaluate the provisions of this ASU and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or decided upon the method of adoption.

2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
    
  The following table presents the acquisitions completed by the Partnership during   2016   and   2015  , and identifies the funding sources for such acquisitions: 

(1)   
    The Partnership acquired Delaware Basin JV Gathering LLC ( DBJV ) from Anadarko. DBJV owns a   50%   interest in a gathering system and related facilities. The DBJV gathering system and related facilities (the  DBJV system ) are located in the Delaware Basin in Loving, Ward, Winkler and Reeves Counties, Texas. The Partnership will make a cash payment on March 31, 2020, to Anadarko as consideration for the acquisition of DBJV. At the acquisition date, the Partnership estimated the future payment would be   $282.8 million  , the net present value of which was   $174.3 million  . For further information, including revisions to the estimated future payment, see   DBJV acquisition deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko   below.  
               (2)   
    The Partnership acquired Springfield Pipeline LLC ( Springfield ) from Anadarko for   $750.0 million  , consisting of   $712.5 million   in cash and the issuance of   1,253,761   of the Partnership s common units. Springfield owns a   50.1%   interest in an oil gathering system and a gas gathering system, such interest being referred to in this report as the  Springfield interest.  The Springfield oil and gas gathering systems (collectively, the  Springfield system ) are located in Dimmit, La Salle, Maverick and Webb Counties in South Texas. The Partnership financed the cash portion of the acquisition through: (i) borrowings of   $247.5 million   on the Partnership s senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( RCF ), (ii) the issuance of   835,841   of the Partnership s common units to WGP and (iii) the issuance of Series A Preferred units to private investors. See   Note 4   for further information regarding the Series A Preferred units. 
       
  Springfield acquisition  .   Because the acquisition of Springfield was a transfer of net assets between entities under common control, the Partnership s historical financial statements and operational data previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form   10-Q   to include the results attributable to the Springfield interest as if the Partnership owned Springfield for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Partnership s acquisition of Springfield have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if the Partnership had owned Springfield during the periods reported. 
  The following table presents the impact of the Springfield interest on Revenues and other and Net income (loss) as presented in the Partnership s historical consolidated statements of operations:

2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED) 
    
  DBJV acquisition - deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.     The consideration to be paid by the Partnership for the acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment to Anadarko due on March 31, 2020. The cash payment will be equal to (a) eight multiplied by the average of the Partnership s share in the Net Earnings (see definition below) of DBJV for the calendar years 2018 and 2019, less (b) the Partnership s share of all capital expenditures incurred for DBJV between March 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. Net Earnings is defined as all revenues less cost of product, operating expenses and property taxes, in each case attributable to DBJV on an accrual basis. As of the acquisition date, the estimated future payment obligation (based on management s estimate of the Partnership s share of forecasted Net Earnings and capital expenditures for DBJV) was   $282.8 million  , which had a net present value of   $174.3 million  , using a discount rate of   10%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Partnership recognized an aggregate   $259.9 million   decrease in the estimated future payment obligation, resulting in a net present value of   $16.4 million   for this obligation at   September 30, 2016  , calculated using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% discount rate. The reduction in the value of the deferred purchase price obligation is primarily due to revisions reflecting a decrease in the Partnership s estimate of 2018 and 2019 Net Earnings and an increase in the Partnership s estimate of aggregate capital expenditures to be incurred by DBJV through February 29, 2020. 
  The following table summarizes the financial statement impact of the Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko: 

(1)   
    Accretion expense was recorded as a charge to Interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
               (2)   
    Interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes financing-related accretion revisions of   $(1.2) million   and   $(12.1) million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
               (3)   
    Recorded as revisions within Common units on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of equity and partners  capital. 
       
  Assets held for sale - Hugoton system.   During the third quarter of 2016, the Hugoton system, located in Southwest Kansas and Oklahoma, satisfied criteria to be considered held for sale. The assets were remeasured to their current fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement, resulting in a loss of   $6.2 million   at September 30, 2016, recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2016, the Partnership s consolidated balance sheet included long-term assets of   $65.6 million   and long-term liabilities of   $8.4 million   associated with assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed on October 31, 2016.

3.  PARTNERSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS 
    
  The partnership agreement requires the Partnership to distribute all of its available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within   45   days of the end of each quarter. The Board of Directors of the general partner declared the following cash distributions to the Partnership s common and general partner unitholders for the periods presented: 

(1)   
    The Board of Directors of the Partnership s general partner declared a cash distribution to the Partnership s unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.845   per unit, or   $166.7 million   in aggregate, including incentive distributions, but excluding distributions on Class C units (see   Class C unit distributions   below) and Series A Preferred units (see   Series A Preferred unit distributions   below). The cash distribution is payable on   November 10, 2016  , to unitholders of record at the close of business on   October 31, 2016  . 
       
  Class C unit distributions.   The Class C units receive quarterly distributions at a rate equivalent to the Partnership s common units. The distributions are paid in the form of additional Class C units ( PIK Class C units ) until the scheduled conversion date on December 31, 2017 (unless earlier converted), and the Class C units are disregarded with respect to distributions of the Partnership s available cash until they are converted to common units. The number of additional PIK Class C units to be issued in connection with a distribution payable on the Class C units is determined by dividing the corresponding distribution attributable to the Class C units by the volume-weighted-average price of the Partnership s common units for the ten days immediately preceding the payment date for the common unit distribution, less a   6%   discount. The Partnership records the PIK Class C unit distributions at fair value at the time of issuance. This Level 2 fair value measurement uses the Partnership s unit price as a significant input in the determination of the fair value. The Partnership made distributions to APC Midstream Holdings, LLC ( AMH ), the holder of the Class C units, of (i)   214,416   PIK Class C units in August 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended June 30, 2016, (ii)   210,562   PIK Class C units in May 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended March 31, 2016, and (iii)   323,584   PIK Class C units in February 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended December 31, 2015.

3.  PARTNERSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS (CONTINUED) 
    
  Series A Preferred unit distributions.   As further described in   Note 4  , the Partnership issued Series A Preferred units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership to private investors in March 2016 and April 2016. The Series A Preferred unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash equal to   $0.68   per Series A Preferred unit, subject to certain adjustments. The holders of the Series A Preferred units are entitled to certain rights that are senior to the rights of holders of common and Class C units, such as rights to distributions and rights upon liquidation of the Partnership. No payment or distribution on any junior equity security of the Partnership, including common and Class C units, for any quarter is permitted prior to the payment in full of the Series A Preferred unit distribution (including any outstanding arrearages). For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Series A Preferred unitholders will receive an aggregate cash distribution of   $14.9 million   (to be paid in November 2016). For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Series A Preferred unitholders received an aggregate cash distribution of   $14.1 million   (paid in August 2016) comprised of a quarterly per unit distribution prorated for the   77  -day period   7,892,220   Series A Preferred units were outstanding during the second quarter of 2016 and a full quarterly per unit distribution on 14,030,611 Series A Preferred units. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Series A Preferred unitholders received an aggregate cash distribution of   $1.9 million   (paid in May 2016), based on the quarterly per unit distribution prorated for the   18  -day period   14,030,611   Series A Preferred units were outstanding during the first quarter of 2016. See   Note 4   for further discussion of the Series A Preferred units. 

4.  EQUITY AND PARTNERS  CAPITAL 
    
  Equity offerings.   Pursuant to the Partnership s registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2014 authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of   $500.0 million   of common units ( $500.0 million COP ), during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership issued   873,525   common units, at an average price of   $66.61  , generating proceeds of   $57.4 million   (net of   $0.8 million   for the underwriting discount and other offering expenses). Net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Gross proceeds generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $58.2 million  . Commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $0.6 million  . The Partnership issued   no   common units under the $500.0 million COP during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Class C units.   In connection with the closing of the DBM acquisition in November 2014, the Partnership issued   10,913,853   Class C units to AMH at a price of   $68.72   per unit, generating proceeds of   $750.0 million  , pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement ( UPA ) with Anadarko and AMH. All outstanding Class C units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis on December 31, 2017, unless the Partnership elects to convert such units earlier or Anadarko extends the conversion date. The Class C units were issued to partially fund the acquisition of DBM, and the UPA contains an optional redemption feature that provides the Partnership the ability to redeem up to   $150.0 million   of the Class C units within 10 days of the receipt of cash proceeds from an entity that is not an affiliate of the Partnership or AMH, if these cash proceeds were in relation to (i) the assets of DBM, (ii) the equity interests in DBM or (iii) the equity interests in a subsidiary of the Partnership that owns a majority of the outstanding equity interests in DBM. As of   September 30, 2016  , no such proceeds had been received, and no Class C units had been redeemed. 
  The Class C units were issued at a discount to the then-current market price of the common units into which they are convertible. This discount, totaling   $34.8 million  , represents a beneficial conversion feature, and at issuance, it was reflected as an increase in common unitholders  capital and a decrease in Class C unitholder capital to reflect the fair value of the Class C units at issuance. The beneficial conversion feature is considered a non-cash distribution that will be recognized from the date of issuance through the date of conversion, resulting in an increase in Class C unitholder capital and a decrease in common unitholders  capital as amortized. The beneficial conversion feature is amortized assuming a conversion date of December 31, 2017, using the effective yield method. The impact of the beneficial conversion feature amortization is also included in the calculation of earnings per unit.

4.  EQUITY AND PARTNERS  CAPITAL (CONTINUED) 
    
  Series A Preferred units.   In connection with the closing of the Springfield acquisition on March 14, 2016, the Partnership issued   14,030,611   Series A Preferred units (the  March 2016 Series A units ) to private investors for a cash purchase price of   $32.00   per unit, generating proceeds of   $440.0 million   (net of fees and expenses, including a   2.0%   transaction fee paid to the private investors). In April 2016, the Partnership issued an additional   7,892,220   Series A Preferred units (the  April 2016 Series A units ) pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance, generating net proceeds of   $246.9 million  . The Series A Preferred unitholders may convert the Series A Preferred units into common units on a   one  -for-one basis at any time after the second anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. Similarly, the Partnership may convert the Series A Preferred units at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, if the closing price of the Partnership s common units is greater than   $48.00   per common unit for 20 of the 30 preceding trading days, and subject to other certain conversion thresholds. In addition, upon certain events involving a change of control, the Series A Preferred unitholders may elect on an individual basis, subject to certain conditions, to (i) convert their Series A Preferred units to common units at the then applicable conversion rate, (ii) if the Partnership is not the surviving entity (or if the Partnership is the surviving entity, but its common units will cease to be listed), require the Partnership to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the surviving entity in any such transaction to issue a substantially equivalent security (or convert into common units based on a specified formula, if the Partnership is unable to cause such substantially equivalent securities to be issued), (iii) if the Partnership is the surviving entity, continue to hold their Series A Preferred units, or (iv) require the Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred units at a price per Series A Preferred unit of   $32.32  , plus accrued and unpaid distributions to be paid in cash or common units at the discretion of the Partnership. 
  The Series A Preferred unitholders will vote on an as-converted basis with the Partnership s common unitholders and will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred unitholders. In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred units, the Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with the Series A Preferred unit purchasers relating to the registered resale of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred units. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Partnership is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file and maintain a registration statement for the resale of the converted Series A Preferred units, with such registration statement to become effective no later than March 2018. 
  The March 2016 Series A units and the April 2016 Series A units were issued at a discount to the then-current market price of the common units into which they are convertible. The discount on the March 2016 Series A units, totaling   $21.7 million  , represents a beneficial conversion feature, and on the date the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement was signed (the  commitment date ), it was reflected as an increase in common unitholders  capital and a decrease in Series A Preferred unitholders  capital to reflect the fair value of the March 2016 Series A units on the commitment date. The discount on the April 2016 Series A units, totaling   $71.7 million  , also represents a beneficial conversion feature and on the date the option to purchase additional Series A units was exercised (the  notice date ), it was reflected as an increase in common unitholders  capital and a decrease in Series A Preferred unitholders  capital to reflect the fair value of the April 2016 Series A units on the notice date. The beneficial conversion features are considered non-cash distributions that will be recognized from each issuance date through the date of earliest conversion, resulting in an increase in Series A Preferred unitholders  capital and a decrease in common unitholders  capital as amortized. The beneficial conversion features are amortized assuming a conversion date of March 14, 2018 for the March 2016 Series A units and a conversion date of April 15, 2018 for the April 2016 Series A units, using the effective yield method.

  Partnership interests.   The Partnership s common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  WES.  
  The following table summarizes the common, Class C, Series A Preferred and general partner units issued during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Holdings of Partnership equity.   As of   September 30, 2016  , WGP held   50,132,046   common units, representing a   30.0%   limited partner interest in the Partnership, and, through its ownership of the general partner, WGP indirectly held   2,583,068   general partner units, representing a   1.5%   general partner interest in the Partnership, and   100%   of the incentive distribution rights. As of   September 30, 2016  , other subsidiaries of Anadarko held   2,011,380   common units and   12,160,424   Class C units, representing an aggregate   8.5%   limited partner interest in the Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , the public held   78,528,544   common units, representing a   46.9%   limited partner interest in the Partnership and private investors held   21,922,831   Series A Preferred units, representing a   13.1%   limited partner interest in the Partnership. 
    
  Net income (loss) per unit for common units.   Net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP earned on and subsequent to the date of the acquisition of the Partnership assets, net of distributions on the Series A Preferred units and amortization of the Series A Preferred unit beneficial conversion features (see   Series A Preferred units   above), is allocated to the general partner, the common unitholders and the Class C unitholder, in accordance with their respective weighted-average ownership percentages (exclusive of the Series A Preferred unit limited partnership interest) and, when applicable, giving effect to incentive distributions allocable to the general partner. The allocable limited partners  interest in net income (loss) is also net of amortization of the beneficial conversion feature related to the Class C units (see   Class C units   above) and is allocated between the common and Class C unitholders by applying the provisions of the partnership agreement that govern actual cash distributions and capital account allocations, as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. Net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership assets acquired from Anadarko for periods prior to the Partnership s acquisition of the Partnership assets is not allocated to the limited partners for purposes of calculating net income (loss) per common unit. 
  Basic net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period. The common units issued in connection with acquisitions and equity offerings are included on a weighted-average basis for periods they were outstanding. The Series A Preferred units are not considered a participating security as they only have distribution rights up to the specified per-unit quarterly distribution and have no rights to the Partnership s undistributed earnings. Because the Class C units participate in distributions with common units according to a predetermined formula (see   Note 3  ), they are considered a participating security and are included in the computation of earnings per unit pursuant to the two-class method. The Class C unit participation right results in a non-contingent transfer of value each time the Partnership declares a distribution. Diluted net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing the sum of (i) the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) attributable to common units adjusted for distributions on the Series A Preferred units and a reallocation of the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) assuming conversion of the Series A Preferred units into common units, and (ii) the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) allocable to the Class C units as a participating security, by the sum of the weighted-average number of common units outstanding plus the dilutive effect of (i) the weighted-average number of outstanding Class C units and (ii) the weighted-average number of common units outstanding assuming conversion of the Series A Preferred units.

5.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 
    
  Affiliate transactions.   Revenues from affiliates include amounts earned by the Partnership from services provided to Anadarko as well as from the sale of residue and NGLs to Anadarko. In addition, the Partnership purchases natural gas from an affiliate of Anadarko pursuant to gas purchase agreements. Operation and maintenance expense includes amounts accrued for or paid to affiliates for the operation of the Partnership assets, whether in providing services to affiliates or to third parties, including field labor, measurement and analysis, and other disbursements. A portion of the Partnership s general and administrative expenses is paid by Anadarko, which results in affiliate transactions pursuant to the reimbursement provisions of the Partnership s omnibus agreement. Affiliate expenses do not bear a direct relationship to affiliate revenues, and third-party expenses do not bear a direct relationship to third-party revenues. See   Note 2   for further information related to contributions of assets to the Partnership by Anadarko. 
    
  Cash management.   Anadarko operates a cash management system whereby excess cash from most of its subsidiaries  separate bank accounts is generally swept to centralized accounts. Prior to the Partnership s acquisition of the Partnership assets, third-party sales and purchases related to such assets were received or paid in cash by Anadarko within its centralized cash management system. The outstanding affiliate balances were entirely settled through an adjustment to net investment by Anadarko in connection with the acquisition of the Partnership assets. Subsequent to the acquisition of Partnership assets from Anadarko, transactions related to such assets are cash-settled directly with third parties and with Anadarko affiliates. Chipeta cash settles its transactions directly with third parties and Anadarko, as well as with the other subsidiaries of the Partnership. 
    
  Note receivable - Anadarko and Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.   Concurrently with the closing of the Partnership s May 2008 initial public offering, the Partnership loaned   $260.0 million   to Anadarko in exchange for a 30-year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of   6.50%  , payable quarterly. The fair value of the note receivable from Anadarko was   $308.1 million   and   $252.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and December 31,   2015  , respectively. The fair value of the note reflects consideration of credit risk and any premium or discount for the differential between the stated interest rate and quarter-end market interest rate, based on quoted market prices of similar debt instruments. Accordingly, the fair value of the note receivable from Anadarko is measured using Level 2 inputs.  
  The consideration to be paid by the Partnership to Anadarko for the March 2015 acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment due on March 31, 2020. See   Note 2     and   Note 9  . 
    
  Commodity price swap agreements.   The Partnership has commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko to mitigate exposure to a majority of the commodity price volatility that would otherwise be present as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas, condensate or NGLs. Notional volumes for each of the commodity price swap agreements are not specifically defined. Instead, the commodity price swap agreements apply to the actual volume of natural gas, condensate and NGLs purchased and sold. The outstanding commodity price swap agreements for the Hugoton system, MGR assets and DJ Basin complex expire in December 2016. The commodity price swap agreements do not satisfy the definition of a derivative financial instrument and, therefore, are not required to be measured at fair value. 
  Below is a summary of the fixed price ranges on all of the Partnership s outstanding commodity price swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016  :

Significant Item Affecting Comparability.   On December 3, 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. The majority of the damage was to the liquid handling facilities and the amine treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of 100 MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains and is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of 200 MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and returned to full service in May 2016. For ease of reference throughout the remainder of this Management s Discussion and Analysis, the damage to the processing facility and resulting lack of processing capacity and associated financial statement impact will be referred to as the  DBM outage.  See   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

    We acquired DBJV from Anadarko. DBJV owns a   50%   interest in the DBJV system. We will make a cash payment on March 31, 2020, to Anadarko as consideration for the acquisition of DBJV. At the acquisition date, we estimated the future payment would be   $282.8 million  , the net present value of which was   $174.3 million  . For further information, including revisions to the estimated future payment, see   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures     in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
               (2)   
    We acquired Springfield from Anadarko for $750.0 million, consisting of $712.5 million in cash and the issuance of 1,253,761 of our common units. Springfield owns a 50.1% interest in the Springfield system. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition through: (i) borrowings of   $247.5 million   on our RCF, (ii) the issuance of   835,841   of our common units to WGP and (iii) the issuance of Series A Preferred units to private investors. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of the Series A Preferred units. 
       
  Assets held for sale - Hugoton system.   During the third quarter of 2016, the Hugoton system, located in Southwest Kansas and Oklahoma, satisfied criteria to be considered held for sale. The assets were remeasured to their current fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement, resulting in a loss of   $6.2 million   at September 30, 2016, recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet included long-term assets of   $65.6 million   and long-term liabilities of   $8.4 million   associated with assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed on October 31, 2016.

Presentation of Partnership assets.     The term  Partnership assets  refers to the assets owned and interests accounted for under the equity method by us as of   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 7 Equity Investments   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Because Anadarko controls us through its ownership and control of WGP, which owns the entire interest in our general partner, each of our acquisitions of Partnership assets from Anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As such, the Partnership assets we acquired from Anadarko were initially recorded at Anadarko s historic carrying value, which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by us. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Further, after an acquisition of Partnership assets from Anadarko, we may be required to recast our financial statements to include the activities of such Partnership assets from the date of common control. 
  The historical financial statements and operational data previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form   10-Q   to include the results attributable to the Springfield interest as if we owned Springfield for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our acquisition of Springfield have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if we had owned Springfield during the periods reported. 

EQUITY OFFERINGS 
    
  Equity offerings.   Pursuant to our $500.0 million COP, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 873,525 common units, at an average price of $66.61, generating proceeds of $57.4 million (net of $0.8 million for the underwriting discount and other offering expenses), which were used for general partnership purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Gross proceeds generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $58.2 million. Commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, were $0.6 million. We issued   no   common units under the $500.0 million COP during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other equity offerings.   In March 2016, we issued the March 2016 Series A units to private investors for a cash purchase price of $32.00 per unit, generating proceeds of $440.0 million (net of fees and expenses, including a 2.0% transaction fee paid to the private investors), which were used to fund a portion of the Springfield acquisition. In April 2016, we issued the April 2016 Series A units pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance, generating net proceeds of   $246.9 million  , which were used to pay down amounts borrowed under our RCF in connection with the Springfield acquisition. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   and   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

  Natural gas assets 
    
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput   decrease  d by   142   MMcf/d for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to decreased throughput at the Bison facility due to volumes being diverted to a third-party treater, the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015, and production declines in the area around the Springfield gas gathering system. These decreases were partially offset by higher throughput at the DBJV system due to increased production in West Texas and increased throughput at the Anadarko-Operated and Non-Operated Marcellus Interest systems due to previously modulated volumes being brought online. 
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput decreased by   306   MMcf/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015 and decreased throughput at the Bison facility due to volumes being diverted to a third-party treater.  
  Processing throughput   increase  d by   121   MMcf/d for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased production in the areas around the DJ Basin complex and the May 2016 start-up of Train IV at the DBM complex. These increases were partially offset by decreased throughput at the Chipeta complex due to decreased drilling activity in the Uinta Basin and production declines in the areas around the MGR assets and Granger complex. Processing throughput   decrease  d by   50   MMcf/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the decreases noted above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as well as to decreases attributable to the DBM outage. 
  Equity investment throughput   increase  d by   7   MMcf/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to volumes being diverted from the third-party Bison pipeline to the Fort Union system, which was partially offset by a decrease in volumes at the Rendezvous system due to production declines in the Jonah and Pinedale Anticline fields. 
    
  Crude/NGL assets 
    
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput   decrease  d by   8   MBbls/d and   13   MBbls/d for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to decreased throughput at the Springfield oil gathering system. Equity investment throughput   increase  d by   12   MBbls/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in volumes on FRP as a result of increased production in the DJ Basin area.

Gathering, Processing and Transportation Revenues 

Revenues from gathering, processing and transportation   increase  d by   $32.2 million   and   $66.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to increases of $26.1 million and $93.9 million, respectively, at the DJ Basin complex resulting from increased throughput and a higher processing fee. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was an increase of $10.0 million at the DBM complex due to increased throughput and a higher processing fee. These increases were partially offset by decreases during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , of (i) $2.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively, due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015 and (ii) $5.6 million and $15.8 million, respectively, at the Springfield system due to decreased throughput.

  Interest expense   decrease  d by   $1.0 million   and   $6.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to   $1.2 million   and   $12.1 million  , respectively, in accretion revisions recorded as reductions to interest expense for the Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko entered into in March 2015 (see   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  ). The accretion revisions were partially offset by interest incurred on the 2026 Notes issued in July 2016 of $5.1 million and interest incurred on the 2025 Notes issued in June 2015 of $8.4 million. Capitalized interest   decrease  d by   $2.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the completion of Lancaster Train II in June 2015 (within the DJ Basin complex), this decrease was partially offset by an increase due to the construction of Trains IV and V and the purchase of long-lead items associated with Train VI at the DBM complex.

Income Tax (Benefit) Expense   

We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, our income apportionable to Texas is subject to Texas margin tax. For the periods presented, our variance from the federal statutory rate, which is zero percent as a non-taxable entity, is primarily due to federal and state taxes on pre-acquisition income attributable to Partnership assets acquired from Anadarko, and our share of Texas margin tax. 
  Income attributable to (i) the Springfield system prior to and including February 2016 and (ii) the DBJV system prior to and including February 2015, was subject to federal and state income tax. Income earned on the Springfield system and the DBJV system for periods subsequent to February 2016 and February 2015, respectively, was only subject to Texas margin tax on income apportionable to Texas.

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS 

(1)   
    Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets is calculated as total revenues and other for natural gas assets, less reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue and cost of product for natural gas assets, plus distributions from our equity investments in Fort Union and Rendezvous, and excluding the noncontrolling interest owner s proportionate share of revenue and cost of product. See the reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets to its most comparable GAAP measure below. 
               (2)   
    Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets is calculated as total revenues and other for crude/NGL assets, less reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue and cost of product for crude/NGL assets, plus distributions from our equity investments in White Cliffs, the Mont Belvieu JV, and the TEFR Interests. See the reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets to its most comparable GAAP measure below. 
               (3)   
    For a reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and Distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the descriptions below. 
               (4)   
    Average for period. Calculated as Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets, divided by total throughput (MMcf/d) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets. 
               (5)   
    Average for period. Calculated as Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets, divided by total throughput (MBbls/d) for crude/NGL assets. 
       
  Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP.   We define Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ( Adjusted gross margin ) as total revenues and other, less cost of product and reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue, plus distributions from equity investees and excluding the noncontrolling interest owner s proportionate share of revenue and cost of product. We believe Adjusted gross margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations, as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry.  
  Adjusted gross margin   increase  d by   $32.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in volumes at the DJ Basin complex and the start-up of Train IV within the DBM complex in May 2016, partially offset by lower volumes at the Springfield system and the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015. Adjusted gross margin   increase  d by   $43.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in volumes at the DJ Basin complex, partially offset by lower volumes due to the DBM outage, lower volumes at the Springfield system, the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015, and lower volumes at the MGR assets and the Chipeta complex.  
  To facilitate investor and industry analyst comparisons between us and our peers, we also disclose   Adjusted gross margin per Mcf attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets   and   Adjusted gross margin per Bbl for crude/NGL assets  . Adjusted gross margin per Mcf attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets   increase  d by   $0.08   and   $0.09   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to increased production in the DJ Basin and the start-up of Lancaster Train II in June 2015 (within the DJ Basin complex). Adjusted gross margin per Bbl for crude/NGL assets   increase  d by   $0.28   and   $0.16   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to higher distributions received from the Mont Belvieu JV and TEP.

Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP.   We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ( Adjusted EBITDA ) as net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, plus distributions from equity investees, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments, and other expense (including lower of cost or market inventory adjustments recorded in cost of product), less gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net, income from equity investments, interest income, income tax benefit, and other income. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following, among other measures: 

our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 

the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions; and 

the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA   increase  d by   $57.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a   $49.1 million     increase   in total revenues and other, a   $14.0 million     decrease   in operation and maintenance expenses,   $13.7 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and a   $1.7 million     increase   in distributions from equity investees. These amounts were partially offset by a   $17.9 million     increase   in cost of product and a   $1.6 million     increase   in property and other tax expense. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   increase  d by   $73.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an   $87.4 million     decrease   in cost of product, a   $16.6 million     decrease   in operation and maintenance expenses,   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and a   $3.2 million     increase   in distributions from equity investees. These amounts were partially offset by a   $42.1 million     decrease   in total revenues and other, a   $5.2 million     increase   in property and other tax expense and a   $2.3 million     increase   in general and administrative expenses excluding non-cash equity-based compensation expense. 
    
  Distributable cash flow.   We define  Distributable cash flow  as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under our commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes. We compare Distributable cash flow to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders. Using this measure, management can quickly compute the Coverage ratio of distributable cash flow to planned cash distributions. We believe Distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies, analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of our swap extensions at the DJ Basin complex and the Hugoton system. 
  While Distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period. Furthermore, to the extent Distributable cash flow includes realized amounts recorded as capital contributions from Anadarko attributable to activity under our commodity price swap agreements, Distributable cash flow is not a reflection of our ability to generate cash from operations.

Distributable cash flow   increase  d by   $47.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to   increase  s of   $57.5 million   in Adjusted EBITDA and   $10.5 million   in the above-market component of the swap extensions with Anadarko. These amounts were partially offset by distributions of   $14.9 million   on Series A Preferred units issued in 2016 and a   $4.8 million     increase   in net cash paid for interest expense. 
  Distributable cash flow   increase  d by   $41.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an   increase   of   $73.6 million   in Adjusted EBITDA and   $26.9 million   in the above-market component of the swap extensions with Anadarko, where such amount related to the above-market component of swaps did not exist prior to the extensions executed on July 1, 2015. These amounts were partially offset by distributions of   $30.9 million   on Series A Preferred units issued in 2016, a   $14.5 million     increase   in cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures and a   $13.2 million     increase   in net cash paid for interest expense. 

Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures.     Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow are not defined in GAAP. The GAAP measure used by us that is most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin is operating income (loss), while net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and net cash provided by operating activities are the GAAP measures used by us that are most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. The GAAP measure used by us that is most directly comparable to Distributable cash flow is net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP. Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the GAAP measures of operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definitions of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry, thereby diminishing their utility. 
  Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow compared to (as applicable) operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our primary cash requirements are for acquisitions and capital expenditures, debt service, customary operating expenses, quarterly distributions to our limited partners and general partner, and distributions to our noncontrolling interest owner. Our sources of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  , included cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, interest income on our   $260.0 million   note receivable from Anadarko, available borrowing capacity under our RCF, and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. We believe that cash flows generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our short-term working capital requirements and long-term maintenance and expansion capital expenditure requirements. The amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, including the extension of commodity price swap agreements, and will be determined by the Board of Directors of our general partner on a quarterly basis. Due to our cash distribution policy, we expect to rely on external financing sources, including equity and debt issuances, to fund expansion capital expenditures and future acquisitions. However, to limit interest expense, we may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions, which could result in subsequent borrowings under our RCF to pay distributions or fund other short-term working capital requirements. 
  We have filed an insurance claim for the incident at the DBM complex and are currently in the adjusting process with insurers. Recoveries from the business interruption claim related to the DBM outage are recognized as income when non-refundable cash proceeds are received from insurers. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had received   $34.7 million   in cash proceeds from insurers related to the incident at the DBM complex, including   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and   $18.4 million   in proceeds from property insurance claims (see   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  ). 
  Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within 45 days of the end of each quarter. We have made cash distributions to our unitholders each quarter since our IPO and have increased our quarterly distribution each quarter since the second quarter of 2009. The Board of Directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution to our unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.845   per unit, or   $166.7 million   in aggregate, including incentive distributions, but excluding distributions on Class C units and Series A Preferred units. The cash distribution is payable on   November 10, 2016  , to unitholders of record at the close of business on   October 31, 2016  . In connection with the closing of the DBM acquisition in November 2014, we issued Class C units that will receive distributions in the form of additional Class C units until the end of 2017, unless earlier converted (see   Note 3 Partnership Distributions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  ). The Class C unit distribution, if paid in cash, would have been   $10.3 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  . In connection with the closing of the Springfield acquisition in March 2016, we issued the March 2016 Series A units, and in April 2016, we issued the April 2016 Series A units pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance. These Series A Preferred units will receive quarterly distributions in cash equal to $0.68 per Series A Preferred unit, subject to certain adjustments. See   Note 3 Partnership Distributions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . For th  e quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Series A Preferred unitholders will receive an aggregate cash distribution of     $14.9 million  , payable in   November 2016  . 
  Management continuously monitors our leverage position and coordinates our capital expenditure program, quarterly distributions and acquisition strategy with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. We will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including additional borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities, to secure funds as needed or to refinance outstanding debt balances with longer term notes. To facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance, we have the ability to sell securities under our shelf registration statements. Our ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Read   Risk Factors   under Part II, Item 1A of this Form   10-Q  .

Working capital  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $113.4 million   of working capital, which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Working capital includes the estimated property insurance receivable related to the DBM outage. See   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Working capital is an indication of our liquidity and potential need for short-term funding. Our working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and factors such as credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, our customers, and the level and timing of our spending for maintenance and expansion activity. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.18 billion   available for borrowing under our RCF. See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 

Capital expenditures  .   Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities or develop new midstream infrastructure. We categorize capital expenditures as either of the following: 

maintenance capital expenditures, which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets, such as to replace system components and equipment that have been subject to significant use over time, become obsolete or reached the end of their useful lives, to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system throughput and related cash flows (for fiscal year 2016, the general partner s Board of Directors has approved Estimated Maintenance Capital Expenditures (as defined in our partnership agreement) of $17.7 million per quarter); or 

expansion capital expenditures, which include expenditures to construct new midstream infrastructure and those expenditures incurred to extend the useful lives of our assets, reduce costs, increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels, including well connections that increase existing system throughput. 
       
  Capital expenditures in the consolidated statements of cash flows reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis, when payments are made. Capital incurred is presented on an accrual basis. Capital expenditures as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows and capital incurred were as follows: 

(1)   
    Maintenance capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are presented net of   $4.9 million   and   zero  , respectively, of contributions in aid of construction costs from affiliates. Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included $32.5 million of pre-acquisition capital expenditures for the Springfield system. 
               (2)   
    Includes the noncontrolling interest owner s share of Chipeta s capital expenditures for all periods presented. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , included   $4.7 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively, of capitalized interest. 
               (3)   
    Capital incurred for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included $29.2 million of pre-acquisition capital incurred for the Springfield system.

Acquisitions during 2016 included Springfield and equipment purchases from Anadarko. Acquisitions during 2015 included equipment purchases from Anadarko and the post-closing purchase price adjustments related to the DBM acquisition. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   and   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates     in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
  Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions,   decrease  d by   $138.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Expansion capital expenditures   decrease  d by   $152.3 million   (including a   $2.2 million     decrease   in capitalized interest) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a decrease of $179.5 million at the DJ Basin complex as a result of decreased activity in 2016. In addition, there were decreases of $34.0 million at the Non-Operated Marcellus Interest systems, $27.4 million at the Springfield system, $16.3 million at the Hilight system, and $9.2 million at the Anadarko-Operated Marcellus Interest systems. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $110.2 million due to continued construction at the DBM complex and an increase of $22.7 million at the DBJV system. Maintenance capital expenditures   increase  d by   $14.2 million  , primarily due to an increase at the DBM complex, partially offset by decreased expenditures at the Non-Operated Marcellus Interest and Springfield systems and the DJ Basin complex. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we updated our estimated total capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2016, (including our 75% share of Chipeta s capital expenditures and equity investments, but excluding acquisitions) from an originally reported $450 million to $490 million, to a range of $490 million to $530 million.

See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
    
  Senior Notes  . At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing our outstanding notes. 
  The 2026 Notes issued in July 2016 were offered at a price to the public of   99.796%   of the face amount. Including the effects of the issuance and underwriting discounts, the effective interest rate of the 2026 Notes is   4.787%  . Interest is paid semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $3.1 million  , original issue discount and debt issuance costs) were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the RCF.  
  In October 2016, we issued an additional   $200.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2044 Notes at a price to the public of   102.776%   of the face amount plus accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date. These notes were offered as additional notes under the indenture governing the 2044 Notes issued in March 2014 and are treated as a single class of securities with the 2044 Notes under such indenture. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $1.8 million   and debt issuance costs and excluding accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date) were used to repay amounts then outstanding under the RCF. The remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. 
    
  Revolving credit facility.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $20.0 million   of outstanding borrowings,   $4.9 million   in outstanding letters of credit and   $1.18 billion   available for borrowing under the RCF, which matures in February 2019. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the RCF was   1.82%  , the facility fee rate was   0.20%   and we were in compliance with all covenants under the RCF. 
  In April 2016, we repaid $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our RCF, $246.9 million of which was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of the April 2016 Series A units. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Additionally, in July 2016, we repaid $540.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our RCF, primarily with the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes. In October 2016, we repaid $20.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our RCF, with the proceeds from the offering of the new notes issued in October 2016. 
    
  Interest rate agreements.   In June 2016, we entered into a U.S. Treasury rate lock agreement to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on existing variable-rate debt expected to be refinanced during the third quarter of 2016. The rate lock agreement was not designated as a cash flow hedge and was settled in June 2016 upon the offering of the 2026 Notes that closed in July 2016. We realized a loss of   $0.2 million   at settlement, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.     The consideration to be paid for the acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment to Anadarko due on March 31, 2020. The cash payment will be equal to (a) eight multiplied by the average of our share in the Net Earnings (see definition below) of DBJV for the calendar years 2018 and 2019, less (b) our share of all capital expenditures incurred for DBJV between March 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. Net Earnings is defined as all revenues less cost of product, operating expenses and property taxes, in each case attributable to DBJV on an accrual basis. As of the acquisition date, the estimated future payment obligation (based on management s estimate of our share of forecasted Net Earnings and capital expenditures for DBJV) was   $282.8 million  , which had a net present value of   $174.3 million  , using a discount rate of   10%  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized an aggregate   $259.9 million   decrease in the estimated future payment obligation, resulting in a net present value of   $16.4 million   for this obligation at September 30, 2016, calculated using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% discount rate. The reduction in the value of the deferred purchase price obligation is primarily due to revisions reflecting a decrease in our estimate of 2018 and 2019 Net Earnings and an increase in our estimate of aggregate capital expenditures to be incurred by DBJV through February 29, 2020. The accretion revision, which was recorded as a reduction to Interest expense, was   $1.2 million   and   $12.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Accretion expense was $4.3 million and $9.9 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
    
  Securities  .   We may issue an indeterminate amount of common units and various debt securities under our effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC. We may issue common units under the $500.0 million COP, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the capacity to issue additional common units with an aggregate sales price of up to $441.8 million under the $500.0 million COP. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of trades completed under the $500.0 million COP. 
  In March 2016, in connection with the issuance of the March 2016 Series A units, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Series A Preferred unit purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to file and maintain a registration statement with respect to the resale of common units that are issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred units. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of the Series A Preferred units. 

Credit risk  .   We bear credit risk represented by our exposure to non-payment or non-performance by our counterparties, including Anadarko, financial institutions, customers and other parties. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customer s inability to satisfy payables to us for services rendered or volumes owed pursuant to gas imbalance agreements. We examine and monitor the creditworthiness of third-party customers and may establish credit limits for third-party customers. 
  We are dependent upon a single producer, Anadarko, for a majority of our volumes (excluding our equity investment throughput), and we do not maintain a credit limit with respect to Anadarko. Consequently, we are subject to the risk of non-payment or late payment by Anadarko for gathering, processing and transportation fees and for proceeds from the sale of residue, NGLs and condensate to Anadarko. 
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

We expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue for as long as we remain substantially dependent on Anadarko for our revenues. Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk on the note receivable from Anadarko. We are also party to agreements with Anadarko under which Anadarko is required to indemnify us for certain environmental claims, losses arising from rights-of-way claims, failures to obtain required consents or governmental permits and income taxes with respect to the assets acquired from Anadarko. Finally, we have entered into various commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko in order to reduce our exposure to a majority of the commodity price risk inherent in our percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, and are subject to performance risk thereunder. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
  Our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be adversely impacted if Anadarko becomes unable to perform under the terms of our gathering, processing and transportation agreements, natural gas and NGL purchase agreements, Anadarko s note payable to us, our omnibus agreement, the services and secondment agreement, contribution agreements or the commodity price swap agreements. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  Our contractual obligations include, among other things, a revolving credit facility, other third-party long-term debt, capital obligations related to our expansion projects and various operating leases. Refer to     Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   and   Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for an update to our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  , including, but not limited to, increases in committed capital. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and standby letters of credit. The information pertaining to operating leases and our standby letters of credit required for this item is provided under   Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies   and   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense  , respectively, included in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Commodity price risk.   Certain of our processing services are provided under percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole agreements in which Anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas, condensate and NGLs. Under percent-of-proceeds agreements, we receive a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of residue and/or NGLs. Under keep-whole agreements, we keep 100% of the NGLs produced, and the processed natural gas, or value of the natural gas, is returned to the producer. Since some of the gas is used and removed during processing, we compensate the producer for the amount of gas used and removed in processing by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed-upon value for the gas used. 
  To mitigate our exposure to a majority of the changes in commodity prices as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas, condensate or NGLs, we currently have in place commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko expiring in December 2016. On June 25, 2015, we extended our commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko for the DJ Basin complex from July 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, and for the Hugoton system from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. On December 8, 2015, the DJ Basin complex and Hugoton system swaps were further extended from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
  We consider our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above-described arrangements to be minimal given the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko and the relatively small amount of our operating income (loss) that is impacted by changes in market prices. Accordingly, we do not expect a 10% increase or decrease in natural gas or NGL prices would have a material impact on our operating income (loss), financial condition or cash flows for the next twelve months, excluding the effect of natural gas imbalances described below. 
  We bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to settlement of our natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into our systems and gas volumes delivered by us to customers, as well as instances where our actual liquids recovery or fuel usage varies from the contractually stipulated amounts. Natural gas volumes owed to or by us that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates, and generally reflect market index prices. Other natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at our weighted-average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in-kind. Our exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances. 
    
  Interest rate risk.   Interest rates during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were low compared to historic rates. In December 2015, while raising the target range for the federal funds rate from zero to between 1/4 to 1/2 percent, the Federal Open Market Committee signaled that further increases are likely over the medium term. Any such increases in the federal funds rate will ultimately result in an increase in our financing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $20.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under our RCF (which bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, at our option, an alternative base rate). If interest rates rise, our future financing costs could increase. A 10% change in LIBOR would have resulted in a nominal change in net income (loss) and the fair value of the borrowings under the RCF at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future, either under our RCF or other financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .   The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Partnership s general partner (for purposes of this Item 4,  Management ) performed an evaluation of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, Management has concluded that the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Remediation Plan.   As disclosed in Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Part II, Item 8 of the Partnership s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016, as of December 31, 2015, Management determined that a material weakness (as defined in the regulations of the SEC) existed in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership, subject to senior management review, began remediating this material weakness by, among other things, implementing a training program for the personnel involved in the impairment determination processes and controls to ensure business understanding and the proper application of GAAP and the Partnership s accounting policies related to the impairment of long-lived assets. During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership completed these remediation activities by testing the operating effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts and found them to be effective. As a result, Management has concluded that the material weakness had been remediated as of June 30, 2016. As the Partnership continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, Management may execute additional measures to address the material weakness or modify the remediation plan described above and will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of the Partnership s internal controls. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  .   There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  WGR Operating, LP, one of our subsidiaries, is currently in negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with respect to alleged non-compliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of the federal Clean Air Act at its Granger, Wyoming facility. Although management cannot predict the outcome of settlement discussions, management believes that it is reasonably likely a resolution of this matter will result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000. 
  Except as discussed above, we are not a party to any legal, regulatory or administrative proceedings other than proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that there are no such proceedings for which a final disposition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or for which disclosure is otherwise required by Item 103 of Regulation S-K. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors included below, as well as those set forth under Part I, Item 1A in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , together with all of the other information included in this document, and in our other public filings, press releases and public discussions with management of the Partnership. Additionally, for a full discussion of the risks associated with Anadarko s business, see Item 1A under Part I in Anadarko s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Anadarko s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Anadarko s other public filings, press releases and public discussions with Anadarko management. We have identified these risk factors as important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. 
    
  New pipeline safety legislation could result in more stringent requirements on our gas pipelines and gathering lines, which could trigger significant capital costs and costs of operation. 
    
  On June 22, 2016, President Obama signed new pipeline safety legislation, the  Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016  (the  PIPES Act ), just recently passed by Congress. Extending the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration s ( PHMSA ) statutory mandate through 2019, the PIPES Act establishes or continues the development of requirements affecting pipeline safety including, but not limited to, the following: (i) providing PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing; (ii) obligating PHMSA to develop safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018; and (iii) requiring PHMSA to complete certain of the outstanding mandates under existing legislation and to report to Congress on the status of overdue rulemakings. The development and/or implementation of more stringent requirements pursuant to the PIPES Act could cause us to incur increased capital costs and costs of operation as necessary to comply with such standards, which costs could be significant.

The holders of our Series A Preferred units have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of our common units, and could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the holders of our common units. 
    
  The holders of our Series A Preferred units, first issued in March 2016, are entitled to certain rights that are senior to the rights of holders of common and Class C units, such as rights to distributions and rights upon liquidation of the Partnership. No payment or distribution on any junior equity security of the Partnership, including common and Class C units, for any quarter is permitted prior to the payment in full of the Series A Preferred unit distribution (including any outstanding arrearages). These preferences could adversely affect the market price for our common units, or could make it more difficult for us to issue and sell common units in the future. 
  In addition, distributions on the Series A Preferred units accrue and are cumulative, at a quarterly rate of $0.68 per unit, and the Series A Preferred units are convertible into common units by the holders or by us in certain circumstances. Our obligation to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred units, or on the common units issued following the conversion of the Series A Preferred units, could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general partnership purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred units could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
  In addition, the holders of our Series A Preferred units may convert the Series A Preferred units into common units on a one-for-one basis at any time after the second anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. Similarly, the Partnership may convert the Series A Preferred units at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. If a substantial portion of the Series A Preferred units are converted into common units, common unitholders could experience significant dilution. Further, if holders of converted Series A Preferred units dispose of a substantial portion of such common units in the public market, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions, it could adversely affect the market price for our common units. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future. 
    
  Proposed rule changes regarding gas pipeline safety could impose more stringent standards on our gas pipelines and gathering lines that, if adopted, may result in increased significant capital costs and costs of operation. 
    
  On March 17, 2016, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) announced a proposed rulemaking that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines under varying circumstances. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond  high consequence areas  to newly defined  moderate consequence areas  that contain as few as 5 dwellings within the potential impact area; require gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus  grandfathered,  or excluded, from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures ( MAOP  and require gathering lines in Class I areas, both onshore and offshore, to comply with standards regarding damage prevention, corrosion control (for metallic pipe), public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning if such gathering lines  nominal design is 8 inches or more. In order to provide clarity and greater certainty on what may constitute a  gathering line,  PHMSA is proposing a new definition of that term under the rulemaking, which term would now encompass  a pipeline, or a connected series of pipelines, and equipment used to collect gas from the endpoint of a production facility/operation and transport it to the furthermost point downstream of the following endpoints  including the  inlet of 1st gas processing plant;  the  outlet of  a gas treatment facility (not associated with a processing plant or compressor station); the  [o]utlet of the furthermost downstream compressor  leading to a pipeline; or the  point where separate production fields are commingled.  Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. Adoption of some or all of these standards under the proposed rulemaking could cause us to incur increased capital costs and costs of operation, which costs could be significant.

Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. 
    
  Our general partner may transfer all, but not less than all, of its general partner interest to a third party in connection with a merger or consolidation or the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. On or after June 30, 2018, such transfer may be effected in whole or in part without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of (i) WGP to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party, or (ii) Anadarko to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in WGP and/or WGP s general partner to a third party. Additionally, in March 2016, WGP entered into a secured credit facility under which it has pledged, among other things, its entire interest in our general partner. If WGP were to default, the lenders party to this facility could foreclose upon the interest and take control of our general partner. Any new owner of our general partner or WGP s general partner, as the case may be, would then be in a position to replace the Board of Directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the Board of Directors and officers. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , in connection with the quarterly distribution for the Class C units, we issued the following PIK Class C units to APC Midstream Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Anadarko and the holder of the Class C units: 

No proceeds were received as consideration for the issuance of the PIK Class C units. The PIK Class C units were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. All outstanding Class C units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis on December 31, 2017, unless the Partnership elects to convert such units earlier or Anadarko extends the conversion date. For more information, see   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
