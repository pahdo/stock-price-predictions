  This   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act.  Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   potential,   intend,   expect,   seek,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   could,   project,   predict,   continue,   future  or other similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe plans and strategies, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information.  Such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to the operating performance of our investments, our liquidity and financing needs, the effects of our current strategies and investment activities, our ability to grow our business, our expected leverage, our expected cost of capital, our ability to divest non-strategic properties, our management s track record and our ability to raise and effectively deploy capital.  Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of plans or strategies is inherently uncertain, particularly given the economic environment.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and you should not unduly rely on these statements.  These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.

    the historical combined consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q   not providing an accurate indication of our performance in the future or reflecting what our financial position, results of operations or cash flow would have been had we operated as an independent public company during the periods presented;

           1. 
    Formation and Organization 
     NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. ( NorthStar Europe  or the  Company ), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust ( REIT ), is a European focused commercial real estate company with predominantly prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  The Company s objective is to provide its stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time.  The Company commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. ( NorthStar Realty ) of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Europe, a Maryland corporation (the  Spin-off ). 
  Upon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty contributed: (i) its business activities related to a multi-tenant office complex located in the United Kingdom (the  U.K. Complex ) acquired on September 16, 2014; (ii) other European real estate portfolios acquired in the second and third quarters of 2015 and primarily comprised of multi-tenant office properties (the  New European Investments  and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty s European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business.  
  On November 2, 2015, the Company s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ).  The Company is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), which together with its affiliates is referred to as NSAM.  Substantially all of the Company s assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and the Company conducts its operations, directly or indirectly, through NorthStar Realty Europe Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of the Company (the  Operating Partnership ).  The Company has elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct its operations so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
  All references herein to the Company refer to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires. 
  Sales Initiatives 
  The Company continues to concentrate on primarily office properties in Germany, the United Kingdom and France (the  Core Markets ).  As a result, the Company has executed a series of sales initiatives of assets outside the Core Markets with the goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value.  
  Merger Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, the Company s external manager, NSAM, announced that it entered into a merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. ( Colony ) under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform (the  Mergers ).  The transaction has been approved by NSAM and NorthStar Realty s respective board of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective special committees and the board of directors of Colony. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of NorthStar Realty s, Colony s and NSAM s respective stockholder approvals. 
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited combined consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the combined consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.  The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.  These combined consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  The   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   are presented on a carve-out basis and have been prepared from the historical consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of NorthStar Realty. 
  The contribution of the European Real Estate Business to the Company has been determined to be a combination of entities under common control that results in a change in the reporting entity which requires retrospective application to the Company s financial

statements under U.S. GAAP.  Accordingly, the operations of the European Real Estate Business of NorthStar Realty transferred to the Company upon the Spin-off are presented as if the transferred business was the business of the Company for periods in which common control was present and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities recorded in NorthStar Realty s historical books and records. 
  Historically, financial statements of the Company have not been prepared as it had not operated separately from NorthStar Realty.  These combined consolidated financial statements reflect the revenues and direct expenses of the Company and include material assets and liabilities of NorthStar Realty that are specifically identifiable to the European Real Estate Business and contributed to the Company upon completion of the Spin-off.  The combined consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , represent the Company prior to the Spin-off and include certain consolidated subsidiaries.  Subsequent to the Spin-off, the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis. 
  The combined consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   include an allocation of costs and expenses by NorthStar Realty related to the Company (primarily compensation and other general and administrative expenses of   $0.9 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively) based on an estimate of expenses as if the Company was managed as an independent entity.  This allocation method is principally based on relative headcount and management s knowledge of the operations of the Company.  The amounts allocated in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts of such indirect expenses that would have been recorded had the Company been a separate independent entity.  The Company believes the assumptions underlying its allocation of indirect expenses are reasonable.  In addition, an estimate of management fees to NSAM of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, is recorded as if the Company was managed as an independent entity and is included in general and administrative expense in the combined consolidated statements of operations.  The Company began paying management fees to NSAM on November 1, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the Company s management agreement with NSAM (refer to Note 5). 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The combined consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities ( VIE ) where the Company is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by the Company.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  The Company bases its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.  The Company reassesses its initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Company and the other interests.  The Company reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 
  The Company will evaluate its investments in unconsolidated ventures to determine whether they are a VIE.  The Company analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.

Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If the Company has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  The Company does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote. 
  The Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Non-controlling Interests 
  A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.  A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the combined consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to non-controlling interests.  An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  Estimates 
  The preparation of combined consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the combined consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.   
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the combined consolidated financial statements to conform to current period presentation.   
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The Company reports combined consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in separate statements following the combined consolidated statements of operations.  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI.  The components of OCI principally include the foreign currency translation adjustment, net.   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
  The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less and deposits held with third parties that are readily convertible to cash to be cash equivalents.  Cash, including amounts restricted at certain banks and financial institutions, may at times exceed insurable amounts.  The Company seeks to mitigate credit risk by placing cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions.  To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents exclude escrow arrangements entered into for specific warranties in relation to the real estate sales.  
  Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts related to operating real estate such as escrows for taxes, insurance, capital expenditures, tenant security deposits and payments required under certain lease agreements and amounts related to the Company s borrowings. 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.   
  The Company accounts for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases and goodwill.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in the combined consolidated statements of operations.

Assets and Liabilities Held For Sale     
  Operating real estate which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale is separately presented on the combined consolidated balance sheets.  Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell net of the intangible assets associated with the asset.  Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded.  The Company records a gain or loss on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and the Company has no substantial economic involvement with the property.  If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, the Company defers some or all of the gain or loss recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.   
  Deferred Costs 
  Deferred costs primarily include deferred financing costs and deferred lease costs.  Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing.  Costs related to revolving credit facilities are recorded in other assets and are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line basis over the term of the facility.  Costs related to other borrowings are recorded net against the carrying value of such borrowings and are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method or straight-line method depending on the type of financing.  Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated borrowing is repaid before maturity.  Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions, which do not close, are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not occur.  Deferred lease costs consist of fees incurred to initiate and renew operating leases, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and are recorded to depreciation and amortization in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Intangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities  
  The Company records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value.  The value allocated to the above or below-market leases is amortized net adjustment to rental income, the value of below-market ground leases is amortized into properties - operating expense and in-place leases is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, in the combined consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the respective remaining lease term. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  The Company analyzes goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary.  The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets.  The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the combined consolidated statements of operations.

  The following tables present a summary of other assets and other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Revenue Recognition 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Rental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals, subject to indexation, and expense reimbursements to be paid in quarterly or monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.  The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable on the combined consolidated balance sheets.  The Company amortizes any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Escalation income represents revenue from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate

taxes paid by the Company on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
  In a situation in which a lease or leases associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above and below market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and leasing commissions).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, the Company may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within depreciation and amortization in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Impairment on Investments 
  Operating Real Estate 
  The Company s real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of its operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if the Company s estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  In conducting this review, the Company considers global macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of a tenant to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, the Company establishes, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts. 
  Equity-Based Compensation 
  The Company accounts for equity-based compensation awards using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of fair value of the award.  Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof.  For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis or the attribution method depending if the grant is to an employee or non-employee.  For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method.  For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate.  The Company recognizes compensation expense, over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.  For awards with a combination of performance or market measures, the Company estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards.  First, the Company estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure.  If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, the Company records the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above.  This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met.  If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, the Company records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure.  The Company would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense. 
  Equity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date.  Time-based awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any. 
  Derivatives 
  The Company seeks to use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.  The change in fair value for a derivative is recorded in earnings. 
  The Company s derivative instruments are recorded on the combined consolidated balance sheets at fair value and do not qualify as hedges under U.S. GAAP.  Therefore, the change in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in earnings. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a functional foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency

exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment ( CTA ), net, is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the combined consolidated statements of equity.  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $11.5 million   and   $11.9 million  , respectively, of CTA to realized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations due to the sale of certain real estate assets (refer to Note 3). 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  The Company s basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding.  Diluted EPS includes restricted stock and the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or other contracts to issue common stock, assuming performance hurdles have been met, were converted to common stock (including limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership owned by holders other than the Company ( Common Units ) and Common Units which are structured as profits interests ( LTIP Units  collectively referred to as Unit Holders) (refer to Note 7), where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS.  The dilutive effect of such RSUs and Unit Holders is calculated assuming all units are converted to common stock. 
  Income Taxes  
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the initial filing of its 2015 U.S. federal tax return and will continue to comply with the related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the ( Internal Revenue Code ).  Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset, income and share ownership tests are met.  To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain other requirements.  Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on its undistributed taxable income.  The Company distributes to its stockholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  The Company conducts its business through foreign subsidiaries which may be subject to local level income tax in the European jurisdictions it operates.  The Company has also elected taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) status for one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries.  This enables the Company to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and participate in activities that do not qualify as  rents from real property.   The TRS is not resident in the U.S. and, as such, not subject to U.S. taxation but is subject to foreign income taxes only.  In addition, the REIT will not generally be subject to any additional U.S. taxes on the repatriation of its earnings. 
  For the Company s foreign subsidiaries, including the Company s foreign TRS, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the foreign tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.  The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets (e.g. net operating loss) and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.  When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers estimates of expected future taxable income, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook.  This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods.  Due to past and projected losses in certain local jurisdictions where the Company does not have carryback potential and/or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income, the Company recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against the Company s deferred tax assets.  The Company will continue to review its deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  The Company recorded an income tax expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $2.7 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively.  The Company recorded an income tax benefit for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   of   $3.8 million   and   $15.2 million  , respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for the Company will be January 1, 2018.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined the Company s Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  In addition, the Company identified each of its properties that have non-controlling interests as VIEs.  These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights and the Company is the primary beneficiary.  As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence.  Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related.  Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination, for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated statements of cash flows.

Base Management Fee 
  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $3.5 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively, related to the base management fee.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.5 million   is recorded in due to related party on the consolidated balance sheets.  The base management fee to NSAM could increase subsequent to   September 30, 2016   by an amount equal to   1.5%   per annum of the sum of: 
             
    any equity the Company issues in exchange or conversion of exchangeable or stock-settlable notes; 
                
    any other issuances by the Company of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership (excluding units issued to the Company and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and 
                
    cumulative cash available for distribution ( CAD ), if any, of the Company in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP Units or other equity awards which began with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
     Incentive Fee 
  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company did not incur an incentive fee.  The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to: 
             
    the product of: (a)   15.0%   and (b) the Company s CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of   $0.30   per share and up to   $0.36   per share; plus   
                
    the product of: (a)   25.0%   and (b) the Company s CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of   $0.36   per share;  
                
    multiplied by the Company s weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter. 
     Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of the Company s common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis.  With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance.  With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction. 
  Additional Management Agreement Terms 
  If the Company were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by NSAM on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between the Company and NSAM.  The management agreement further provides that the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than the aggregate base management fee in place at the Company immediately prior to such spin-off. 
  The Company s management agreement with NSAM provides that in the event of a change of control of NSAM or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, the Company will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay the Company s consent.  The management agreement further provides that the Company anticipates consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $  10 billion   of assets under management.  The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction by the Company or NSAM, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement. 
  Payment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation 
  The Company is responsible for all of its direct costs and expenses and reimburses NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on the Company s behalf.  In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to the Company related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the Company s management agreement with NSAM (the  G A Allocation ).  The Company s management agreement with NSAM provides that the amount of the G A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i)   20%   of the combined total of: (a) the Company s and NorthStar Realty s (the  NorthStar Listed Companies ) general and administrative expenses as reported in their combined consolidated financial statements excluding: (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to NSAM under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar

Listed Companies ( NorthStar Listed Companies  G A  and (b) NSAM s general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of NSAM; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies  G A.  The G A Allocation may include the Company s allocable share of NSAM s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing the Company s affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to the Company s affairs.  The G A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies  affairs.  In addition, the Company will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between NSAM and any of its executives, employees or other service providers. 
  In connection with the Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies  obligation to reimburse NSAM for the G A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at NSAM s discretion, and the   20%   cap on the G A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies.  NSAM currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management.

  In addition, the Company, together with NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Realty, will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for up to   50%   of any long-term bonus or other compensation that NSAM s compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of NSAM during any year.  Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between NSAM and NorthStar Realty or any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Realty, the amount paid by the Company, NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Realty will be determined by NSAM in its discretion.  At the discretion of NSAM s compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of the Company s restricted stock, restricted stock units, long-term incentive plan units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of the Company s common stock are not available for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash.      The Company s equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of the NSAM compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual s equity compensation may be greater or less than   50%  . 
  NSAM purchase of common stock 
  In June 2016, NSAM purchased   0.2 million   shares of the Company s common stock through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.3 million  . 
   
           6. 
    Compensation Expense 
     The following summarizes the equity-based compensation plans of the Company and NorthStar Realty, as they relate to compensation payable by the Company or its Operating Partnership: 
  NorthStar Realty Europe Equity Plan 
  In October 2015, the board of directors of the Company adopted the NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. 2015 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), which was subsequently approved by the Company s sole stockholder at the time.  The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based incentive awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of common stock of NorthStar Europe, in the form of restricted shares and other equity-based awards such as LTIP Units or any combination of the foregoing.  Following the completion of the Spin-off, the 2015 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company.  The eligible participants in the 2015 Plan include directors, officers, employees, co-employees, consultants and advisors of the Company, NSAM or of any parent or subsidiary who provides services to the Company.    10 million   shares of common stock are reserved and available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, plus on January 1, 2017 and each January 1 thereafter, an additional   2%   of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 will become available for issuance.  In addition, shares of common stock underlying any awards that are forfeited, canceled, held back upon exercise of a stock option or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock or otherwise

terminated (other than by exercise) will be added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan.    No   equity awards under the 2015 Plan were issued prior to the Spin-off. 
  In March 2016, as contemplated in connection with the Spin-off, the Company granted an aggregate of   995,698   restricted shares of common stock and   1,493,551   RSUs to executive officers and employees of NSAM or one of its subsidiaries.  The restricted shares of common stock vest over the approximately   four  -year period ending December 31, 2019, subject to continued employment with NSAM or one of its subsidiaries and the RSUs are subject to the achievement of performance-based vesting conditions and continued employment with NSAM or one of its subsidiaries.  Approximately one-half of these RSUs are market-based awards and are subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles relating to the Company s absolute total stockholder return and continued employment with NSAM or one of its subsidiaries over the approximately   four  -year period from the grant date through December 31, 2019 ( Absolute RSUs ).  The other approximately one-half of these RSUs are market-based awards and are subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles based on the Company s total stockholder return relative to the MSCI US REIT Index and continued employment with NSAM or one of its subsidiaries over the approximately four-year period from the grant date through December 31, 2019 ( Relative RSUs ).  Award recipients may earn up to   100%   of the Absolute RSUs that were granted and up to   125%   of the Relative RSUs that were granted.  Upon vesting pursuant to the terms of the Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs, the RSUs that vest will be settled in shares of common stock and the recipients will be entitled to receive the distributions that would have been paid with respect to a share of common stock (for each share that vests) on or after the date the RSUs were initially granted. 
  NSAM Bonus Plan 
  Pursuant to the Company s management agreement with NSAM, the Company and NorthStar Realty are responsible for paying up to   50%   of the long-term bonuses earned under the NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.  Executive Incentive Bonus Plan ( NSAM Bonus Plan ).  Long-term bonuses are generally paid to executives in the form of equity-based awards of the Company, NorthStar Realty and NSAM, subject to performance-based and time-based vesting conditions over a   four  -year performance period.   
  In connection with the NSAM Bonus Plan, for 2015, a portion of the long-term bonus was paid in restricted shares of common stock and a portion of the long-term bonus was paid by the Company by issuing RSUs.  In connection with the 2015 long-term bonuses paid by the Company, in February 2016, the Company granted   335,336   restricted shares of common stock to NSAM s executive officers, of which   25%   were vested upon grant and the remainder is subject to vesting in equal installments on December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, subject to the recipient s continued employment with NorthStar Realty or NSAM through the applicable vesting dates.  In connection with the issuance of these shares, in February 2016, the Company retired   44,214   of the vested shares of common stock to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding requirements.  In addition, in February 2016, the Company granted   194,422   RSUs to NSAM s executive officers, which are subject to vesting based on the total stockholder return of NorthStar Realty for the period prior to the Spin-off and the combined total stockholder return of NorthStar Realty and the Company for the period after the Spin-off, CAD of the Company and continued employment with NorthStar Realty or NSAM over the   four  -year period ending December 31, 2018.  Following the determination of the number of these performance-based RSUs that vest, the Company will settle the vested RSUs by issuing an equal number of shares of common stock and the NSAM executives will be entitled to receive the distributions that would have been paid with respect to a share of common stock (for each RSU that vests) on or after January 1, 2015.  In February 2016, the Company also granted   281,040   restricted shares of common stock (net of forfeitures occurring through September 30, 2016) to certain of NSAM s non-executive employees, including executive officers of the Company, with substantially similar terms to the executive awards subject to time-based vesting conditions. 
  NorthStar Realty Equity Plans 
  NorthStar Realty issued equity-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors pursuant to the NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the  NorthStar Realty Stock Plan ) and the NorthStar Realty Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, as amended (the  NorthStar Realty Plan  and collectively the  NorthStar Realty Equity Plans ). 
  All of the vested and unvested equity-based awards granted by NorthStar Realty prior to the Spin-off remain outstanding following the Spin-off.  In connection with the Spin-off, holders of shares of common stock of NorthStar Realty and LTIP units of NorthStar Realty s operating partnership subject to outstanding equity awards received one share of the Company s common stock or one Common Unit in the Company s operating partnership, respectively, for every   six   shares of common stock of NorthStar Realty or LTIP units of NorthStar Realty s operating partnership held (prior to NorthStar Realty s one-for-  two   reverse stock split effected immediately following the Spin-off), all of which generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the Spin-off.  Other equity and equity-based awards relating to NorthStar Realty s common stock, such as RSUs, were adjusted to also relate to one-third of a share of the Company s common stock (after giving effect to NorthStar Realty s one-for-  two   reverse

stock split effected immediately following the Spin-off), but otherwise generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the Spin-off.  Performance-based vesting conditions based on total stockholder return of NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Realty and NSAM were adjusted to refer to combined total stockholder return of NorthStar Realty and the Company or NorthStar Realty, NSAM and the Company, respectively, with respect to periods after the Spin-off and references to a change of control or similar term in outstanding awards, which referred to a change of control of either NorthStar Realty or NSAM, were adjusted, to the extent such awards relate to common stock of the Company or Common Units in the Company s Operating Partnership, to refer to a change of control of either the Company or NSAM. 
  Following the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty and the compensation committee of its board of directors continues to administer all awards issued under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans but the Company is obligated to issue shares of the Company s common stock or other equity awards of its subsidiaries or make cash payments in lieu thereof or with respect to dividend or distribution equivalent obligations to the extent required by these awards under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans.  These awards continue to be governed by the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans, as applicable, and shares of the Company s common stock issued pursuant to these awards will not be issued pursuant to, or reduce availability under the 2015 Plan. 
  In connection with the Spin-off, the Company issued the following related to the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016:   16,532   of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, which remain subject to vesting;   618,120   Common Units, net of forfeitures and conversions, of which   217,823   remain subject to vesting;   83,333   RSUs, which remain subject to vesting and   375,293   RSUs related to executives of NSAM only, which remain subject to vesting based on performance conditions and continued NSAM employment.  On December 31, 2015, the performance hurdle for   117,472   RSUs was met pursuant to NorthStar Realty s bonus plan for 2012 and the Company settled these RSUs on January 4, 2016.  Additionally, in connection with the initial election of the independent members of the Company s board of directors, the Company issued   17,528   restricted shares of common stock and   70,112   LTIP Units to such directors. 
  The following table presents activity related to the issuance, vesting and forfeitures of restricted stock and Common Units.  The balance as of   September 30, 2016   represents Common Units whether vested or not that are outstanding and unvested shares of restricted stock (grants in thousands):

Earnings Per Share

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The EPS calculation takes into account Unit Holders, which receive non-forfeitable dividends from the date of grant, share equally in the Company s net income (loss) and convert on a   one  -for-one basis into common stock. 
              (2) 
    Excludes the effect of restricted stock and RSUs outstanding that were not dilutive as of   September 30, 2016  .  These instruments could potentially impact diluted EPS in future periods, depending on changes in the Company s stock price and other factors. 
              (3) 
    Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was calculated using the common stock issued in connection with the Spin-off and exclude the effect of any equity-based awards outstanding at that date that were not dilutive.

    Non-controlling Interests 
     Operating Partnership 
  Non-controlling interests include the aggregate Units Holders  interest in the Operating Partnership.  Net income (loss) attributable to this non-controlling interest is based on the weighted average Unit Holders  ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership for the respective period.  As the Operating Partnership was formed in conjunction with the Spin-off, non-controlling interest related to Unit Holders was recognized for the year ended   December 31, 2015   to retrospectively adjust for common control of the business (refer to Note 2).  The issuance of additional common stock, Common Units or LTIP Units changes the percentage

ownership of both the Unit Holders and the Company.  Since a Common Unit or LTIP Unit is generally redeemable for cash or common stock at the option of the Company, it is deemed to be equivalent to common stock.  Therefore, such transactions are treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders  equity and non-controlling interests on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets to account for the change in the ownership of the underlying equity in the Operating Partnership.  On a quarterly basis, the carrying value of such non-controlling interest is allocated based on the number of Unit Holders in total in proportion to the number of Units Holders plus the number of shares of common stock outstanding.  In connection with the formation of the Operating Partnership in November 2015, the Company recorded a non-controlling interest of   $8.7 million   related to Unit Holders.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   688,232   Common Units and LTIP Units were outstanding, representing a   1.1%   ownership and non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership.  Net income (loss) attributable to the Operating Partnership non-controlling interest for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was a net loss of   $0.2 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. 
  Redeemable Non-controlling Interest 
  In connection with the acquisition of the Trianon Tower, the Company sold a   5.5%   non-controlling interest in certain subsidiaries that own the Trianon Tower for   $1.5 million  .  In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into a put option whereby the holder can redeem its interest for cash at the greater of fair market value of such non-controlling interest or    2.1 million   beginning in November 2020 through January 2021.  The Company recorded the non-controlling interest at its acquisition date fair value as temporary equity, due to the redemption option and accretes the redeemable non-controlling interest to its redemption value.  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company recorded an immaterial amount in net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests to adjust the carrying value to its redemption value as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
           9. 
    Fair Value 
     Fair Value Measurement  
  The fair value of financial instruments is categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique and categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the combined consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:  
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              (a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              (b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              (c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              (d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
  Derivative Instruments 
  Derivative instruments are valued using a third-party pricing service.  These quotations are not adjusted and are generally based on valuation models with observable inputs such as interest rates and contractual cash flow, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Derivative instruments are also assessed for credit valuation adjustments due to the risk of non-performance by the Company and derivative counterparties.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  In addition to the above disclosures regarding financial assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value about all financial instruments.  The following disclosure of estimated fair value of financial instruments was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value. 
  The following table presents the principal amount, carrying value and fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 
   
 _____________________________ 
           (1) 
    The fair value of other financial instruments not included in this table is estimated to approximate their carrying value. 
     Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of the reporting date.  Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect fair value, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
  Mortgage and Other Notes Payable 
  As of the reporting date, the Company believes the carrying value of its mortgage and other notes payable approximates fair value.  These fair value measurements are based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Senior Notes 
  For the Senior Notes, the Company uses available market information, which includes quoted market prices or recent transactions, if available, to estimate their fair value and are, therefore, based on observable inputs or quoted prices for similar liabilities in an active market, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
           10. 
    Risk Management and Derivative Activities 
     Derivatives 
  The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage interest rate and currency risk and such derivatives are not considered speculative.  These derivative instruments are in the form of interest cap agreements where the primary objective is to minimize interest rate risks associated with investment and financing activities and foreign currency forward agreements where the primary objective is to minimize foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with operating activities.  The counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company may also have other financial relationships.  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by these counterparties and it monitors their financial condition; however, the Company currently does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1.  Financial Statements  of this report.  References to  NorthStar Europe,   we,   us  or  our  refer to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
  Introduction 
  NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a European focused commercial real estate company with predominantly prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  Our objective is to provide our stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time.  We commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Europe, a Maryland corporation, or the Spin-off. 
  Upon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty contributed: (i) its business activities related to a multi-tenant office complex located in the United Kingdom, or the U.K. Complex, acquired on September 16, 2014; (ii) other European real estate portfolios acquired in the second and third quarters of 2015 and primarily comprised of multi-tenant office properties, or the New European Investments; and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty s European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business. 
  On November 2, 2015, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol  NRE.   We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM) which together with its affiliates is referred to as NSAM.  Substantially all of our assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and we conduct our operations, directly or indirectly, through NorthStar Realty Europe Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and our operating partnership, or our Operating Partnership.  We have elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct our operations so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
  Sales Initiatives 
  We continue to concentrate on primarily office properties in Germany, the United Kingdom and France, or the Core Markets.  As a result, we have executed a series of sales initiatives of assets outside the Core Markets with the goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value.  
  Merger Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, our external manager, NSAM, announced that it entered into a merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform, or the Mergers.  The transaction has been approved by NSAM and NorthStar Realty s respective board of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective special committees and the board of directors of Colony. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of NorthStar Realty s, Colony s and NSAM s respective stockholder approvals. 
  Summary of Business 
  Our primary business line is European real estate.  We are predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  We acquired or committed to acquire the majority of our properties in 2014.

  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows 
  We primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income from our properties.  Our income is primarily derived through the difference between revenue and the cost at which we are able to finance our investments.  We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage. 
  Profitability and Performance Metrics 
  We calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and net operating income, or NOI as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for a description of these metrics). 
  Outlook and Recent Trends 
  The European economy has been in a gradual and sustained state of recovery during the past three years and appears to have weathered the initial impact of the U.K. decision to leave the European Union, or Brexit.  In the third quarter of 2016, Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, in the European Union, or the EU, and the Euro Area grew by 1.8% and 1.6% year on year, respectively.  Unemployment in the EU stands stable at 8.5% (down from 9.2% in September 2015), the lowest level recorded since February 2009.  
  In October 2016, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, revised its full year 2016 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.1% to 1.7%, reflecting solid results in the second quarter of 2016 and a muted impact of the Brexit vote on the Euro Area economy in the third quarter.  The 2017 Euro Area outlook has been improved to 1.5%, 0.1% above the July forecast.  French GDP expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter (+0.3% above the second quarter result).  The improved performance was driven by increased household and governmental spending and production growth.  The U.K. economy, fueled by currency depreciation and a lower interest rate, performed better than generally expected since the Brexit vote, achieving 0.5% GDP growth in the third quarter.  On November 3, 2016, the Bank of England, or BoE, released revised growth for the U.K., raising its GDP growth forecast to 2.2% (+0.2%) in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017 (+0.6%), reflecting stronger than anticipated economic performance since the Brexit referendum.  There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU as well as its non-EU trading partners with whom it conducts trade through existing trade agreements that it accesses through its membership of the EU.  The process for exiting the EU is unprecedented and likely to be protracted and it is too early to assess its potential impact on the U.K., European or global economy.

On August 4, 2016, the Bank of England announced a series of measures designed to provide support to the U.K. economy including a reduction in the interest rate from 0.50% to a new record low of 0.25% and an expansion of its quantitative easing program by  70 billion.  The European Central Bank, or ECB, continues to pursue its quantitative easing program aiming to buy an average of  80 billion of corporate bonds per month and based on public statements appears ready to act further, if necessary.  Based on public statements, the ECB appears open to the prospect of its asset purchase program extension (currently running through March 2017) to ensure continued momentum in the economic recovery.  
  Our ongoing belief in a gradual and sustained recovery in Europe is underpinned by a combination of factors that are generally conducive of economic growth including low energy prices, low interest rates, a weaker Euro and Pound Sterling as well as the prospect of further central bank intervention, if necessary.  However, economic growth both globally and within the EU faces increased headwinds and remains potentially vulnerable to greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty. 
  European commercial real estate investment volume in the third quarter of 2016 was  52 billion.  Investment volume reached  163 billion for the first three quarters of 2016, 16% below the level recorded during the same period in 2015, driven by limited supply of quality stock and general market uncertainty.  The office sector, which accounted for approximately 42% of the overall 2016 investment volume, has proven relatively resilient compared to other asset classes (8% year to date decline compared to 2015).  Germany surpassed the U.K. as the most active investment market during the third quarter of 2016 ( 15 billion investment volume), led by strong activity in the office segment.  While the U.K. investment activity rose in September 2016 (5% above September 2015 volumes), driven largely by overseas investors taking advantage of Sterling s devaluation, total U.K. investment volume remained significantly below its 2015 level (36% drop), reflecting market uncertainty following Brexit in the run up and following the referendum.  
  The low interest rate environment is fueling demand from investors seeking an alternative to fixed income investments, resulting in continued downward pressure on in prime office yields.  In most European office markets, these have fallen by 10-20bps in 2016, with further compression possible. 
  Our Strategy 
  We seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time.  Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within the Core Markets.  These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe.  We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities.  We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures. 
   
  Financing Strategy 
  We seek to access a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities.  We predominantly use investment-level financing as part of our strategy to seek to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.  We target overall leverage of 40% to 50% over time, although there is no assurance that this will be the case. 
  We pursue a variety of financing arrangements such as mortgage notes and bank loans available from the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, finance companies and banks.  In addition, we may use corporate-level financing such as credit facilities and other term borrowings.  We generally seek to limit our reliance on recourse borrowings.  Borrowing levels for our investments may be dependent upon the nature of the investments and the related financing that is available. 
  In July 2015, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior stock-settlable notes due December 2016, or the Senior Notes.  We received aggregate net proceeds of $331 million, after deducting the underwriters  discount and other expenses.  Proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were distributed to subsidiaries of NorthStar Realty, which used such amounts for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, including the Trianon Tower, and the repayment of NorthStar Realty s borrowings.  The Senior Notes are our senior unsubordinated and unsecured obligations.  NorthStar Realty s operating partnership continues to guarantee payments on the Senior Notes subsequent to the Spin-off.  In February 2016, we repurchased approximately $150 million of the Senior Notes, at a slight discount to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In June 2016, we repurchased approximately $80 million of the Senior Notes, at a slight premium to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In August 2016, we repurchased approximately   $42 million   of the Senior Notes, at a slight premium to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In October 2016, we elected to settle the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity. 
  Attractive long-term, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market, financing continues to be available in the European markets.  We predominately use floating rate financing and we seek to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising through hedging arrangements including interest rate swaps and caps. 
  In May 2016, we entered into a $75 million revolving credit facility with certain commercial bank lenders.  In July 2016, the credit facility was repaid.  In October 2016, we reduced the aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility to $35 million.

Portfolio Management 
  NSAM performs portfolio management services on our behalf.  In addition, we rely on the services of local third-party service providers.  The comprehensive portfolio management process includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management team, regular management meetings and a quarterly investment review process.  These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify investment-specific issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis.  Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that such review will identify all potential issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific investments; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from investments that are not identified during these investment reviews. 
  NSAM uses many methods to actively manage our risks to seek to preserve our income and capital, which includes our ability to manage our investments and our tenants in a manner that preserves cost and income and minimizes credit losses that could decrease income and portfolio value.  Frequent re-underwriting, dialogue with tenants/partners and regular inspections of our properties have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early.  Monitoring tenant creditworthiness is an important component of our portfolio management process, which may include, to the extent available, a review of financial statements and operating statistics, delinquencies, third party ratings and market data.  During the quarterly portfolio review, or more frequently as necessary, investments may be put on highly-monitored status and identified for possible asset impairment based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, tenant rating downgrades (where applicable) and other data that may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment. 
  We may need to make unplanned capital expenditures in connection with changes in laws and governmental regulations in relation to real estate.  Where properties are being repositioned or refurbished, we may be exposed to unforeseen changes in scope to budgeted capital expenditures. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  Our combined consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., our Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries.  We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.  We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests.  We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.   
  We will evaluate our investments in unconsolidated ventures to determine whether they are a VIE.  We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  We do not consolidate a voting interest

     Table of Contents   

entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote. 
  We perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Non-controlling Interests 
  A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us.  A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the combined consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, attributable to non-controlling interests.  An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
  We account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases and goodwill.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Assets and Liabilities Held For Sale     
  Operating real estate which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale is separately presented on the combined consolidated balance sheets.  Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell net of the intangible assets associated with the asset.  Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded.  We record a gain or loss on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and we have no substantial economic involvement with the property.  If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain or loss recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. 
  Intangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities  
  We record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value.  The value allocated to the above or below-market leases is amortized net adjustment to rental income, the value of below-market ground leases is amortized into properties - operating expense and in-place leases is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the respective remaining lease term. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  We analyze goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  We first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary.  The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets.  The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with laws and regulations; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; and/or a significant change in the occupancy rate and/or rising interest rates. 
  A market approach is performed based on an income approach whereby we look at comparable properties, current market conditions, forecasts and representative transactions to validate management s expectations, where possible.  The main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the selection of guideline transactions, the derivation and selection of multiples and the financial metrics of the properties.  The starting point for each of the reporting unit s multiples is the detailed annual plan and rent roll.  The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including revenue growth rate and capital spending  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents   

requirements, among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections.  Fair value of the reporting unit is using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Rental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals, subject to indexation and expense reimbursements to be paid in quarterly or monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.  The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable on our combined consolidated balance sheets.  We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Escalation income represents revenue from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
  In a situation in which a lease or leases associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above and below market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and leasing commissions).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within depreciation and amortization in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Impairment on Investments 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Our real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if our estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  In conducting this review, we consider global macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in our combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  An allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of a tenant to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts. 
  Derivatives 
  We seek to use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.  The change in fair value for a derivative is recorded in earnings. 
  Our derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under U.S. GAAP.  Therefore, the change in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in earnings. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a functional foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents   

by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  In addition, we identified each of our properties that have non-controlling interests as VIEs.  These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights and we are the primary beneficiary.  As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our combined consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence.  Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related.  Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination, for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our combined consolidated statement of cash flows.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We require capital to fund our operating expenses and investment activities, including the repurchase of our common stock.  Our capital sources may include cash flow from operations, net proceeds from asset sales, financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, long-term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities, senior term loans, senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and perpetual preferred stock and common stock.  We predominantly use investment-level financing as part of our strategy to seek to prudently leverage our investments.  We target overall leverage of 40% to 50% over time, although there is no assurance that we will achieve our target.  We generally seek to limit our reliance on recourse borrowings. 
  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets.  Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing.  Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders  and investors  resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities. 
  As a REIT, we will be required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax.  On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects.  Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.

In connection with the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty provided us with an initial capitalization of $250 million.  In addition, in November 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.  The authorization expires in November 2016, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   2.4 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $25 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   3 million   shares of our common stock for   $31 million  .  From November 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   7 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $72 million   with   $28 million   remaining under the stock repurchase plan.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   2 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $21 million   with   $7 million   remaining under the stock repurchase plan as of November 4, 2016. 
  We currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs.  We expect our contractual rental income is sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses and common dividends declared by us.  We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions.  Unrestricted cash as of November 8, 2016 was approximately   $140 million  . 
  Senior Notes 
  In July 2015, we issued $340 million of Senior Notes for aggregate net proceeds of $331 million, after deducting the underwriters  discount and other expenses.  In February 2016, we repurchased approximately $150 million of the Senior Notes, at a slight discount to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In June 2016, we repurchased approximately $80 million of the Senior Notes, at a slight premium to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In August 2016, we repurchased approximately   $42 million   of the Senior Notes, at a slight premium to par value, through privately negotiated transactions.  In October 2016, we elected to settle the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity. 
  Credit Facility 
  In May 2016, we entered into a $75 million revolving credit facility with certain commercial bank lenders.  In July 2016, the credit facility was repaid.  In October 2016, we reduced the aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility to $35 million. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following presents a summary of our combined consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands).  The combined consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   represents our cash flow following the Spin-off on October 31, 2015.  The combined consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   represent: (i) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present; and (ii) an allocation of costs related to us.  As a result, cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   may not be comparative to our cash flows reported for the prior period presented. 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   September 30, 2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $19.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to cash used in operating activities of   $48.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily related to sales offset by repayments of investments in 2016.  
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $358.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to cash used in investing activities of   $1.9 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Cash flow provided by the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of real estate offset by improvements of our operating real estate.  Cash flow used in for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was due to the acquisitions of our New European Investments acquired in the second and third quarters 2015. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $0.5 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to cash provided by financing activities of   $2.1 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Cash flow used in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to   $273.4 million   from the repurchase of Senior Notes, the repayment of mortgage notes and other notes payable of   $190.7 million  , repayment of the credit facility of   $65.0 million  , retirement of shares of common stock

of   $29.1 million   and dividend payments of   $26.9 million   offset by   $65.0 million   from the borrowing under the credit facility.  Cash flow provided by for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was due to the financing by NorthStar Realty for the acquisition of our New European Investments in 2015. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Related Party Arrangements 
  NorthStar Asset Management Group  
  The management agreement with NSAM is for an initial term of 20 years and provides for a base management fee and incentive fee.  The management contract with NSAM commenced on November 1, 2015, and as such, there were no management fees incurred for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Base Management Fee 
  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $3.5 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively, related to the base management fee.  The base management fee to NSAM could increase subsequent to   September 30, 2016   by an amount equal to   1.5%   per annum of the sum of: 
             
    any equity we issue in exchange or conversion of exchangeable or stock-settlable notes; 
                
    any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which are structured as profits interests, or LTIP units (excluding units issued to us and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and 
                
    cumulative CAD, if any, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP Units or other equity awards which began with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
     Incentive Fee 
  For the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not incur an incentive fee.  The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to: 
             
    the product of: (a) 15% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.30 per share and up to $0.36 per share; plus   
                
    the product of: (a) 25% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.36 per share;  
                
    multiplied by our weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter. 
     Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of our common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis.  With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance.  With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction. 
  Additional Management Agreement Terms 
  If we were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by NSAM on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between us and NSAM.  The management agreement further provides that the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than our aggregate base management fee in place immediately prior to such spin-off. 
  Our management agreement with NSAM provides that in the event of a change of control of NSAM or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent.  The management agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management.  The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us or NSAM, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement.

Payment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation 
  We are responsible for all of our direct costs and expenses and reimburse NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on our behalf.  In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to us related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our management agreement with NSAM, or the G A Allocation.  Our management agreement with NSAM provides that the amount of the G A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i)   20%   of the combined total of: (a) our and NorthStar Realty s, or the NorthStar Listed Companies , general and administrative expenses as reported in their combined consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to NSAM under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar Listed Companies, or NorthStar Listed Companies  G  and (b) NSAM s general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of NSAM; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies  G A.  The G A Allocation may include our allocable share of NSAM s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs.  The G A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies  affairs.  In addition, we will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between NSAM and any of its executives, employees or other service providers. 
  In connection with the Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies  obligation to reimburse NSAM for the G A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at NSAM s discretion, and the   20%   cap on the G A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies.  NSAM currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management. 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , NSAM did not allocate to us.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , NSAM allocated   $0.1 million   to us. 
  In addition, we, together with NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for up to 50% of any long-term bonus or other compensation that NSAM s compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of NSAM during any year.  Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between NSAM and NorthStar Realty or any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, the amount paid by us, NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty will be determined by NSAM in its discretion.  At the discretion of NSAM s compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of our restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of our common stock are not available for issuance under our equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash.  Our equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of the NSAM compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual s equity compensation may be greater or less than 50%. 
  NSAM purchase of common stock 
  In June 2016, NSAM purchased   0.2 million   shares of our common stock through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.3 million  . 
   
  Recent Developments 
  Dividends  
  On   November 2, 2016  , we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock.  The common stock dividend will be paid on   November 18, 2016   to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 14, 2016  . 
  Sales 
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we sold one non-core asset with a carrying value of   $5.7 million   for   $8.7 million  .  
  Credit Facility Reduction 
  In October 2016, we reduced the aggregate commitment under the Credit Facility to   $35 million  . 
  Senior Note Settlement 
  In October 2016, we elected to settle the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity.

Share Repurchase 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   2 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $21 million   with   $7 million   remaining under the stock repurchase plan as of November 8, 2016.  On November 3, 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional   $100 million   of our outstanding common stock.  The authorization expires in November 2017, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.   
   
  Inflation 
  Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature.  As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does.  A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with inflation rates.  Substantially all of the leases allow for regular rent increase which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each matures.   
  Refer to Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  for additional details. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We use CAD and NOI, each a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate our profitability.   
  Cash Available for Distribution 
  We believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance.  We also believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, realized gain (loss) on investments, asset impairment and non-recurring bad debt expense).  We adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance.  For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions.  Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders.  The definition of CAD may be adjusted from time to time for our reporting purposes in our discretion, acting through our audit committee or otherwise.  CAD may fluctuate from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of investments, repayments and asset sales, capital raised, use of leverage, changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally.  Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determined quarterly distributions to stockholders.     
  We calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests and the following items: depreciation and amortization items including straight-line rental income or expense (excluding amortization of rent free periods), amortization of above/below market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of discount on financings and other and equity-based compensation; unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value; realized gain (loss) on investments and other (excluding accelerated amortization related to sales of investments); impairment on depreciable property; non-recurring bad debt expense; acquisition gains or losses; transaction costs; foreign currency gains (losses); impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets; and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items.  These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.     
  CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.

     Table of Contents   

The following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of   $14.0 million  , net amortization of above/below market leases of   $(0.1) million  , amortization of deferred financing costs of   $1.8 million   and amortization of equity-based compensation of   $5.2 million  . 
              (2) 
    Excludes unrealized loss relating to cash payment on derivatives. 
              (3) 
    Represents an adjustment to exclude a   $5.0 million   realized net loss related to the sale of real estate investment, a   $11.5 million   realized net gain related to foreign currency transactions, a   $0.3 million   realized loss related to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the repurchase of the Senior Notes and a   $2.3 million   realized loss related to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of our mortgage and other note payables. 
              (4) 
    Represents an adjustment to exclude   $0.3 million   of transaction costs and   $4.3 million   of taxes associated with the capital gain tax on the sale of real estate investments. 
     Net Operating Income (NOI)  
  We believe NOI is a useful metric of the operating performance of our real estate portfolio in the aggregate.  Portfolio results and performance metrics represent 100% for all consolidated investments and represent our ownership percentage for unconsolidated joint ventures.  Net operating income represents total property and related revenues, adjusted for: (i) amortization of above/below market rent; (ii) straight-line rent (except with respect to rent free period); (iii) other items such as adjustments related to joint ventures and non-recurring bad debt expense and (iv) less property operating expenses.  However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, realized gains (losses) from the sale of properties and other items under U.S. GAAP and capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of properties, all of which may be significant economic costs.  NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness.     
  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are primarily subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.  These risks are dependent on various factors beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions and political considerations.  Our market risk sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative positions are held for investment and not for trading purposes.   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Changes in interest rates affect our net income primarily related to impacts to interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings and derivatives.   
  Substantially all of our investments are financed with non-recourse mortgage notes.  We predominately use floating rate financing and we seek to generally mitigate the risk of interest rates rising through derivative instruments including interest rate caps.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in one-month GBP LIBOR, EURIBOR or the applicable index applied to our liabilities (and related derivatives) would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately   $12 million   annually, respectively.   
  A change in interest rates could affect the value of our properties, which may be influenced by changes in interest rates and credit spreads (as discussed below) because value is typically derived by discounting expected future cash flow generated by the property using interest rates plus a risk premium based on the property type and creditworthiness of the tenants.  A lower risk-free rate generally results in a lower discount rate and, therefore, a higher valuation, and vice versa; however, an increase in the risk-free rate would not impact our net income.   
  We use derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure.  These derivatives are typically in the form of interest rate cap agreements and the primary objective is to minimize interest rate risks associated with our investments and financing activities.  The counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions with which we may also have other financial relationships.  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by these counterparties and we monitor their financial condition.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , none of our derivatives qualified for hedge accounting treatment, therefore, gains (losses) resulting from their fair value measurement at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in our combined consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative and a specified spread over the applicable index.  Because the fair value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our unrealized gain (loss) in any given period.   
  Credit Risk 
  We are subject to the credit risk of the tenants of our properties.  We seek to undertake a credit evaluation of each tenant prior to acquiring properties.  This analysis includes due diligence of each tenant s business as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the underlying real estate to the tenant s core business operations.  Where appropriate, we may seek to augment the tenant s commitment to the property by structuring various credit enhancement mechanisms into the underlying leases.  These mechanisms could include security deposit requirements, letters of credit or guarantees from entities we deem creditworthy.  Additionally, we perform ongoing monitoring of creditworthiness of our tenants which is an important component of our portfolio management process.  Such monitoring may include, to the extent available, a review of financial statements and operating statistics, delinquencies, third party ratings and market data.   
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are subject to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our ownership of, or commitments to acquire, properties within Europe, predominantly the U.S. dollar/Euro and U.S. dollar/U.K. Pounds Sterling exchange rate.  As a result, changes in exchange rate fluctuations may positively or negatively affect our combined consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. dollars) from our business.  We may use several strategies to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate risk to hedge our equity and/or net income, including using local currency denominated financing and entering into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts.   
  Our properties and the rent payments under our leases for these properties are denominated predominantly in Euro and U.K. Pounds Sterling and we expect that substantially all of our future leases for properties we may acquire in Europe to be denominated in the local currency of the country in which the underlying property is located.  Additionally, our non-recourse mortgage borrowings are denominated in the same currency as the assets securing the borrowing.  A significant portion of our operating expenses and borrowings with respect to such European properties are also transacted in local currency, however we do have corporate expenses, such as our dividend, that are paid in U.S. dollar.  We report our results of operations and combined consolidated financial information in the U.S. dollars.  As a result, our results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars is impacted by fluctuations in the value of the local currencies in which we conduct our European business (refer to Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors). 
  
   52 

     Table of Contents   

In an effort to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we, and our Operating Partnership, actively manage our revenues and expenses so that we incur a significant portion of our expenses, including our operating costs and borrowings, in the same local currencies in which we receive our revenues.  In addition, subject to satisfying the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we engage in various hedging strategies, which may include currency futures, swaps, forwards and options.  We expect that these strategies and instruments may allow us to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  The counterparties to these arrangements are major financial institutions with which we may also have other financial relationships.  As of the   September 30, 2016  , we have entered into foreign currency forwards with respect to the CAD per quarter which is hedged for 14 months. 
  Based on our portfolio, a hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the applicable exchange rate to the U.S dollar applied to our assets and liabilities and related derivatives would result in an increase or decrease of net equity of approximately   $81.2 million  , respectively.  Such amount would be recorded in OCI.  In addition, we enter into derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exposure of our operating income.  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in applicable exchange rate to the U.S dollar applied to our assets and liabilities and related derivatives (excluding Senior Notes) would result in an increase or decrease of net income of approximately   $1.2 million   annually, respectively.
