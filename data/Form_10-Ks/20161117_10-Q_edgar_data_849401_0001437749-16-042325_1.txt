   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   SEPTEMBER   30, 2016 AND 2015   

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS   
     
  ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. ("we", "us", the  Company" or "ADM"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on November 24, 1969. We are a technology-based developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and derive revenues from the production and sale of electronics for medical devices and other applications; environmentally safe chemical products for industrial, medical and cosmetic uses; and, research, development, regulatory and engineering services.  
     
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and March 31, 2016 and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) have been prepared by ADM pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) including Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the condensed financial position and operating results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements and the information included under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and explanatory notes for the year ended March 31, 2016 as disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for that year. The operating results and cash flows for three and six months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the pending full year ending March 31, 2017.  
        
   NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. and its subsidiary Sonotron. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  USE OF ESTIMATES  
     
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates made by management include expected economic life and value of our medical devices, reserves, deferred tax assets, valuation allowance, impairment of long lived assets, fair value of equity instruments issued to consultants for services and fair value of equity instruments issued to others, option and warrant expenses related to compensation to employees and directors, consultants and investment banks, allowance for doubtful accounts, and warranty reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION  
     
  CHEMICAL PRODUCTS:  
     
  Revenues are recognized when products are shipped to end users. Shipments to distributors are recognized as revenue when no right of return exists.  

ELECTRONICS:   
     
  We recognize revenue from the sale of our electronic products when they are shipped to the purchaser. We offer a limited 90-day warranty on our electronics products and a limited 5-year warranty on our electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. We have no other post shipment obligations. Based on prior experience, no amounts have been accrued for potential warranty costs and actual costs were less than $2,000, for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For contract manufacturing, revenues are recognized after shipment of the completed products.   
     
  ENGINEERING SERVICES:   
     
  We provide certain engineering services, including research, development, quality control, and quality assurance services along with regulatory compliance services. We recognize revenue from engineering services as the services are provided.   
     
  NET INCOME PER SHARE  
     
  Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income per share is computed similar to basic income per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential shares had been issued and if the additional shares were dilutive.  
      
  Per share basic and diluted net income amounted to $0.01 and $0.01 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were 3,000,000 and 3,600,000 common stock equivalents at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  RECLASSIFICATION  
     
  Certain items in the prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
     
  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
     
  Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

  The following table summarizes information on all common share purchase options issued by us as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
     
  We lease our office and manufacturing facility under a non-cancelable operating lease, which expires on June 30, 2019. The Company s future minimum lease commitment at September 30, 2016 is as follows:   

Rent and real estate tax expense for all facilities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $63,000 for each period.   
     
  On August 21, 2008, the Company entered into a note payable with a commercial bank in the amount of $200,000. This note bears interest at a rate of 2% above the interest rate for the Company s savings account at this bank. Interest rates at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 2.15% for each year. The note is secured by cash on deposit with the institution, which is classified as restricted cash. Amounts outstanding under the note are payable on demand and interest is payable monthly.   
     
   NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES   
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards ("NOL")'s of approximately $2,566,000, which are due to expire through fiscal 2034.   These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Ultimate utilization of such NOL's and credits is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate taxable income in future periods and may be significantly curtailed if a significant change in   ownership occurs.  
     
  Due to the uncertainty related to future taxable income, the Company provides a partial valuation allowance for the deferred tax benefit resulting from the NOL's and depreciation and amortization. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company utilized approximately $692,000 in net operating losses and expects to utilize $2,100,000 before expiration. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the $380,000 reduction in deferred income taxes was offset by a similar reduction in the valuation allowance.  
     
   NOTE 9   DUE TO SHAREHOLDER   
       
  The Company s President has been deferring his salary and bonuses periodically to assist the Company s cash flow. There are no repayment terms or interest accruing on this liability.  
      
   NOTE 10   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   
       
  We evaluated all subsequent events from the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet through the issuance date of this report and determined that there are no events or transactions occurring during the subsequent event reporting period which require recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
  The following discussion of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
        
   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
     
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions under section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. We use forward-looking statements in our description of our plans and objectives for future operations and assumptions underlying these plans and objectives. Forward-looking terminology includes the words "may", "expects", "believes", "anticipates", "intends", "forecasts", "projects", or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to factors and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Factors which could cause such results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include those set forth under "Item. 1 Description of Business   Risk Factors" and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.          
      
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
       
   REVENUE RECOGNITION   
     
  We recognize revenue from engineering services on a project or monthly basis and contract manufacturing revenues are recognized after shipment of completed products. For the sale of our electronic products, revenues are recognized when they are shipped to the purchaser. Shipping and handling charges and costs are de minimis. We offer a limited 90-day warranty on our electronics products and a limited 5-year warranty on our electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. Historically, the amount of warranty revenue included in the sales of our electronic products have been de minimis. We have no other post shipment obligations and sales returns have been de minimis.  
     
  Revenues from sales of chemical products are recognized when products are shipped to end users.  Shipments to distributors are recognized as sales where no right of return exists.  
     
   USE OF ESTIMATES   
       
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves, deferred tax assets and valuation allowance, impairment of long-lived assets, fair value of equity instruments issued to consultants for services and fair value of equity instruments issued to others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above described items, are reasonable.  
       
   BUSINESS OVERVIEW   
       
  The Company is a technology-based developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and derives revenue from the production and sale of electronics for medical devices and other applications; environmentally safe chemical products for industrial, medical and cosmetic uses; and, research, development, regulatory and engineering services.  
     
  The Company is a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 24, 1969. Our operations are conducted through ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. ("ADM") and its subsidiary Sonotron Medical Systems, Inc. ("SMI").

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE   AND SIX   MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER   30 2016 AS COMPARED TO   SEPTEMBER   30, 2015     

12

13

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $127,457, or 10% due to an increase in electronics revenue of $168,076 offset by decreases in engineering revenue of $18,911 and a decrease in sales in our chemical division of $21,708. The increase in the electronics division is primarily the result of increased sales volume from one customer. The decrease in the chemical division is primarily the result of decreased sales volume from one customer.  
     
  Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $448,960, or 19% due to an increase in electronics revenue of $559,470 offset by decreases in engineering revenue of $14,342 and a decrease in sales in our chemical division of $96,168. The increase in the electronics division is primarily the result of increased sales volume from one customer. The decrease in the chemical division is primarily the result of decreased sales volume from one customer  
     
  Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $13,094. Gross profit for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased $149,355. The increase in gross profit in the electronics segments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from changes in the mix of products sold, as well as increased sales volume. The decrease in gross profit in the chemical segment resulted from lower sales for the quarter.  
     
  We are highly dependent upon certain customers. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 one customer accounted for 58% of our revenue. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for 57% of our revenue. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, one customer accounted for 42% of our revenue. The complete loss of or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any of our customers could cause a material and adverse change in our revenues and operating results.  
          
  Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $776,378 due mostly from the reduction of stock based compensation of $598,699 that was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $178,424 or 38%, from $475,186 to $296,762 mainly due to decreases of $193,002 in royalties and commissions and $10,762 in insurances offset by an increase in engineering and regulatory of $18,788.   
     
  Income from operations for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $862,878 due mostly from the reduction of stock based compensation of $598,699 that was recorded for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $99,042 or 13%, from $770,411 to $671,369 mainly due to decreases of $228,800 in royalties and commissions and $7,022 in insurances offset by an increase in engineering and regulatory of $68,827.   
     
  Interest income increased $514 and $891 for the three and six months ended September 20, 2016, respectively. The increase is due to increased funds invested in a money market account.   
     
  The foregoing resulted in net income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 of $428,894 and $950,124, respectively. Earnings per share were $0.01 per share for both the three months and six months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,676,761 as compared to $1,398,848 at March 31, 2016. The $277,913 increase was primarily the result of cash provided in operations during the six-month period in the amount of $293,048 offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $10,000 and cash used in investing activities of $5,135. Our cash will continue to be used for increased marketing costs, and the related administrative expenses in an attempt to increase our revenue.  We expect to have enough cash to fund operations for the next twelve months. Our note payable of $86,966 at September 30, 2016, is secured and collateralized by restricted cash of $233,215. This note bears an interest rate of 2% above the rate of the savings account. The interest rate on this note at September 30, 2016 was 2.15% and is payable upon demand.  
      
  Future Sources of Liquidity:  
     
  We expect that growth in profitable revenues and continued focus on new customers will enable us to continue to generate cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016.  

14

If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, face unanticipated cash needs or do not otherwise have sufficient cash, we may need to consider the sale of certain intellectual property which does not support the Company s operations. In addition, we have the ability to reduce certain expenses depending on the level of business operation.  
     
  Based on current expectations, we believe that our existing cash of $1,676,761 as of September 30, 2016 and other potential sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. Our ability to meet these requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  
      
   OPERATING ACTIVITIES    
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $293,048 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $439,097 for the six months ended September 30, 2015.  The cash provided during the six months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to net income of $950,124 offset by increases net operating assets of $661,848.     
     
   INVESTING ACTIVITIES   
       
  Cash was used in investing activities in the amount of $5,135 consisting of deposits in the restricted cash account in the amount of $165 and the purchase of equipment of $4,970.  
       
   FINANCING ACTIVITIES   
       
  For the six months ended September 30, 2016 net cash used in in financing activities was $10,000. Cash was used for repayments on a note from a commercial bank to facilitate our acquisition of Action Industries Unlimited, Inc. (AIU).   
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2015 was $287,000. For the six months ended September 30, 2015, $13,000 was used for repayments on a note from a commercial bank to facilitate our acquisition of Action Industries Unlimited, Inc. (AIU) and $300,000 was provided by the sale of the Company s common stock.  
       
   OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
     
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  
      
   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
     
   Concentration of Credit Risk   
     
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and our investment in ITI. We have no control over the market value of our investment in ITI.  
     
  We maintain cash and cash equivalents with FDIC insured financial institutions.  
     
   Our sales are materially dependent on a small group of customers, as noted in Note 4 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We monitor our credit risk associated with our receivables on a routine basis. We also maintain credit controls for evaluating and granting customer credit.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
  The Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in Ru1e 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting which materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.   
     
  The determination that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 are a result of:  
     
  a.  Deficiencies in Internal Control Structure Environment.  During the current year, the Company s focus was on expanding their customer base to initiate revenue production.    
     
  b.  Inadequate staffing and supervision within the accounting operations of our company.  The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents the Company from segregating duties within its internal control system. The inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews.  The Company s plan is to expand its accounting operations as the business of the Company expands.  
     
  The Company believes that the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, notwithstanding the material weaknesses we identified.   
      
   CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   
     
  NONE
