CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained
in this Annual Report, including statements regarding our anticipated future clinical and regulatory events, future financial position,
business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Forward looking
statements are generally written in the future tense and/or are preceded by words such as  may,   will, 
 should,   forecast,   could,   expect,   suggest,   believe, 
 estimate,   continue,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,  or similar
words, or the negatives of such terms or other variations on such terms or comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements
include, without limitation: the planned expanded commercialization of our products and the potential future commercialization
of our product candidates, our anticipated future cash position; the assimilation into our operations of acquired assets and entities;
our plan to acquire additional assets; the anticipated start dates, durations and completion dates, as well as the potential future
results, of our ongoing and future clinical trials; the anticipated designs of our future clinical trials; anticipated future regulatory
submissions and events; and future events under our current and potential future collaborations. These forward-looking statements
are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including without limitation the risks described in  Risk
Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K . These risks are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this Quarterly Report include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.
Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is
not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure
you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur and actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement
forward-looking statements.

Note 1   Business, Basis of Presentation and Business Combinations

Business   

Aytu BioScience, Inc. ( Aytu , the  Company 
or  we ) was incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado. Aytu was re-incorporated
in the state of Delaware on June 8, 2015. Aytu is a commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on global commercialization
of novel products in the field of urology. Aytu is currently focused on addressing significant medical needs in the areas of hypogonadism,
urological cancers, urinary tract infections, and male infertility. 

Basis of Presentation    

These unaudited financial statements represent the financial statements of Aytu. These unaudited financial
statements should be read in conjunction with Aytu s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, which included
all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management, these
unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of Aytu for the balance
sheet, the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the period ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of expected operating results for the full year. The information presented throughout
this report as of and for the period ended September 30, 2016 is unaudited. 

Through a multi-step reverse triangular merger, on April 16,
2015, Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (  Vyrix  ) and Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc. (  Luoxis  )
merged with and into our Company (herein referred to as the Merger) and we abandoned our pre-merger business plans to solely pursue
the specialty healthcare market, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis. In the Merger, we acquired the RedoxSYS, MiOXSYS and
Zertane products. On June 8, 2015, we reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and
changed our name from Rosewind Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and effected a reverse stock split in which each common stockholder
received one share of common stock for every 12.174 shares outstanding. On June 30, 2016, Aytu effected another reverse stock split
in which each common stockholder received one share of common stock for every 12 shares outstanding (herein referred to collectively
as the  Reverse Stock Splits ). All share and per share amounts in this report have been adjusted to reflect the effect
of these Reverse Stock Splits. 

Business Combination ProstaScint   

In May 2015, Aytu entered into and closed on an asset purchase
agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Seller ). Pursuant to the agreement, Aytu purchased assets related
to the Seller s product known as ProstaScint  (capromab pendetide), including certain intellectual property and contracts,
and the product approvals, inventory and work in progress (together, the  ProstaScint Business ), and assumed certain
of the Seller s liabilities, including those related to product approvals and the sale and marketing of ProstaScint. 

The purchase price consisted of the upfront payment of $1.0
million. Aytu also paid an additional $500,000 for the ProstaScint-related product inventory and $227,000 (which represents a portion
of certain FDA fees). Aytu also will pay 8% as contingent consideration on its net sales made after October 31, 2017, payable
up to a maximum aggregate payment of an additional $2.5 million. The contingent consideration was initially valued at $664,000.
The total fair value consideration for the purchase was $2.4 million. 

The Company s allocation of consideration transferred
for ProstaScint as of the purchase date of May 20, 2015 is as follows: 

Included in the intangible assets is developed technology of
$790,000, customer contracts of $720,000 and trade names of $80,000, each of which will be amortized over a ten-year period. The
amortization expense was $40,000 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, the contingent consideration had increased
to $714,000 due to accretion. 

8   

Business Combination Primsol  

In October 2015, Aytu entered into and closed on an Asset Purchase
Agreement with FSC Laboratories, Inc. (the  Seller ). Pursuant to the agreement, Aytu purchased assets related to the
Seller s product known as Primsol  (trimethoprim solution), including certain intellectual property and contracts, inventory,
work in progress and all marketing and sales assets and materials related solely to Primsol (together, the  Primsol Business ),
and assumed certain of the Seller s liabilities, including those related to the sale and marketing of Primsol arising after
the closing. 

Aytu paid $500,000 at closing for the purchase of the Primsol
Business and paid an additional $142,000, of which $102,000 went to inventory and $40,000 towards the Primsol Business, for the
transfer of the Primsol-related product inventory. We also agreed to pay an additional (a) $500,000 which was paid in April 2016,
(b) $500,000 which was paid in July 2016, and (c) $250,000 which was paid in November 2016. 

The Company s allocation of consideration transferred
for Primsol as of the purchase date of October 5, 2015 is as follows: 

Included in tangible assets is $102,000 of inventory and $80,000
of work-in-process inventory. Included in the intangible assets is developed technology of $520,000, customer contracts of $810,000
and trade names of $140,000, each of which will be amortized over a six-year period. The amortization expense was $61,000 and $0
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 

License and Supply Agreement Natesto  

In April 2016, Aytu entered into and closed a license and supply
agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto  (testosterone) nasal gel from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation,
or Acerus, which rights we acquired effective upon the expiration of the former licensee s rights, which occurred on June
30, 2016. The licensee s term runs for the greater of eight years or until the expiry of the latest to expire patent including
claims covering Natesto and until the entry on the market of at least one AB-rated generic product. 

Aytu paid Acerus an upfront fee of $2.0 million upon execution
of the agreement. In October 2016 we paid an additional $2,000,000 (the  Second Upfront ). On January 1, 2017, we will
pay an additional $4,000,000 (the  Third Upfront ). We also purchased, on April 28, 2016, an aggregate of 12,245,411
shares of Acerus common stock for Cdn. $2,534,800 (approximately US $2.0 million), with a purchase price per share equal to Cdn.
$0.207 or approximately US $0.16 per share. These shares are a held for sale trading security and are valued at fair market value.
Aytu could not dispose of these shares until after August 29, 2016 and still held these shares as of September 30, 2016. 

In addition to the upfront payments, we must make the following
one-time, non-refundable payments to Acerus within 45 days of the occurrence of the following event (provided that, the maximum
aggregate amount payable under such milestone payments will be $37,500,000): 

9   

The contingent consideration was valued at $3.2 million using
a Monte Carlo simulation, as of June 30, 2016. The fair values of the net identifiable asset acquired totaled $10.5 million which
will be amortized over eight years. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $330,000. 

As of September 30, 2016, the accretion expense was $306,000,
making the accrued payable adjusted for the present value $5.7 million. The contingent consideration accretion expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $46,000, resulting in the contingent consideration value of $3.2 million. 

Adoption of Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments, which provides guidance on the presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash
flows in order to reduce diversity in existing practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company early adopted this standard.
The primary cash flow categorization that will impact the Company will be contingent consideration payments however, no such payments
have been made to date. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, Not Adopted as
of September 30, 2016   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation
 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting . The standard includes multiple
provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share based payments. The amendments are expected to impact
net income, earnings per share, and the statement of cash flows. Implementation and administration may present challenges to companies
with significant share based payment activities. The amendments are effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period,
with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of this standard on its financial statements however, the Company believes that the impact will not be material. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842) . The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a
lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective
transition approach is required for leases for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption of this standard on its financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, 
which requires that all equity investments be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income
(other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The
amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change
in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to
measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments
in this update eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities
that are not public business entities and the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public
business entities. The amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements. 

10   

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying
the Measurement of Inventory.   ASU 2015-11 clarifies that inventory should be held at the lower of cost or net
realizable value.  Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price, less the estimated costs to complete, dispose
and transport such inventory.  ASU 2015-11 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2016.  ASU 2015-11 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2015-11
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation
of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with
early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on its financial
statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issuing ASU 2014-09, Topic 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (the  New Revenue Standard ). The amendments in this ASU provide a single model for use
in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the new ASU is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods and services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective
date of the New Revenue Standard. In 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, and ASU 2016-12 to clarify, among
other things, the implementation guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations,
and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The New Revenue Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. The amendments in this update
are to be applied on a retrospective basis, either to each prior reporting period presented or by presenting the cumulative effect
of applying the update recognized at the date of initial application. 

The New Revenue Standard will be effective for the Company in
fiscal 2019. The Company is evaluating the adoption methodology and the impact of this ASU on its financial statements. 

Note 2   Fixed Assets   

Fixed assets are recorded at cost and, once placed in service,
are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Fixed assets consist of the following: 

The depreciation expense was $19,000 and $7,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 3   Patents   

Costs of establishing patents, consisting of legal and filing
fees paid to third parties, are expensed as incurred. The fair value of the Zertane patents, determined by an independent, third
party appraisal to be $500,000, was being amortized over the remaining U.S. patent life since Aytu s acquisition of approximately
11 years. As of June 30, 2016, Aytu determined that this asset had no value because the Company is directing its resources towards
its commercial-stage products, and therefore, Aytu does not have the resources to complete the necessary clinical trials and bring
Zertane to market before the patents expire. The remaining fair value of the Zertane patents were expensed as of June 30, 2016. 

11   

The cost of the ORP related patents was $380,000 when they were
acquired and are being amortized over the remaining U.S. patent life since Aytu s acquisition of approximately 15 years.
Patents consist of the following: 

The amortization expense was $7,000 and $18,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 4   Revenue Recognition   

The $698,000 and $466,000 product and service revenue recognized
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents sales of the Company s Natesto, ProstaScint,
and Primsol products and the MiOXSYS Systems. 

The license revenue of $0 and $21,000 recognized in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents the amortization of the upfront payments received from the Company s
Zertane licensing agreements. The initial payment of $500,000 from the license agreement for Zertane with a Korean pharmaceutical
company was deferred and was being recognized over ten years. The initial payment of $250,000 from the license agreement for Zertane
with a Canadian-based supplier was deferred and was being recognized over seven years. 

At the end of fiscal 2016, Aytu determined that the Zertane
asset had no value as Aytu did not have the resources to complete the necessary clinical trials and bring it to market before the
patents expire. The remaining deferred revenue of $426,000 was recognized as of June 30, 2016. 

Note 5   Fair Value Considerations   

Aytu s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and warrant derivative liability. The carrying amounts
of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
fair value due to their short maturities. The valuation policies are determined by the Chief Financial Officer and approved by
the Company s Board of Directors. 

Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of
observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data
obtained from sources independent of Aytu. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect Aytu s assumptions of what market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows: 

Level 1:  
      Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to Aytu for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level 2:  
      Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets or that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and   

Level 3:  
      Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.   

Aytu s assets and liabilities which are measured at fair
value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.
Aytu s policy is to recognize transfers in and/or out of fair value hierarchy as of the date in which the event or change
in circumstances caused the transfer. Aytu has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed below in all periods presented. 

12   

The following table presents Aytu s financial assets and
liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, by level within the fair value
hierarchy: 

The estimated fair value of the Company s investment,
which is classified as Level 1 (quoted price is available), was $1,769,000 as of September 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of
the Company s marketable securities is determined using the quoted price in the active market based on the closing price
as of the balance sheet date. 

13   

The warrant derivative liability was valued using the Black-Scholes
valuation methodology because that model embodies all of the relevant assumptions that address the features underlying these instruments.
Significant assumptions in valuing the warrant derivative liability, based on estimates of the value of Aytu common stock and various
factors regarding the warrants, were as follows as of September 30, 2016 and at issuance: 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in
the fair value of financial liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy: 

14   

Note 6   Commitments and Contingencies   

Commitments and contingencies are described below and summarized
by the following table for the designated fiscal years ending June 30, as of September 30, 2016: 

Prescription Database   

In May 2016, Aytu entered into an agreement with a company that
will provide Aytu with prescription database information, whereby Aytu agreed to pay approximately $1.9 million over three years
for access to the database of prescriptions written for Natesto. 

Natesto   

In April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with
Acerus whereby Aytu agreed to pay $8.0 million for the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto of which $6.0 million is payable in
fiscal year 2017, $2.0 million was paid in October 2016. Additionally, Aytu is required to make the first milestone payment
of $2.5 million even if the milestone is not reached. 

Manufacturing Agreement   

In October 2015, Aytu entered into a Master Services Agreement
with Biovest International, Inc. ( Biovest ). The agreement provides that Aytu may engage Biovest from time to time
to provide services in accordance with mutually agreed upon project addendums and purchase orders. Aytu expects to use the agreement
from time to time for manufacturing services, including without limitation, the manufacturing, processing, quality control testing,
release or storage of its products for the ProstaScint product. Aytu is obligated to pay Biovest $2.5 million for time and materials
as they develop a plan to reproduce the manufacturing process. Of this commitment, $2.0 million was paid in fiscal 2016 and $500,000
was paid in July 2016. 

ProstaScint Commercial Supply Agreement   

In September 2016, Aytu entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement
with Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing, Inc. ( GRAM ). The agreement provides that Aytu may engage GRAM from time to
time to provide services in accordance with mutually agreed upon work orders. Aytu expects to use the agreement from time to time
for the filling, labeling, and packaging of its ProstaScint product. Aytu is obligated to pay GRAM approximately $1.7 million for
process development and production services used to fill, package, inspect, label, and test ProstaScint for distribution. As of
September 30, 2016, Aytu has not made any payments to GRAM. 

Service Agreement   

In July 2015, Aytu entered into an agreement with Ampio whereby
Aytu agreed to pay Ampio a set amount per month for shared overhead which includes costs related to the shared facility, corporate
staff, and other miscellaneous overhead expenses. This agreement was amended on November of 2015, April of 2016 and again in July
2016 resulting in an amount of $17,000 per month. This agreement will be in effect until it is terminated in writing by both parties. 

Primsol   

In October 2015, Aytu entered into an asset purchase agreement
with FSC Laboratories, Inc., or FSC. Pursuant to the agreement, we purchased assets related to FSC s product known as Primsol
(trimethoprim solution), including certain intellectual property and contracts, inventory, work in progress and all marketing and
sales assets and materials related solely to Primsol (together, the   Primsol Business  ), and assumed
certain of FSC s liabilities, including those related to the sale and marketing of Primsol arising after the closing. We
paid $500,000 at closing for the Primsol Business and we paid an additional $142,000, of which $102,000 went to inventory and $40,000
towards the Primsol Business, for the transfer of the Primsol-related product inventory. We also paid $500,000 in April of 2016
and $500,000 in July of 2016 and paid the remaining $250,000 in November 2016 (together, the   Installment Payments  ),
for a total purchase price of $1.9 million. The amount is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. 

15   

Office Lease    

In June 2015, Aytu entered into a 37 month operating lease for
a space in Raleigh, North Carolina. This lease has initial base rent of $3,000 a month, with total base rent over the term of the
lease of approximately $112,000. In September 2015, the Company entered into a 37 month operating lease in Englewood, Colorado.
This lease has an initial base rent of $9,000 a month with a total base rent over the term of the lease of approximately $318,000.
The Company recognizes rental expense of the facilities on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Differences between
the straight-line net expenses on rent payments are classified as liabilities between current deferred rent and long-term deferred
rent. Rent expense for the respective periods is as follows: 

Sponsored Research Agreement with Related Party    

In June 2013, Luoxis entered into a sponsored research agreement
with TRLLC, an entity controlled by Ampio s director and Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Bar-Or. The agreement, which
was amended in January 2015, provides for Luoxis (now Aytu) to pay $6,000 per month to TRLLC in consideration for services related
to research and development of the Oxidation Reduction Potential platform. In March 2014, Luoxis also agreed to pay a sum of $615,000
which is being amortized over the contractual term of 60.5 months and is divided between current and long-term on the balance sheet;
as of September 2014, this amount had been paid in full. This agreement is set to expire in March 2019 but can be terminated earlier
but not until after March 2017. 

Note 7   Convertible Promissory Notes   

During July and August 2015, Aytu closed on note purchase agreements
with institutional and high net worth individual investors for the purchase and sale of convertible promissory notes ( Notes )
with an aggregate principal amount of $5.2 million. The sale of the Notes was pursuant to a private placement. Debt issuance costs
totaled $401,000, which include the $103,000 fair value of the placement agent warrants. 

The Notes were an unsecured obligation. Aytu did not have the
right to prepay the Notes prior to the maturity date. Interest accrued on the Notes in the following amounts: (i) 8% simple
interest per annum for the first six months and (ii) 12% simple interest per annum thereafter if not converted during the
first nine months. Interest accrued, was payable with the principal upon maturity, conversion or acceleration of the Notes and
could have been paid in kind or in cash, in Aytu s sole discretion. 

Placement agents for the offering sold the institutional portion
of the offering of the Notes. Aytu sold the balance of the Notes to individuals and entities with whom Aytu had an established
relationship. For Notes sold by the placement agent, Aytu paid the placement agent 8% of the gross proceeds of Notes sold by the
placement agents and was obligated to issue warrants for an amount of shares equal to 8% of the gross number of shares of the Company
stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes issued to investors introduced to the Company by the private placement agents in the
private placement, in addition to a previously paid non-refundable retainer fee of $20,000. The placement agent warrants have a
term of five years from the date of issuance of the related notes in July and August 2015, an exercise price equal to the conversion
price per share at which the Notes are converted into common stock. Change in fair value is recorded in earnings. Fair value at
the grant date was recorded as a debt discount and amortized over the term of the debt. 

The warrants were recorded at fair value as long-term liabilities
on the Balance Sheet and upon conversion were moved to equity classification. 

Upon Aytu s adoption of ASU 2015-3, the issuance costs
associated with the Notes were recorded as a long term liability and were presented in the Balance Sheet as a direct reduction
of the carrying amount of the Notes on their inception date. 

16   

Pursuant to the terms of the convertible promissory note agreements,
if Aytu sold equity securities at any time while the notes were outstanding in a financing transaction that was not a Qualified
Financing (a public offering of Aytu stock resulting in gross proceeds of at least $5.0 million (excluding indebtedness converted
in such financing) prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the holders of the convertible promissory notes had the option, but
not the obligation, to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest as of the closing of such financings into a number
of shares of Aytu capital stock in an amount equal to 120% of the number of such shares calculated by dividing the outstanding
principal and accrued interest by the lesser of (a) the lowest cash price per share paid by purchasers of shares in such financing,
or (b) $4.63. As a result of Aytu s sale of common stock on January 20, 2016, the Company was obligated to provide notice
to the above-referenced noteholders of such stock sales. In accordance with the convertible note terms, noteholders had the option
to convert their entire balance (inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest) into a number of shares of Aytu common stock equal to
120% of the number of shares calculated by dividing such note balance by $7.80, which was the per share purchase price paid in
the equity financing described above. On February 10, 2015, the date of the conversion, an aggregate of $4,125,000 of principal
and $143,000 of accrued interest on the notes converted into an aggregate of 656,591 shares of Aytu s common stock under
the original terms of the agreement. 

In May 2016, Aytu completed a registered public offering which
was considered a Qualified Financing and all outstanding notes were automatically converted on the same terms as in the offering.
At the insistence of the underwriters of the offering, all outstanding noteholders had signed lockup agreements which granted them
an extra 10% on the conversion, increasing it to 130% of shares calculated by dividing such note balance by $4.80, which was the
per share purchase price in the registered offering. On May 6, 2016, the date of conversion, an aggregate of $1,050,000 of principal
and $78,000 of accrued interest on the notes converted into an aggregate of 305,559 shares of Aytu s common stock and 305,559
warrants. 

In connection with the conversion of the Aytu notes, Aytu was
obligated to issue to the placement agents for the convertible note offering warrants for an amount of shares equal to 8% of the
number of shares of Aytu s common stock for the notes sold by the placement agents issued upon conversion of the notes. As
a result of the optional note conversion, on February 10, 2016, Aytu issued warrants to the placement agents to purchase an aggregate
of 22,254 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share. As a result of the second note conversion, on May 6,
2016, Aytu issued warrants to the placement agents to purchase an aggregate of 22,564 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $4.80 per share. These warrants are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance of the related notes in July and August
2015. The warrants have a cashless exercise feature. 

Also in connection with the conversion of the notes, Aytu recorded
a beneficial conversion feature of $4.9 million which was recorded as a debt discount; this amount represents that carrying amount
of the notes at the date of conversion. The beneficial conversion feature was expensed upon conversion of the notes to interest
expense. 

Note 8   Common Stock   

Capital Stock    

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, Aytu had 5,110,591
and 3,741,944 common shares outstanding, respectively, and no preferred shares outstanding at either September 30, 2016 or June
30, 2016. The Company has 100 million shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.0001 per share and 50 million
shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.0001 per share. 

In May 2016, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $7.5
million through a public offering of 1,562,500 Units. Offering costs totaled $1.2 million resulting in net proceeds of $6.3 million.
Each Unit consists of one share of Aytu common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of Aytu common stock. The common stock
issued had a relative fair value of $4.2 million. The warrants have an exercise price of $6.00 per share and will expire five years
from the date of issuance. These warrants have a relative fair value of $2.1 million. We also granted the underwriters a 45-day
option (the Over-Allotment Option) to purchase up an additional 234,375 shares of common stock and/or warrants. The underwriters
exercised 170,822 of this over-allotment option for the warrants and paid $0.12 per over-allotment warrant. These warrants have
the same terms as the warrants sold in the registered offering. These warrants have a relative fair value of $20,000, which was
the purchase price per the underwriting agreement. 

On June 30, 2016, Aytu effected a reverse stock split in which
each common stock holder received one share of common stock for each 12 shares. All share and per share amounts for all periods
presented in this report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse stock split. 

In July 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the   Purchase
Agreement  ), together with a registration rights agreement (the   Registration Rights Agreement  ),
with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (  Lincoln Park  ). Upon signing the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park
agreed to purchase 133,690 shares of our common stock for $500,000 as an initial purchase under the agreement. We also issued as
a commitment fee to Lincoln Park of 52,500 shares of common stock. In September 2016, Lincoln Park purchased an additional 40,000
shares for $131,000, the issuance costs related to these purchases totaled $24,000, resulting in net proceeds for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 of $607,000. 

17   

In July 2016, we issued 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock
as compensation to certain executive officers and directors, which vest on July 7, 2026. 

In August 2016, we issued an aggregate of 142,457 shares of
common stock as bonuses for performance in 2016 to three executive officers. 

Note 9   Equity Instruments   

Stock Option Repricing   

In July 2016, our Board of Directors approved a common stock
option repricing program whereby previously granted and unexercised options held by current employees, consultants and directors
with exercise prices above $6.00 per share were repriced on a one-for-one basis to $3.23 per share which represented the per share
fair value of our common stock as of the date of the repricing. There was no other modification to the vesting schedule of the
previously issued options. As a result, 316,051 unexercised options originally granted to purchase common stock at prices ranging
from $6.72 to $18.12 per share were repriced under this program. 

We treated the repricing as a modification of the original awards
and calculated additional compensation costs for the difference between the fair value of the modified award and the fair value
of the original award on the modification date. The repricing resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $318,000.
Expense related to vested shares was expensed on the repricing date and expense related to unvested shares is being amortized over
the remaining vesting period of such stock options. 

Options    

On June 1, 2015, Aytu s stockholders approved the
2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), which provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock and other equity awards for up to an aggregate of 833,334 shares of common stock. The shares of common
stock underlying any awards that are forfeited, canceled, reacquired by Aytu prior to vesting, satisfied without any issuance of
stock, expire or are otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2015 Plan will be added back to the shares of common
stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. 

Pursuant to the 2015 Stock Plan, 833,334 shares of its
common stock, were reserved for issuance. The fair value of options granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding components of the
model, including the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected
dividend yield and expected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation. Aytu
estimates the expected term based on the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the options. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of similar
maturity. The assumptions used for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

18   

Stock option activity is as follows: 

Stock-based compensation expense related to the fair value
of stock options was included in the statements of operations as research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative
expenses as set forth in the table below. Aytu determined the fair value as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and expenses the fair value ratably over the vesting period. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015: 

Warrants    

A summary of all warrants is as follows: 

Included in the warrant balance at June 30, 2016 are warrants
to purchase common stock of 109,375 issued to the underwriters of our May registered offering. These warrants are currently accounted
for under liability accounting and are fair valued at each reporting period (see Note 5). At September 30, 2016, these warrants
had a fair value of $347,000. 

19   

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Aytu issued
warrants to purchase 84,918 shares of common stock to initial investors of the Company at an exercise price of $4.00 and a term
of five years from July 2016. These warrants are accounted for under equity treatment. 

All warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. In order to calculate the fair value of the warrants, certain assumptions were made regarding components of the model, including
the closing price of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life.
Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation. The Company estimated a volatility factor utilizing
a weighted average of comparable published volatilities of peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of similar maturity. 

Significant assumptions in valuing the warrants issued during
the September 30, 2016 quarter were as follows: 

Note 10   Related Party Transactions   

Ampio Loan Agreements   

On April 16, 2015, Ampio received 396,816 shares of common
stock of Aytu for (i) issuance to Aytu of a promissory note from Ampio in the principal amount of $10.0 million, maturing
on the first anniversary of the Merger, and (ii) cancellation of indebtedness of $12.0 million to Ampio. The $10.0 million

Note 11   Subsequent Events  

On October 27, 2016, we priced an underwritten
public offering of 5,735,000 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,735,000 shares of its
common stock at a combined public offering price of $1.50 per share and related warrant. The gross proceeds from the
offering to Aytu are expected to be approximately $8.6 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by Aytu, but excluding the exercise proceeds of any warrants. The company also has granted the representative
of the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 860,250 shares and/or 860,250 additional warrants. The shares
of common stock will be immediately separable from the warrants and will be issued separately. The warrants are exercisable immediately
upon issuance, expire five years after the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $1.86 per share.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This discussion should be read in conjunction with Aytu BioScience,
Inc. s Form 10-K filed on September 1, 2016. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors included in Aytu s Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 1, 2016.

Overview    

We are a commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused
on global commercialization of novel products in the field of urology. We are currently focused on addressing significant medical
needs in the areas of hypogonadism, urological cancers, urinary tract infections and male infertility. 

Through a multi-step reverse triangular merger, on April 16,
2015, Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (  Vyrix  ) and Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc. (  Luoxis  )
merged with and into our Company (herein referred to as the Merger) and we abandoned our pre-merger business plans to solely pursue
the specialty healthcare market, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis. In the Merger, we acquired the RedoxSYS, MiOXSYS and
Zertane products. On June 8, 2015, we reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and
changed our name from Rosewind Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and effected a reverse stock split in which each common stock
holder received one share of common stock for every 12.174 shares outstanding. On June 30, 2016, we effected another reverse stock
split in which each common stock holder received one share of common stock for each 12 shares. All share and per share amounts
in this report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of these two reverse stock splits (herein referred to collectively as the
Reverse Stock Splits). 

In May 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to which we purchased assets related to Jazz Pharmaceuticals  product known as ProstaScint
(capromab pendetide), including certain intellectual property and contracts, and the product approvals, inventory and work in progress
(together, the   ProstaScint Business  ), and assumed certain of Jazz Pharmaceuticals  liabilities,
including those related to product approvals and the sale and marketing of ProstaScint. The purchase price consisted of the upfront
payment of $1.0 million. We also paid an additional $500,000 within five days after transfer for the ProstaScint-related product
inventory and $227,000 was paid on September 30, 2015 (which represents a portion of certain FDA fees). We also will pay 8% on
net sales made after October 31, 2017, payable up to a maximum aggregate payment of an additional $2.5 million. 

In October 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement
with FSC Laboratories, Inc., or FSC. Pursuant to the agreement, we purchased assets related to FSC s product known as Primsol
(trimethoprim solution), including certain intellectual property and contracts, inventory, work in progress and all marketing and
sales assets and materials related solely to Primsol (together, the   Primsol Business  ), and assumed
certain of FSC s liabilities, including those related to the sale and marketing of Primsol arising after the closing. We
paid $500,000 at closing for the Primsol Business and we paid an additional $142,000, of which $102,000 went to inventory and $40,000
towards the Primsol Business, for the transfer of the Primsol-related product inventory. We also paid $500,000 in April of 2016,
$500,000 in July of 2016, and $250,000 in November of 2016, for a total purchase price of $1,892,000. 

In October 2015, we and Biovest International, Inc., or Biovest,
(whose contract manufacturing business is now known as Cell Culture Company, or C3) entered into a Master Services Agreement, pursuant
to which Biovest is to provide manufacturing services to us for our product ProstaScint. The agreement provides that we may engage
Biovest from time to time to provide services in accordance with mutually agreed upon project addendums and purchase orders for
ProstaScint. We expect to use the agreement from time to time for manufacturing services, including without limitation, the manufacturing,
processing, quality control testing, release or storage of ProstaScint. The agreement provides customary terms and conditions,
including those for performance of services by Biovest in compliance with project addendums, industry standards, regulatory standards
and all applicable laws. Biovest will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all governmental approvals, at our expense,
during the term of the agreement. The agreement has a term of four years, provided that either party may terminate the agreement
or any project addendum under the agreement on 30 days written notice of a material breach under the agreement. In addition, we
may terminate the agreement or any project addendum under the agreement upon 180 days written notice for any reason. 

In April 2016, we entered into a license and supply agreement
to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto nasal gel from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Acerus, which rights we received
on July 1, 2016. We paid Acerus an upfront fee of $2.0 million upon execution of the agreement. In October 2016 we paid an additional
$2.0 million. In January of 2017, we will pay an additional $4.0 million. We also purchased on April 28, 2016, an aggregate of
12,245,411 shares of Acerus common stock for Cdn. $2,534,800 (approximately US $2.0 million), with a purchase price per share equal
to Cdn. $0.207 or approximately US $0.16 per share. We could not dispose of these shares until after August 29, 2016 and still
hold these shares as of the date of this Report on Form 10-Q. We also agreed to make various payments up to an aggregate of $37.5
million based on net sales of Natesto. During the term of the agreement, we will purchase all of our Natesto product needs from
Acerus at a designated price. 

In May 2016, we sold in an underwritten public offering 1,562,500
shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 1,562,500 shares of common
stock at a combined public offering price of $4.80 per share and related warrant. Each warrant is exercisable for five years from
issuance and has an exercise price equal to $6.00. In addition, we granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an
additional 234,375 shares of common stock and/or 234,375 additional warrants. The underwriters elected a partial exercise of their
over-allotment option to purchase 170,822 warrants. The net cash proceeds from the sale of the shares and warrants was approximately
$6.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

21   

In July 2016, Aytu issued 1.0 million shares of restricted stock
to executive officers and directors. 

In July 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the  Purchase
Agreement ), together with a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln
Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park ), an Illinois limited liability company. Upon signing the Purchase Agreement,
Lincoln Park agreed to purchase 133,690 shares of our common stock for $500,000 as an initial purchase under the agreement. We
also issued as a commitment fee to Lincoln Park of 52,500 shares of common stock. In September 2016, Lincoln Park purchased an
additional 40,000 shares for $131,000. 

Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, we have the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to an additional $10.0 million in amounts
of shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on September
20, 2016 (the date that the registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, was declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith
was filed. As part of the registered offering that we completed in October 2016, we agreed not to sell any shares under this agreement
for a period of 90 days from October 28, 2016. 

In September 2016, Aytu entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement
with Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing, Inc. ( GRAM ). The agreement provides that Aytu may engage GRAM from time to
time to provide services in accordance with mutually agreed upon work orders. Aytu expects to use the agreement from time to time
for the filling, labeling, and packaging of its ProstaScint product. Aytu is obligated to pay GRAM approximately $1.7 million for
process development and production services used to fill, package, inspect, label, and test ProstaScint for distribution. As of
September 30, 2016, Aytu has not made any payments to GRAM. 

On October 27, 2016, we priced an underwritten
public offering of 5,735,000 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,735,000 shares of its
common stock at a combined public offering price of $1.50 per share and related warrant. The gross proceeds from the
offering to Aytu are expected to be approximately $8.6 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by Aytu, but excluding the exercise of any warrants. The company also has granted the representative of the underwriters
a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 860,250 shares and/or 860,250 additional warrants. The shares of common stock will
be immediately separable from the warrants and will be issued separately. The warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance,
expire five years after the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $1.86 per share. 

As of the date of this Report, we have financed operations through
a combination of private and public debt and equity financings including net proceeds from the private placements of stock and
convertible notes. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our current operating plan, as of
the date of this Report, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for fiscal 2017.
See  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

We have only begun to generate revenues from the commercialization
of our product candidates in the last fiscal year. We recognized approximately $2.1 million in revenue from ProstaScint, Primsol
and RedoxSYS sales during fiscal 2016 and $698,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We have incurred accumulated
net losses since our inception, and at September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $52.3 million. Our net loss was $5.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and we used $5.3 million in cash from operations during the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Product Update   

We continue to execute our business plan and progress forward
on the commercialization of our FDA approved products Natesto, ProstaScint, and Primsol and on the development of our MiOXSYS product
candidate. 

NATESTO  

In April 2016, we signed an exclusive licensing agreement with
Acerus Pharmaceuticals SRL for U.S. rights to Natesto (testosterone) nasal gel. Natesto is the only FDA-approved nasal formulation
of testosterone, and it is an androgen indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or
absence of endogenous testosterone including primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital
or acquired). Natesto has been shown to normalize testosterone in hypogonadal men and does not have a black box warning as other
topically applied testosterone products do. By virtue of the fact that Natesto is applied through the nostrils, there is almost
no risk of testosterone transference, an issue present with all other topically-applied testosterone products. Acerus Pharmaceuticals
previously licensed Natesto to Endo Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Natesto was approved by the FDA in May 2014, and we commenced U.S.
commercialization of Natesto in July 2016 following a transition period from April 22, 2016 through June 20, 2016. 

22   

PROSTASCINT  

In May 2015, we acquired ProstaScint (capromab pendetide) from
Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint is the only commercially available diagnostic imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration ( FDA ) that specifically targets Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). This imaging agent assists
in the identification of prostate cells to determine the cells  location as confirmation that theyare either contained within
the prostate gland or that they have spread to tissue outside of the prostate gland. ProstaScint consists of a novel murine monoclonal
antibody that, when conjugated to a linker-chelator and radiolabeled, binds distinctly to PSMA. PSMA is a glycoprotein expressed
by prostate epithelium, which is up regulated in prostate cancer. ProstaScint was approved by the FDA in October 1996 and was initially
commercialized by Cytogen which was acquired by EUSA Pharma. Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired EUSA Pharma and its product portfolio
including ProstaScint in 2012. 

PRIMSOL  

In October 2015 we acquired Primsol (trimethoprim hydrochloride)
from FSC Laboratories, Inc. Primsol  is the only FDA-approved trimethoprim-only
oral solution and is a standard therapy for urinary tract infections. Primsol is a sulfa-free, pleasant tasting liquid that
is appropriate for patients that are sulfa allergic and individuals that have difficulty swallowing pills.  Trimethoprim
alone has been shown to be effective against common strains of urinary tract pathogens including  Escherichia coli ,  Enterobacter
species ,  Klebsiella pneumoniae ,  Proteus mirabilis , and  Staphylococcus saprophyticus . Primsol was approved
by the FDA in 2000 and was originally marketed by Ascent Pediatrics. FSC Laboratories acquired Primsol from Taro Pharmaceutical. 

MIOXSYS  

MiOXSYS is our CE Marked clinical diagnostic device used in
the assessment of male infertility. MiOXSYS is a small, portable device that is used in conjunction with semen analysis tests (sperm
motility, concentration, and morphology) and measures oxidative stress in seminal plasma. MiOXSYS employs the measurement of oxidation-reduction
potential (ORP) to detect overall oxidative stress levels. Oxidative stress has repeatedly been shown to be a major causal factor
in idiopathic male infertility, which accounts for a significant portion of male infertility cases. Semen analysis studies are
routinely conducted to assess causes of infertility, so we expect clinicians and oxidative stress researchers to readily integrate
MiOXSYS into routine adjunct use. We anticipate initiating U.S. studies in order to gain FDA clearance as a 510k de novo medical
device. 

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Significant Accounting Policies and
Estimates   

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates
and judgments, including those related to recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, stock compensation, valuation
of derivative instruments, allowances and contingencies. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, and judgments used by us in
applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Our
significant accounting policies and estimates are included in our Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on September 1, 2016. 

Information regarding our accounting policies and estimates
can be found in the Notes to the Financial Statements. 

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Information regarding the recently issued accounting standards
(adopted and not adopted as of September 30, 2016) is combined in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Results of Operations   September
30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015   

Results of operations for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflected losses of approximately $5.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
These losses include in part non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and accretion, compensation
through issuance of stock, warrant derivative expense, unrealized gain on investment, issuance of warrants to initial investors,
and amortization of prepaid research and development   related party offset by the unrealized gain on investment in the amount
of $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $228,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The non-cash
charges increased in the three months ended 2016 primarily due to the increase in stock-compensation expense, the amortization
of intangible assets, derivative expense, compensation through issuance of common stock and issuance of warrants. 

Revenue    

Product and service revenue  

We recognized $698,000 and $466,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the sale of our products Natesto, ProstaScint, and Primsol, as well as the
MiOXSYS System due to our acquisitions and expended marketing of our products. 

As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product
sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. Provisions for these deductions are recorded
concurrently with the recognition of gross product sales revenue and include discounts, chargebacks, distributor fees, processing
fees, as well as allowances for returns and Medicaid rebates. Provision balances relating to estimated amounts payable to direct
customers are netted against accounts receivable and balances relating to indirect customers are included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities. The provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales and net product sales are as follows: 

License revenue  

The license revenue of $0 and $21,000 recognized in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents the amortization of the upfront payments received from the Company s
license agreements. In 2012, we received a payment of $500,000 under our out-license agreement for Zertane with a Korean pharmaceutical
company. This payment was deferred and was being recognized over 10 years. In 2014, we received a payment of $250,000 under our
out-license agreement for Zertane with a Canadian-based supplier. This payment was deferred and was being recognized over seven
years. At June 30, 2016, Aytu determined that the Zertane asset has no value as Aytu does not have the resources to complete the
necessary clinical trials and bring it to market before the patents expire. Therefore, the remaining unamortized deferred revenue
of $426,000 which was outstanding as of the date it was determined not to proceed with the clinical trials was recognized as of
June 30, 2016. 

Expenses    

Cost of Sales    

The cost of sales of $192,000 and $37,000 recognized for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are related to the Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol products and
the MiOXSYS Systems. We expect to see cost of sales continue to increase in fiscal 2017 as we expect our sales to continue to grow. 

24   

Research and Development    

Research and development costs consist of clinical trials and
sponsored research, manufacturing transfer expense, labor, stock-based compensation, sponsored research   related party and
consultants and other. These costs relate solely to research and development without an allocation of general and administrative
expenses and are summarized as follows: 

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Research and development expenses decreased $624,000, or 69.0%,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was due primarily to
switching our focus towards our commercial products and eliminating expenses related to Zertane. We anticipate additional research
and development expense during fiscal 2017 as we expect we will be completing a clinical trial for the MiOXSYS System as well as
completing the manufacturing tech transfer for our ProstaScint product. 

Selling, General and Administrative    

General and administrative expenses consist of labor costs including
personnel costs for employees in executive, commercial,business development and operational functions; stock-based compensation;
patents and intellectual property; professional fees including legal, auditing, accounting, investor relations, shareholder expense
and printing and filing of SEC reports; occupancy, travel and other including rent, governmental and regulatory compliance, insurance,
and professional subscriptions; directors fees; and management fee   related party. These costs are summarized as follows: 

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

General and administrative costs increased $4.1 million, or
248.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in labor
costs, stock-based compensation, and occupancy, travel and other primarily relates to increased costs related to the increase in
professional staffing due to our commercialization efforts for our Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol products. We expect general
and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2017 due to the expected overall growth of our company. 

25   

Amortization of Intangible Assets  

Amortization of intangible assets was $437,000 and $57,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. This expense increased
due to the acquisition of the Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol businesses in late fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively, and
the corresponding amortization of their finite-lived intangible assets. As we continue to license and purchase additional assets
as part of our business strategy we would expect this non-cash expense to continue to grow.   

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities    

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating
activities used $5.3 million in cash which was slightly less than the net loss of $5.7 million, primarily as a result of the non-cash
depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation offset by the unrealized gain on investment, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities, and accrued compensation. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our operating
activities used $2.2 million in cash which was slightly less than the net loss of $2.3 million, primarily as a result of the non-cash
depreciation, amortization and accretion and the increase in accrued compensation offset by inventory and accounts payable. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities    

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash
in investing activities of $505,000, $5,000 of which was used to purchase fixed assets and $500,000 of which was paid as the second
installment towards the Primsol asset. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, cash of $4,000
was used to purchase fixed assets. 

Net Cash from Financing Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 of $607,000 was primarily related to the common stock issuance of $631,000 offset by the issuance costs
of $24,000 to Lincoln Park. 

Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months
ended September 30, 2015 of $4.9 million was primarily related to the convertible promissory notes which reflects gross proceeds
of $5.2 million offset by the cash portion of the debt issuance costs related to the Notes of $298,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

We are a relatively young company and we have not yet generated
substantial revenue as our primary activities are focused on commercializing our approved products, acquiring products and developing
our product candidates, and raising capital. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.7 million
available to fund our operations offset by an aggregate of $8.2 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the Natesto
payables. In October 2016, we spent $2.0 million for the second installment payment of our Natesto licensing agreement. We have
a remaining commitment of $4.0 million during fiscal year 2017. In October 2016, we completed a registered public offering of
common stock and warrants for $7.7 million in proceeds, net of expenses. Based upon our resources at September 30, 2016 as well
as the additional funding we received in October and our ability to sell additional capital to Lincoln Park and funds we will
receive if we sell the investment in Acerus, we believe we have adequate capital to continue operations through fiscal 2017. We
will evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine when to raise additional capital in the form of equity, convertible
debt or other financing instruments, depending on market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time. We will seek
to raise additional capital at such time as we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the
best interests of our Company and our stockholders. 

We have prepared a budget for fiscal 2017 which reflects cash
requirements from operations of approximately $3.0 million per quarter with the cash burn being higher in the first half of the
year as compared to the second half due to our projected increase in revenues during the second half of the fiscal year. Depending
on the availability of capital, we may expend additional funds for the purchase of assets and commercialization of products. Accordingly,
it may be necessary to raise additional capital and/or enter into licensing or collaboration agreements. At this time, we expect
to satisfy our future cash needs through private or public sales of our securities or debt financings. We cannot be certain that
financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Over the last three years, including recently, volatility in
the financial markets has adversely affected the market capitalizations of many bioscience companies and generally made equity
and debt financing more difficult to obtain. This volatility, coupled with other factors, may limit our access to additional financing. 

If we cannot raise adequate additional capital in the future
when we require it, we could be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our commercialization efforts
or our research and development programs. We also may be required to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at
less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. This may lead to impairment or other charges, which could materially affect
our balance sheet and operating results. 

26   

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated
entities or other persons, also known as  variable interest entities.  

Item 3.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We are not currently exposed to material market risk arising
from financial instruments, changes in interest rates or commodity prices, or fluctuations in foreign currencies. We have not identified
a need to hedge against any of the foregoing risks and therefore currently engages in no hedging activities. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures.   

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the reports we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and are operating in an effective manner. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item  1. Legal
Proceedings.   

We are currently not a party to any material pending legal proceedings,
whether routine or non-routine. 

Item 1A. Risk
Factors.   

Except as set forth below, there
have been no material changes to the discussion of risk factors included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

There is not now and may not be an active liquid trading
market for our publicly traded warrants.  

There is no established public trading market for our publicly
traded warrants issued in May and October 2016 and that trade on the OTCQX. There is no assurance that an active trading market
will develop or if one develops that it will be maintained. Although we plan to apply to apply to have the warrants listed on the
NYSE MKT, there is no assurance any application will be approved, or even if it is approved, that an active trading market will
develop or if one develops that it will be maintained. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will remain limited. 

In the event we are unable to maintain an effective registration
statement with respect to all of the shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, we
may not be able to access the full amount available under the Purchase Agreement.  

The registration statement we have filed with the SEC for the
resale of shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, does not register all of the
shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. In order to access the Purchase Agreement beyond the shares
offered thereunder, we must have an effective registration statement on file for any amount of shares in excess of the 1,155,136
shares registered and offered thereby. For us to issue additional shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will have to file
one or more registration statements for those additional shares. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so, or
that the SEC will declare effective any registration statement that we may file. If we do not file and maintain an effective registration
statement for the resale of additional shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will be unable to access any additional
funds that may be available under the Purchase Agreement. If we were unable to access a portion or the full remaining amount available
to us under the Purchase Agreement, in the absence of any other financing sources, it would have a material adverse impact on our
operations.
