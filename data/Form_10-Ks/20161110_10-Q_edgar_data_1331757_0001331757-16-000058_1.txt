FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF DALLAS 
  NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying interim financial statements of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the  Bank ) are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions provided by Article 10, Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The financial statements contain all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the Bank s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other interim period. 
  The Bank s significant accounting policies and certain other disclosures are set forth in the notes to the audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The interim financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction with the Bank s audited financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on   March 22, 2016   (the    2015   10-K ). The notes to the interim financial statements update and/or highlight significant changes to the notes included in the   2015   10-K. 
  The Bank is one of 11 district Federal Home Loan Banks, each individually a  FHLBank  and collectively the  FHLBanks,  and, together with the Office of Finance, a joint office of the FHLBanks, the  FHLBank System.  The Office of Finance manages the sale and servicing of the FHLBanks  consolidated obligations. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( Finance Agency ), an independent agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government, supervises and regulates the housing government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), including the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. 
         Use of Estimates and Assumptions.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. Significant estimates include the valuations of the Bank s investment securities, as well as its derivative instruments and any associated hedged items. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Note 2 Recently Issued Accounting Guidance 
       Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   On April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03   "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs"   ("ASU 2015-03").     ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the statement of condition as a direct deduction from that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. For public business entities, the guidance in ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 (January 1, 2016 for the Bank). The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospective basis to each individual period presented on the statement of condition. Accordingly,   $1,267,000   of unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified as a reduction of consolidated obligation bonds in the accompanying statement of condition as of December 31, 2015. Previously, these unamortized debt issuance costs were included in other assets. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Bank's results of operations.  
  On August 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15   "Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements"   ("ASU 2015-15"). ASU 2015-15 clarifies that, given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not 
  object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and 
  subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have any impact on the Bank's results of operations or financial condition.  
  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05   "Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement"   ("ASU 2015-05"), which clarifies when fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement pertain to the acquisition of a software license, services, or both. For public business entities, the guidance in ASU 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 (January 1, 2016 for the Bank). Early adoption was permitted. The Bank could elect to adopt ASU 2015-05 either (i) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (ii) retrospectively. The Bank elected to adopt this guidance prospectively. The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on the Bank's results of operations or financial condition.

Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, "  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships"   ("ASU 2016-05"), which clarifies the hedge accounting impact when there is a change in one of the counterparties to the derivative contract (i.e., a novation). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative contract, in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a hedging relationship. An entity will, however, still need to evaluate whether it is probable that the counterparty will perform under the contract as part of its ongoing effectiveness assessment for hedge accounting. For public business entities, the guidance in ASU 2016-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (January 1, 2017 for the Bank), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to adopt ASU 2016-05 on a prospective basis to new derivative contract novations or on a modified retrospective basis. The Bank elected to adopt this guidance on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2016-05 has not had any impact on the Bank's results of operations or financial condition. 
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.   On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,   "Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments"   ("ASU 2016-06"), which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. The guidance requires entities to apply only the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call or put options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts. Consequently, when a call or put option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call or put option is related to interest rates or credit risks. For public business entities, the guidance in ASU 2016-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (January 1, 2017 for the Bank), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the period for which the amendments are effective. The Bank has not yet determined the effect, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have on its results of operations or financial condition. 
  Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"   ("ASU 2016-13"), which amends the guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments by replacing the current incurred loss methodology with an expected credit loss methodology. Among other things, ASU 2016-13 requires: 
      entities to present financial assets, or groups of financial assets, measured at amortized cost at the net amount expected to be collected, which is computed by deducting an allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s); 
      the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount; 
      the statement of income to reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases in expected credit losses that have taken place during the period; 
      entities to determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ("PCD assets") that are measured at amortized cost in a manner similar to other financial assets measured at amortized cost (the initial allowance for credit losses on PCD assets is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense); 
      credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses, the amount of which is limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost; and 
      public business entities to further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by year of origination. 
  For public business entities that are SEC filers, the guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (January 1, 2020 for the Bank), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the amendments are adopted. However, entities are required to use a prospective transition approach for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the date of adoption. The Bank has not yet determined the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its results of operations or financial condition. 
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"   ("ASU 2016-15"), which clarifies the guidance for classifying certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice regarding eight specific cash flow presentation issues. For public business entities, the guidance in ASU 2016-15 is  
  
    8 

     Table of Contents  

effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Bank), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, including adoption in an interim period, is permitted. The guidance is to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied as if the change was made prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will not have any impact on the Bank's statement of cash flows, nor will it have any impact on the Bank's results of operations or financial condition.

Note 4 Available-for-Sale Securities 
     Major Security Types.   Available-for-sale securities as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

Available-for-sale securities as of   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Included in the tables above are GSE commercial mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") that were purchased but which had not yet settled as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The aggregate amounts due of   $253,370,000   and   $164,889,000  , respectively, are included in other liabilities on the statements of condition at those dates.  
  Other debentures are comprised of securities issued by the Private Export Funding Corporation ("PEFCO"). These debentures are fully secured by U.S. government-guaranteed obligations and the payment of interest on the debentures is guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. The amortized cost of the Bank's available-for-sale securities includes hedging adjustments.

The following table summarizes (in thousands, except number of positions) the available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position. 

The following table summarizes (in thousands, except number of positions) the available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses as of   December 31, 2015  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position.   

At   September 30, 2016  , the gross unrealized losses on the Bank s available-for-sale securities were   $58,635,000  . All of the Bank's available-for-sale securities are either guaranteed by the U.S. government, issued by GSEs, or fully secured by collateral that is guaranteed by the U.S government. As of   September 30, 2016  , the U.S. government and the issuers of the Bank s holdings of GSE debentures and GSE MBS were rated triple-A by Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. ( Fitch ) and AA+ by S P Global Ratings ( S P ). The Bank's holdings of PEFCO debentures are rated triple-A by Moody's and Fitch, and are not rated by S P. Based upon the Bank's assessment of the strength of the government guaranty, the Bank expects that the U.S. government-guaranteed debentures that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   would not be settled at an amount less than the Bank's amortized cost bases in the investments. In addition, based upon the Bank's assessment of the creditworthiness of the issuers of the GSE debentures and the credit ratings assigned by each of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ( NRSROs ), the Bank expects that its holdings of GSE debentures that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   would not be settled at an amount less than the Bank's amortized cost bases in these investments. Further, based upon the Bank's assessment of the strength of the GSEs' guarantees of the Bank's holdings of GSE commercial MBS and the credit ratings assigned by each of the NRSROs, the Bank expects that its holdings of GSE commercial MBS that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   would not be settled at an amount less than the Bank s amortized cost bases in these investments. Because the current market value deficits associated with the Bank's available-for-sale securities are not attributable to credit quality, and because the Bank does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, the Bank does not consider any of these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

Interest Rate Payment Terms.   The following table provides interest rate payment terms for investment securities classified as available-for-sale at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , substantially all of the Bank's fixed-rate available-for-sale securities were swapped to a variable rate. 
  Sales of Securities.   During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank sold available-for-sale securities with an amortized cost (determined by the specific identification method) of   $200,214,000   and   $2,650,291,000  , respectively. Proceeds from the sales totaled   $201,103,000   and   $2,655,395,000  , respectively, resulting in realized gains of   $889,000   and   $5,104,000  , respectively. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank sold available-for-sale securities with an amortized cost (determined by the specific identification method) of   $199,068,000   and   $736,992,000  , respectively. Proceeds from the sales totaled   $200,525,000   and   $740,794,000  , respectively, resulting in realized gains of   $1,457,000   and   $3,802,000  , respectively.

The unrealized losses include other-than-temporary impairments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and gross unrecognized holding losses (or, in the case of the Bank's holdings of non-agency residential MBS, gross unrecognized holding gains) and are aggregated by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position.

At   September 30, 2016  , the gross unrealized losses on the Bank s held-to-maturity securities were   $12,933,000  , of which   $8,140,000   were attributable to its holdings of non-agency (i.e., private-label) residential MBS and   $4,793,000   were attributable to securities that are either guaranteed by the U.S. government or issued and guaranteed by GSEs.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the U.S. government and the issuers of the Bank s holdings of GSE MBS were rated triple-A by Moody s and Fitch and AA+ by S P. Based upon the Bank's assessment of the strength of the government guaranty, the Bank expects that the U.S. government-guaranteed debentures and its holdings of U.S. government-guaranteed MBS that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   would not be settled at an amount less than the Bank's amortized cost bases in these investments. In addition, based upon the credit ratings assigned by the NRSROs and the Bank's assessment of the strength of the GSEs  guarantees of the Bank s holdings of GSE MBS, the Bank expects that its holdings of GSE MBS that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   would not be settled at an amount less than the Bank s amortized cost bases in these investments. Because the current market value deficits associated with these securities are not attributable to credit quality, and because the Bank does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, the Bank does not consider any of these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The deterioration in the U.S. housing markets that occurred primarily during the period from 2007 through 2011, as reflected during that period by declines in the values of residential real estate and higher levels of delinquencies, defaults and  
  
    13 

     Table of Contents  

losses on residential mortgages, including the mortgages underlying the Bank s non-agency residential MBS ( RMBS ), generally increased the risk that the Bank may not ultimately recover the entire cost bases of some of its non-agency RMBS.  However, based upon its analysis of the securities in this portfolio, the Bank believes that the unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   were principally the result of liquidity risk related discounts in the non-agency RMBS market and do not accurately reflect the currently likely future credit performance of the securities. 
  Because the ultimate receipt of contractual payments on the Bank s non-agency RMBS will depend upon the credit and prepayment performance of the underlying loans and the credit enhancements for the senior securities owned by the Bank, the Bank closely monitors these investments in an effort to determine whether the credit enhancement associated with each security is sufficient to protect against potential losses of principal and interest on the underlying mortgage loans. The credit enhancement for each of the Bank s non-agency RMBS is provided by a senior/subordinate structure, and none of the securities owned by the Bank are insured by third-party bond insurers. More specifically, each of the Bank s non-agency RMBS represents a single security class within a securitization that has multiple classes of securities. Each security class has a distinct claim on the cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans, with the subordinate securities having a junior claim relative to the more senior securities. The Bank s non-agency RMBS have a senior claim on the cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans. 
  To assess whether the entire amortized cost bases of its   24   non-agency RMBS holdings are likely to be recovered, the Bank performed a cash flow analysis for each security as of   September 30, 2016   using two third-party models. The first model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the Bank s securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, to project prepayments, defaults and loss severities. A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core based statistical areas ( CBSAs ), which are based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets. (The term  CBSA  refers collectively to metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; as currently defined, a CBSA must contain at least one urban area of 10,000 or more people.) The Bank s housing price forecast as of   September 30, 2016   assumed changes in home prices ranging from declines of   1 percent   to increases of   10 percent   over the   12  -month period beginning   July 1, 2016  . For the vast majority of markets, the changes were projected to range from increases of   3 percent   to   6 percent  . Thereafter, home price changes for each market were projected to return (at varying rates and over varying transition periods based on historical housing price patterns) to their long-term historical equilibrium levels. Following these transition periods, the constant long-term annual rates of appreciation for the vast majority of markets were projected to range between   2 percent   and   5 percent  .  
  The month-by-month projections of future loan performance derived from the first model, which reflect projected prepayments, defaults and loss severities, are then input into a second model that allocates the projected loan level cash flows and losses to the various security classes in the securitization structure in accordance with its prescribed cash flow and loss allocation rules. In a securitization in which the credit enhancement for the senior securities is derived from the presence of subordinate securities, losses are generally allocated first to the subordinate securities until their principal balance is reduced to zero. 
  Based on the results of its cash flow analyses, the Bank determined it was not likely that it would fully recover the remaining amortized cost basis of   one   of its previously other-than-temporarily impaired non-agency RMBS and, accordingly, this security was deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  . The difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from this security and its amortized cost basis (i.e., the credit loss) totaled   $8,000   at   September 30, 2016  . Because the Bank does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, only the amount related to the credit loss was recognized in earnings. The credit loss associated with this security was reclassified from AOCI to earnings during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as the estimated fair value of the security was greater than its carrying value at that date. None of the Bank's other non-agency RMBS were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

For the security for which an other-than-temporary impairment was determined to have occurred as of   September 30, 2016  , the following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings (dollars in thousands): 

________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Although the other-than-temporarily impaired security was not labeled as Alt-A at the time of issuance, based upon its current collateral and performance characteristics, it was analyzed using Alt-A assumptions. 
               (2)   
    The prepayment rate reflects the weighted average of projected future voluntary prepayments. The default rate reflects the total balance of loans projected to default as a percentage of the current unpaid principal balance of the underlying loan pool. The loss severity reflects the total projected loan losses as a percentage of the total balance of loans that are projected to default. 
               (3)   
    The current credit enhancement percentage reflects the ability of subordinated classes of securities to absorb principal losses and interest shortfalls before the senior class held by the Bank is impacted (i.e., the losses, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal balances, that could be incurred in the underlying loan pool before the security held by the Bank would be impacted, assuming that all of those losses occurred on the measurement date). Depending upon the timing and amount of losses in the underlying loan pool, it is possible that the senior class held by the Bank could bear losses in scenarios where the cumulative loan losses do not exceed the current credit enhancement percentage. 
     In addition to the security that was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  ,   14   of the Bank's holdings of non-agency RMBS were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired in periods prior to 2013. The following table presents a rollforward for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   of the amount related to credit losses on the Bank s non-agency RMBS holdings for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands). 

Redemption Terms.   The amortized cost, carrying value and estimated fair value of held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented below (in thousands). The expected maturities of some debentures could differ from the contractual maturities presented because issuers may have the right to call such debentures prior to their final stated maturities.

     Table of Contents  

The amortized cost of the Bank s mortgage-backed securities classified as held-to-maturity includes net purchase discounts of   $10,262,000   and   $13,139,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
         Interest Rate Payment Terms.   The following table provides interest rate payment terms for investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

All of the Bank s variable-rate collateralized mortgage obligations classified as held-to-maturity securities have coupon rates that are subject to interest rate caps, none of which were reached during   2015   or the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Sales of Securities.   During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank sold held-to-maturity securities with an amortized cost (determined by the specific identification method) of   $14,842,000   and   $129,063,000  , respectively. Proceeds from the sales totaled   $14,907,000   and   $129,857,000  , respectively, resulting in realized gains of   $65,000   and   $794,000  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank sold held-to-maturity securities with an amortized cost (determined by the specific identification method) of   $159,952,000   and   $748,390,000  , respectively. Proceeds from these sales totaled   $163,249,000   and   $761,800,000  , respectively, resulting in realized gains of   $3,297,000   and   $13,410,000  , respectively. For each of these securities, the Bank had previously collected at least 85 percent of the principal outstanding at the time of acquisition. As such, the sales were considered maturities for purposes of security classification.

Note 6 Advances 
         Redemption Terms.   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had advances outstanding at interest rates ranging from   0.25 percent   to   8.27 percent   and from   0.21 percent   to   8.27 percent  , respectively, as summarized below (dollars in thousands). 

Amortizing advances require repayment according to predetermined amortization schedules. 
  The Bank offers advances to members that may be prepaid on specified dates without the member incurring prepayment or termination fees (prepayable and callable advances). The prepayment of other advances requires the payment of a fee to the Bank (prepayment fee) if necessary to make the Bank financially indifferent to the prepayment of the advance. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had aggregate prepayable and callable advances totaling   $12,475,424,000   and $  5,895,751,000  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by the earlier of contractual maturity or next call date, or the first date on which prepayable advances can be repaid without a prepayment fee (in thousands): 

The Bank also offers putable advances. With a putable advance, the Bank purchases a put option from the member that allows the Bank to terminate the fixed-rate advance on specified dates and offer, subject to certain conditions, replacement funding at prevailing market rates. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had putable advances outstanding totaling   $1,053,071,000   and   $1,097,071,000  , respectively.

The following table summarizes advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by the earlier of contractual maturity or next possible put date (in thousands): 

Interest Rate Payment Terms.   The following table provides interest rate payment terms for advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   27 percent   and   26 percent  , respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate advances were swapped to a variable rate. 
         Prepayment Fees.   When a member/borrower prepays an advance, the Bank could suffer lower future income if the principal portion of the prepaid advance is reinvested in lower-yielding assets. To protect against this risk, the Bank generally charges a prepayment fee that makes it financially indifferent to a borrower s decision to prepay an advance. The Bank records prepayment fees received from members/borrowers on prepaid advances net of any associated hedging adjustments on those advances. These fees are reflected as interest income in the statements of income either immediately (as prepayment fees on advances) or over time (as interest income on advances) as further described below. In cases in which the Bank funds a new advance concurrent with or within a short period of time before or after the prepayment of an existing advance and the advance meets the accounting criteria to qualify as a modification of the prepaid advance, the net prepayment fee on the prepaid advance is deferred, recorded in the basis of the modified advance, and amortized into interest income on advances over the life of the modified advance using the level-yield method. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, gross advance prepayment fees received from members/borrowers were   $4,878,000   and   $4,054,000  , respectively, of which   $172,000   and   $1,909,000  , respectively, were deferred. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, gross advance prepayment fees received from members/borrowers were   $7,613,000   and $  18,583,000  , respectively, of which   $456,000   and   $6,398,000  , respectively, were deferred.  

Note 7 Allowance for Credit Losses 
  An allowance for credit losses is separately established for each of the Bank s identified portfolio segments, if necessary, to provide for probable losses inherent in its financing receivables portfolio and other off-balance sheet credit exposures as of the balance sheet date. To the extent necessary, an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded as a liability. 
  A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The Bank has developed and documented a systematic methodology for determining an allowance for credit losses for the following portfolio segments: (1) advances and other extensions of credit to members/ 
  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

borrowers, collectively referred to as  extensions of credit to members  (2) government-guaranteed/insured mortgage loans held for portfolio; and (3) conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio. 
  Classes of financing receivables are generally a disaggregation of a portfolio segment and are determined on the basis of their initial measurement attribute, the risk characteristics of the financing receivable and an entity s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk. Because the credit risk arising from the Bank s financing receivables is assessed and measured at the portfolio segment level, the Bank does not have separate classes of financing receivables within each of its portfolio segments. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no significant purchases or sales of financing receivables, nor were any financing receivables reclassified to held for sale. 
         Advances and Other Extensions of Credit to Members.   In accordance with federal statutes, including the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (the  FHLB Act ), the Bank lends to financial institutions within its five-state district that are involved in housing finance. The FHLB Act requires the Bank to obtain and maintain sufficient collateral for advances and other extensions of credit to protect against losses. The Bank makes advances and otherwise extends credit only against eligible collateral, as defined by regulation. To ensure the value of collateral pledged to the Bank is sufficient to secure its advances and other extensions of credit, the Bank applies various haircuts, or discounts, to the collateral to determine the value against which borrowers may borrow. As additional security, the Bank has a statutory lien on each borrower s capital stock in the Bank. 
  On at least a quarterly basis, the Bank evaluates all outstanding extensions of credit to members/borrowers for potential credit losses. These evaluations include a review of: (1) the amount, type and performance of collateral available to secure the outstanding obligations; (2) metrics that may be indicative of changes in the financial condition and general creditworthiness of the member/borrower; and (3) the payment status of the obligations. Any outstanding extensions of credit that exhibit a potential credit weakness that could jeopardize the full collection of the outstanding obligations would be classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. The Bank did not have any advances or other extensions of credit to members/borrowers that were classified as substandard, doubtful or loss at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Bank considers the amount, type and performance of collateral to be the primary indicator of credit quality with respect to its extensions of credit to members/borrowers. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value in excess of each borrower s outstanding extensions of credit. 
  The Bank continues to evaluate and, as necessary, modify its credit extension and collateral policies based on market conditions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank did not have any advances that were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. There have been no troubled debt restructurings related to advances. 
  The Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance or any other extension of credit to a member/borrower and, based on its credit extension and collateral policies, management currently does not anticipate any credit losses on its extensions of credit to members/borrowers. Accordingly, the Bank has not provided any allowance for credit losses on advances, nor has it recorded any liabilities to reflect an allowance for credit losses related to its off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
     Mortgage Loans   Government-guaranteed/Insured.   The Bank s government-guaranteed/insured fixed-rate mortgage loans are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Any losses from these loans are expected to be recovered from those entities. Any losses from these loans that are not recovered from those entities are absorbed by the servicers. Therefore, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on government-guaranteed/insured mortgage loans. Government-guaranteed/insured loans are not placed on nonaccrual status. 
  Mortgage Loans   Conventional Mortgage Loans.   The Bank s conventional mortgage loans have been acquired through the Mortgage Partnership Finance         ( MPF        ) program, as more fully described in the Bank s   2015   10-K. The allowance for losses on conventional mortgage loans is determined by an analysis that includes consideration of various data such as past performance, current performance, loan portfolio characteristics, collateral-related characteristics, and prevailing economic conditions. The allowance for losses on conventional mortgage loans also factors in the credit enhancement under the MPF program. Any incurred losses that are expected to be recovered from the credit enhancements are not reserved as part of the Bank s allowance for loan losses. 
  The Bank places a conventional mortgage loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. When a mortgage loan is placed on nonaccrual status, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. The Bank records cash payments received on nonaccrual loans first as interest income until it recovers all interest, and then as a reduction of principal. A loan on nonaccrual status is restored to accrual status when none of its contractual principal and interest is due and unpaid, and the Bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual interest and principal. 
  
    19 

     Table of Contents  

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collateral-dependent loans that are on nonaccrual status are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs. Loans are considered collateral-dependent if repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying property; that is, there is no other available and reliable source of repayment. A collateral-dependent loan is impaired if the fair value of the underlying collateral is insufficient to recover the unpaid principal and interest on the loan. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized in the same manner as it is for nonaccrual loans noted above. 
  The Bank evaluates whether to record a charge-off on a conventional mortgage loan when the loan becomes 180 days or more past due or upon the occurrence of a confirming event, whichever occurs first. Confirming events include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of foreclosure or notification of a claim against any of the credit enhancements. A charge-off is recorded if the recorded investment in the loan will not be recovered. 
  The Bank considers the key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans to be the payment status of each loan. The table below summarizes the recorded investment by payment status for mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands).

     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank s other assets included   $85,000   and   $49,000  , respectively, of real estate owned. 
  Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage loan agreement. Each nonaccrual mortgage loan and each troubled debt restructuring is specifically reviewed for impairment. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated value of the collateral securing each of these loans, plus the estimated amount that can be recovered through credit enhancements and mortgage insurance, if any, exceeded the outstanding loan amount. Therefore, no specific reserve was established for any of these mortgage loans. The remaining conventional mortgage loans were evaluated for impairment on a pool basis. Based upon the current and past performance of these loans and current economic conditions, the Bank determined that an allowance for loan losses of   $141,000   was adequate to reserve for credit losses in its conventional mortgage loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  .

Note 8 Consolidated Obligations 
  Consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks and consist of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes. Consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the 11 FHLBanks. Consolidated obligations are not obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, the U.S. government. The FHLBanks issue consolidated obligations through the Office of Finance as their agent. In connection with each debt issuance, one or more of the FHLBanks specifies the amount of debt it wants issued on its behalf; the Bank receives the proceeds of only the debt issued on its behalf and records on its statements of condition only that portion of the consolidated obligations for which it has received the proceeds. Consolidated obligation bonds are issued primarily to raise intermediate- and long-term funds for the FHLBanks and are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity. Consolidated obligation discount notes are issued to raise short-term funds and have maturities of one year or less. These notes are generally issued at a price that is less than their face amount and are redeemed at par value when they mature. For additional information regarding the FHLBanks  joint and several liability on consolidated obligations, see Note 15. 
  The par amounts of the 11 FHLBanks  outstanding consolidated obligations, including consolidated obligations held as investments by other FHLBanks, were approximately   $968 billion   and   $905 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Bank was the primary obligor on   $54.2 billion   and   $38.6 billion   (at par value), respectively, of these consolidated obligations. 
        Interest Rate Payment Terms.   The following table summarizes the Bank s consolidated obligation bonds outstanding by interest rate payment terms at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands, at par value).

Note 10 Assets and Liabilities Subject to Offsetting 
  The Bank has derivatives and securities purchased under agreements to resell that are subject to enforceable master netting agreements or similar arrangements. For purposes of reporting derivative assets and derivative liabilities, the Bank offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments (including the right to reclaim cash collateral and the obligation to return cash collateral) where a legally enforceable right of setoff exists. The Bank did not have any liabilities that were eligible to offset its securities purchased under agreements to resell (i.e., securities sold under agreements to repurchase) as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Bank's derivative transactions are executed either bilaterally or, if required, cleared through a third-party central clearinghouse. The Bank has entered into master agreements with each of its bilateral derivative counterparties that provide for the netting of all transactions with each of these counterparties. Under its master agreements with its non-member bilateral derivative counterparties, collateral is delivered (or returned) daily when certain thresholds (ranging from $  100,000   to $  500,000  ) are met. The Bank offsets the fair value amounts recognized for bilaterally traded derivatives executed with the same counterparty, including any cash collateral remitted to or received from the counterparty. When entering into derivative transactions with its members, the Bank requires the member to post eligible collateral in an amount equal to the sum of the net market value of the member s derivative transactions with the Bank (if the value is positive to the Bank) plus a percentage of the notional amount of any interest rate swaps, with market values determined on at least a monthly basis. Eligible collateral for derivative transactions with members consists of collateral that is eligible to secure advances and other obligations under the member's Advances and Security Agreement with the Bank. The Bank is not required to pledge collateral to its members to secure derivative positions. For cleared derivatives, all transactions with each clearing member of each clearinghouse are netted pursuant to legally enforceable setoff rights. Cleared derivatives are subject to initial and variation margin requirements established by the clearinghouse and its clearing members. Collateral associated with cleared derivatives (i.e., initial and variation margin) is typically delivered (or returned) daily and is not subject to any maximum unsecured thresholds. The Bank offsets the fair value amounts recognized for cleared derivatives transacted with each clearing member of each clearinghouse, including cash collateral pledged or received. 
  The following table presents derivative instruments and securities purchased under agreements to resell with the legal right of offset, including the related collateral received from or pledged to counterparties as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands).

Note 11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
         Hedging Activities.   As a financial intermediary, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk. This risk arises from a variety of financial instruments that the Bank enters into on a regular basis in the normal course of its business. The Bank enters into interest rate swap, swaption, cap and forward rate agreements (collectively, interest rate exchange agreements) to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank may use these instruments to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk management objectives. In addition, the Bank may use these instruments to hedge the variable cash flows associated with forecasted transactions. The Bank has not entered into any credit default swaps or foreign exchange-related derivatives and, as of   September 30, 2016  , it was not a party to any forward rate agreements. 
  The Bank uses interest rate exchange agreements in three ways: (1) by designating the agreement as a fair value hedge of a specific financial instrument or firm commitment; (2) by designating the agreement as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction; or (3) by designating the agreement as a hedge of some other defined risk (referred to as an  economic hedge ). For example, the Bank uses interest rate exchange agreements in its overall interest rate risk management activities to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of consolidated obligations to approximate more closely the interest rate sensitivity of its assets (both advances and investments), and/or to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of advances or investments to approximate more closely the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. In addition to using interest rate exchange agreements to manage mismatches between the coupon features of its assets and liabilities, the Bank also uses interest rate exchange agreements to, among other things, manage embedded options in assets and liabilities, to preserve the market value of existing assets and liabilities, to hedge the duration risk of prepayable instruments, to hedge the variable cash flows associated with forecasted transactions, to offset interest rate exchange agreements entered into with members (the Bank serves as an intermediary in these transactions), and to reduce funding costs. 
  The Bank, consistent with Finance Agency regulations, enters into interest rate exchange agreements only to reduce potential market risk exposures inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and liabilities or anticipated transactions, or to act as an intermediary between its members and the Bank s non-member derivative counterparties. The Bank is not a derivatives dealer and it does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. 
  At inception, the Bank formally documents the relationships between derivatives designated as hedging instruments and their hedged items, its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions, and its method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging relationships. For fair value hedges, this process includes linking the derivatives to: (1) specific assets and liabilities on the statements of condition or (2) firm commitments. For cash flow hedges, this process includes linking the derivatives to forecasted transactions. The Bank also formally assesses (both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on a monthly basis thereafter) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items or the cash flows associated with forecasted transactions and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain effective in future periods. The Bank uses regression analyses to assess the effectiveness of its hedges. 
         Investments     The Bank has invested in agency and non-agency MBS. The interest rate and prepayment risk associated with these investment securities is managed through consolidated obligations and/or derivatives. The Bank may manage prepayment and duration risk presented by some investment securities with either callable or non-callable consolidated obligations or interest rate exchange agreements, including caps and interest rate swaps. 
  A substantial portion of the Bank s held-to-maturity securities are variable-rate MBS that include caps that would limit the variable-rate coupons if short-term interest rates rise dramatically. To hedge a portion of the potential cap risk embedded in these securities, the Bank has entered into interest rate cap agreements. These derivatives are treated as economic hedges. 
  Substantially all of the Bank's available-for-sale securities are fixed-rate agency and other highly rated debentures and agency commercial MBS. To hedge the interest rate risk associated with these fixed-rate investment securities, the Bank has entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate exchange agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. 
  Advances     The Bank issues both fixed-rate and variable-rate advances. When appropriate, the Bank uses interest rate exchange agreements to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of its fixed-rate advances to approximate more closely the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. With issuances of putable advances, the Bank purchases from the member a put option that enables the Bank to terminate a fixed-rate advance on specified future dates. This embedded option is clearly and closely related to the host advance contract. The Bank typically hedges a putable advance by entering into a cancelable interest rate exchange agreement where the Bank pays a fixed-rate coupon and receives a variable-rate coupon, and sells an option to cancel the swap to the swap counterparty. This type of hedge is treated as a fair value hedge. The swap counterparty can cancel the interest rate exchange agreement on the call date and the Bank can cancel the putable advance and offer, subject to certain conditions, replacement funding at prevailing market rates.

A small portion of the Bank s variable-rate advances are subject to interest rate caps that would limit the variable-rate coupons if short-term interest rates rise above a predetermined level. To hedge the cap risk embedded in these advances, the Bank generally enters into interest rate cap agreements. This type of hedge is treated as a fair value hedge. 
  The Bank may hedge a firm commitment for a forward-starting advance through the use of an interest rate swap. In this case, the swap will function as the hedging instrument for both the firm commitment and the subsequent advance. The carrying value of the firm commitment will be included in the basis of the advance at the time the commitment is terminated and the advance is issued. The basis adjustment will then be amortized into interest income over the life of the advance. 
  The Bank enters into optional advance commitments with its members. In an optional advance commitment, the Bank sells an option to the member that provides the member with either the right to enter into an advance (a stand-alone option) or increase the amount of an existing advance (an embedded option) at a specified fixed rate and term on a specified future date, provided the member has satisfied all of the customary requirements for such advance. Optional advance commitments involving Community Investment Program and Economic Development Program advances with a commitment period of three months or less are currently provided at no cost to members. The Bank may hedge an optional advance commitment through the use of an interest rate swaption. In this case, the swaption will function as the hedging instrument for both the commitment and, if the option is exercised by the member, the subsequent advance. These swaptions are treated as either economic hedges (in the case of stand-alone options) or fair value hedges (in the case of embedded options). 
         Consolidated Obligations         While consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks, each FHLBank is the primary obligor for the consolidated obligations it has issued or assumed from another FHLBank. The Bank generally enters into derivative contracts to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its specific debt issuances. 
  To manage the interest rate risk of certain of its consolidated obligations, the Bank will match the cash outflow on a consolidated obligation with the cash inflow of an interest rate exchange agreement. With issuances of fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds, the Bank typically enters into a matching interest rate exchange agreement in which the counterparty pays fixed cash flows to the Bank that are designed to mirror in timing and amount the cash outflows the Bank pays on the consolidated obligation. In this transaction, the Bank pays a variable cash flow that closely matches the interest payments it receives on short-term or variable-rate assets, typically one-month or three-month LIBOR. These transactions are treated as fair value hedges. On occasion, the Bank may enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate exchange agreements to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain of its consolidated obligation discount notes. The derivatives associated with the Bank s fair value discount note hedging are treated as economic hedges. The Bank may also use interest rate exchange agreements to convert variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds from one index rate (e.g., the daily effective federal funds rate) to another index rate (e.g., one-month or three-month LIBOR). These transactions are treated as economic hedges. 
  The Bank has not issued consolidated obligations denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 
  Forecasted Issuances of Consolidated Obligations          The Bank uses derivatives to hedge the variability of cash flows over a specified period of time as a result of the forecasted issuances and maturities of short-term, fixed-rate instruments, such as three-month consolidated obligation discount notes. Although each short-term consolidated obligation discount note has a fixed rate of interest, a portfolio of rolling consolidated obligation discount notes effectively has a variable interest rate. The variable cash flows associated with these liabilities are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps. The maturity dates of the cash flow streams are closely matched to the interest rate reset dates of the derivatives. These derivatives are treated as cash flow hedges.  
         Intermediation     The Bank offers interest rate swaps, caps and floors to its members to assist them in meeting their hedging needs. In these transactions, the Bank acts as an intermediary for its members by entering into an interest rate exchange agreement with a member and then entering into an offsetting interest rate exchange agreement with one of the Bank s approved derivative counterparties. All interest rate exchange agreements related to the Bank s intermediary activities with its members are accounted for as economic hedges. 
  Other     From time to time, the Bank may enter into derivatives to hedge risks to its earnings that are not directly linked to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions. These derivatives are treated as economic hedges. 
         Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities.   The Bank accounts for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance in Topic 815 of the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) entitled    Derivatives and Hedging    ( ASC 815 ). All derivatives are recognized on the statements of condition at their fair values, including accrued interest receivable and payable. For purposes of reporting derivative assets and derivative liabilities, the Bank offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments (including the right to reclaim cash collateral and the obligation to return cash collateral) where a legally enforceable right of setoff exists. 
  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is effective as   and that is designated and qualifies as   a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk (including changes that reflect gains or losses on firm commitments), are recorded in current period earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness (which  
  
    26 

     Table of Contents  

represents the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differs from the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk) is recorded in other income (loss) as  net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.  Net interest income/expense associated with derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting under ASC 815 is recorded as a component of net interest income.  
  If fair value hedging relationships meet certain criteria specified in ASC 815, they are eligible for hedge accounting and the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items may be recorded in earnings. The application of hedge accounting generally requires the Bank to evaluate the effectiveness of the fair value hedging relationships on an ongoing basis and to calculate the changes in fair value of the derivatives and related hedged items independently. This is commonly known as the  long-haul  method of hedge accounting. Transactions that meet more stringent criteria qualify for the  shortcut  method of hedge accounting in which an assumption can be made that the change in fair value of a hedged item exactly offsets the change in value of the related derivative. The Bank considers hedges of committed advances to be eligible for the shortcut method of accounting as long as the settlement of the committed advance occurs within the shortest period possible for that type of instrument based on market settlement conventions, the fair value of the swap is zero at the inception of the hedging relationship, and the transaction meets all of the other criteria for shortcut accounting specified in ASC 815. The Bank has defined the market settlement convention to be five business days or less for advances.  
  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in AOCI until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction. Any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge (which represents the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differs from the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative having terms that match identically the critical terms of the hedged forecasted transaction) is recognized in other income (loss) as  net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.  
  An economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or non-specific assets or liabilities that does not qualify or was not designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under the Bank s Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy. These hedging strategies also comply with Finance Agency regulatory requirements prohibiting speculative derivative transactions. An economic hedge by definition introduces the potential for earnings variability as changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as an economic hedge are recorded in current period earnings with no offsetting fair value adjustment to an asset or liability. Both the net interest income/expense and the fair value changes associated with derivatives in economic hedging relationships are recorded in other income (loss) as  net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.   
  The Bank records the changes in fair value of all derivatives (and, in the case of fair value hedges, the hedged item) beginning on the trade date. 
  Cash flows associated with all derivatives are reported as cash flows from operating activities in the statements of cash flows, unless the derivative contains an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case its cash flows are reported as cash flows from financing activities. 
  The Bank may issue debt, make advances, or purchase financial instruments in which a derivative instrument is  embedded  and the financial instrument that embodies the embedded derivative instrument is not remeasured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur. Upon execution of these transactions, the Bank assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host contract) and whether a separate, non-embedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as either (1) a hedging instrument in a fair value hedge or (2) a stand-alone derivative instrument pursuant to an economic hedge. However, if the entire contract were to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, or if the Bank could not reliably identify and measure the embedded derivative for purposes of separating that derivative from its host contract, the entire contract would be carried on the statement of condition at fair value and no portion of the contract would be separately accounted for as a derivative. 
  The Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) management determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (2) the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within the originally specified time frame; (4) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or (5) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument in accordance with ASC 815 is no longer appropriate. 
  In all cases in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Bank will carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition, recognizing any additional changes in the fair value of the derivative in current period earnings.  
  
    27 

     Table of Contents  

When fair value hedge accounting for a specific derivative is discontinued due to the Bank s determination that such derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment or because the derivative is terminated, the Bank will cease to adjust the hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value and amortize the cumulative basis adjustment on the formerly hedged item into earnings over its remaining term using the level-yield method.  
  When hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, the Bank continues to carry the derivative on the statement of condition at its fair value, removing from the statement of condition any asset or liability that was recorded to recognize the firm commitment and recording it as a gain or loss in current period earnings. 
  When cash flow hedge accounting for a specific derivative is discontinued due to the Bank's determination that such derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment or because the derivative is terminated, the Bank will reclassify the cumulative fair value gains or losses recorded in AOCI as of the discontinuance date from AOCI into earnings when earnings are affected by the original forecasted transaction, except in cases where the cash flow hedge is discontinued because the forecasted transaction is no longer probable (i.e., the forecasted transaction will not occur in the originally expected period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter). In such cases, any fair value gains or losses recorded in AOCI as of the determination date are immediately reclassified to earnings as a component of "net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities." Similarly, if the Bank expects at any time that continued reporting of a net loss in AOCI would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the hedging instrument and hedged transaction in one or more future periods, the amount that is not expected to be recovered is immediately reclassified to earnings as a component of "net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities."

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no amounts reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the original forecasted transactions occurred by the end of the originally specified time periods or within two-month periods thereafter. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $3,368,000   of deferred net losses on derivative instruments in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum length of time over which the Bank is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is   10   years. 
    
  Credit Risk Related to Derivatives.   The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative agreements. The Bank manages derivative counterparty credit risk through the use of master netting agreements or other similar collateral exchange arrangements, credit analysis, and adherence to the requirements set forth in the Bank s Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy, Enterprise Credit Risk Management Policy, and Finance Agency regulations. The Bank has transacted some of its interest rate exchange agreements bilaterally with large financial institutions under master netting agreements (as of   September 30, 2016  , the notional balance of outstanding transactions with non-member bilateral counterparties and member counterparties totaled   $10.3 billion   and   $0.2 billion  , respectively). Some of these institutions (or their affiliates) buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations. The remainder of the Bank's interest rate exchange agreements have been cleared through third-party central clearinghouses (as of   September 30, 2016  , the notional balance of cleared transactions outstanding totaled   $26.9 billion  ). With cleared transactions, the Bank is exposed to credit risk in the event that the clearinghouse or the clearing member fails to meet its obligations to the Bank.  
  The notional amount of the Bank's interest rate exchange agreements does not reflect its credit risk exposure, which is much less than the notional amount. The Bank's net credit risk exposure is based on the current estimated cost, on a present value basis, of replacing at current market rates all interest rate exchange agreements with individual counterparties, if those counterparties were to default, after taking into account the value of any cash and/or securities collateral held or remitted by the Bank. For counterparties with which the Bank is in a net gain position, the Bank has credit exposure when the collateral it is holding (if any) has a value less than the amount of the gain. For counterparties with which the Bank is in a net loss position, the Bank has credit exposure when it has delivered collateral with a value greater than the amount of the loss position. The net exposure on derivative agreements is presented in Note 10. Based on the netting provisions and collateral requirements associated with its derivative agreements and the creditworthiness of its derivative counterparties, Bank management does not currently anticipate any credit losses on its derivative agreements.

Note 12 Capital 
  At all times during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory capital requirements. The following table summarizes the Bank s compliance with those capital requirements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Members are required to maintain an investment in Class B Capital Stock equal to the sum of a membership investment requirement and an activity-based investment requirement. The membership investment requirement is currently   0.04 percent   of each member s total assets as of December 31,   2015  , subject to a minimum of   $1,000   and a maximum of   $7,000,000  . The activity-based investment requirement is currently   4.1 percent   of outstanding advances, except as described below.  
  On September 21, 2015, the Bank announced a Board-authorized reduction in the activity-based stock investment 
  requirement from   4.1 percent   to   2.0 percent   for certain advances that were funded during the period from October 21, 2015 
  through December 31, 2015. To be eligible for the reduced activity-based investment requirement, advances funded during this 
  period had to have a minimum maturity of one year or greater, among other things. The standard activity-based stock investment requirement of   4.1 percent   continued to apply to all other advances that were funded during the period from October 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. 
  The Bank generally repurchases surplus stock quarterly. For the repurchases that occurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , surplus stock was defined as the amount of stock held by a shareholder in excess of   125 percent   of the shareholder s minimum investment requirement. For those repurchases, which occurred on   February 25, 2016  ,   June 27, 2016   and   September 27, 2016  , a shareholder's surplus stock was not repurchased if: (1) the amount of that shareholder's surplus stock was   $2,500,000   or less, (2) the shareholder elected to opt-out of the repurchase, or (3) the shareholder was on restricted collateral status (subject to certain exceptions). On    February 25, 2016  ,   June 27, 2016   and   September 27, 2016  , the Bank repurchased surplus stock totaling   $103,707,000  ,   $60,999,000  , and   $47,783,000  , respectively, none of which was classified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock at those dates. From time to time, the Bank may modify the definition of surplus stock or the timing and/or frequency of surplus stock repurchases. 

Note 13 Employee Retirement Plans 
  The Bank sponsors a retirement benefits program that includes health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. Components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) related to this program for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Note 14 Estimated Fair Values 
  Fair value is defined under U.S. GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U.S.  
  
    32 

     Table of Contents  

GAAP also requires an entity to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which each measurement is classified. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
         Level 1 Inputs     Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. 
         Level 2 Inputs     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or in which little information is released publicly; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data (e.g., implied spreads). 
         Level 3 Inputs     Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity. None of the Bank s assets or liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were measured using significant Level 3 inputs. 
  For financial instruments carried at fair value, the Bank reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. Reclassifications, if any, would be reported as transfers as of the beginning of the quarter in which the changes occurred. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank did not reclassify any fair value measurements.  
  The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Bank using available market information and the Bank s best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. These estimates are based on pertinent information available to the Bank as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Although the Bank uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique or valuation methodology. For example, because an active secondary market does not exist for many of the Bank s financial instruments (e.g., advances, non-agency RMBS and mortgage loans held for portfolio), in certain cases their fair values are not subject to precise quantification or verification. Therefore, the estimated fair values presented below in the Fair Value Summary Tables may not be indicative of the amounts that would have been realized in market transactions at the reporting dates. Further, the fair values do not represent an estimate of the overall market value of the Bank as a going concern, which would take into account future business opportunities. 
  The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Bank s financial instruments are described below. 
         Cash and due from banks.   The estimated fair value equals the carrying value. 
         Interest-bearing deposit assets.   Interest-bearing deposit assets earn interest at floating market rates; therefore, the estimated fair value of the deposits approximates their carrying value. 
         Securities purchased under agreements to resell and federal funds sold.   All federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell represent overnight balances. The estimated fair values approximate the carrying values. 
         Trading, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.   To value its holdings of U.S. Treasury Notes classified as trading securities, all of its available-for-sale securities, and its held-to-maturity MBS holdings and state housing agency debentures, the Bank obtains prices from three designated third-party pricing vendors when available.  
  The pricing vendors use various proprietary models to price these securities. The inputs to those models are derived from various sources including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, dealer estimates, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. Because many securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing vendors use available information as applicable such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to determine the prices for individual securities. Each pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates resolution of potentially erroneous prices identified by the Bank.  
  A "median" price is first established for each security using a formula that is based upon the number of prices received. If three prices are received, the middle price is the median price; if two prices are received, the average of the two prices is the median price; and if one price is received, it is the median price (and also the final price) subject to some type of validation similar to the evaluation of outliers described below. All prices that are within a specified tolerance threshold of the median price are included in the  cluster  of prices that are averaged to compute a  default  price. All prices that are outside the threshold ( outliers ) are subject to further analysis (including, but not limited to, comparison to prices provided by an additional third-party valuation service, prices for similar securities, and/or non-binding dealer estimates) to determine if an outlier is a better estimate of fair value. If an outlier (or some other price identified in the analysis) is determined to be a better estimate of fair value, then the outlier (or the other price, as appropriate) is used as the final price rather than the default price. If, on the other hand, the analysis confirms that an outlier (or outliers) is (are) in fact not representative of fair value and the  
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  

default price is the best estimate, then the default price is used as the final price. In all cases, the final price is used to determine the fair value of the security. 
  If all prices received for a security are outside the tolerance threshold level of the median price, then there is no default price, and the final price is determined by an evaluation of all outlier prices as described above. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , three vendor prices were received for substantially all of the Bank s trading, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities referred to above and the final prices for substantially all of those securities were computed by averaging the three prices. Based on the Bank's understanding of the pricing methods employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices (or, in those instances in which there were outliers, the Bank's additional analyses), the Bank believes its final prices result in reasonable estimates of the fair values and that the fair value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The Bank estimates the fair values of its held-to-maturity government-guaranteed debentures using a pricing model and observable market data (i.e., the U.S. Government Agency Fair Value curve and, for debentures containing call features, swaption volatility). 
  To value its mutual fund investments classified as trading securities, the Bank obtains quoted prices for identical securities. 
         Advances.   The Bank determines the estimated fair values of advances by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the advances using the replacement advance rates for advances with similar terms and, for advances containing options, swaption volatility. This amount is then reduced for accrued interest receivable. Each FHLBank prices advances at a spread to its cost of funds. Each FHLBank's cost of funds approximates the "CO curve," which is derived by adding to the U.S. Treasury curve indicative spreads obtained from market-observable sources. The indicative spreads are generally derived from dealer pricing indications, recent trades, secondary market activity and historical pricing relationships. 
         Mortgage loans held for portfolio.   The Bank estimates the fair values of mortgage loans held for portfolio based upon the prices for to-be-announced ("TBA") securities, which represent quoted market prices for forward-settling agency MBS. The prices are adjusted for differences in coupon, cost to carry, vintage, remittance type and product type between the Bank's mortgage loans and the referenced TBA MBS. The prices of the referenced TBA MBS and the Bank's mortgage loans are highly dependent upon current mortgage rates and the market's expectations of future mortgage rates and prepayments. 
         Accrued interest receivable and payable.   The estimated fair value of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates the carrying value due to their short-term nature. 
         Derivative assets/liabilities  . The fair values of the Bank s interest rate swap and swaption agreements are estimated using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market (e.g., the relevant interest rate curves (that is, the relevant LIBOR swap curve and, for purposes of discounting, the overnight index swap ("OIS") curve) and, for agreements containing options, swaption volatility). The fair values of the Bank s interest rate caps are also estimated using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market (that is, cap volatility, the relevant LIBOR swap curve and, for purposes of discounting, the OIS curve).  
  As the collateral and netting provisions of the Bank s arrangements with its derivative counterparties significantly reduce the risk from nonperformance (see Note 10), the Bank does not consider its own nonperformance risk or the nonperformance risk associated with each of its counterparties to be a significant factor in the valuation of its derivative assets and liabilities. The Bank compares the fair values obtained from its pricing model to non-binding dealer estimates (in the case of bilateral derivatives) and clearinghouse valuations (in the case of cleared derivatives) and may also compare its fair values to those of similar instruments to ensure that the fair values are reasonable.  
  The fair values of the Bank s derivative assets and liabilities include accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral remitted to/received from counterparties; the estimated fair values of the accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of the Bank's bilateral derivatives are netted by counterparty pursuant to the provisions of the credit support annexes to the Bank s master netting agreements with its non-member bilateral derivative counterparties. The Bank's cleared derivative transactions with each clearing member of each clearinghouse are netted pursuant to the Bank's arrangements with those parties. In each case, if the netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset and, if negative, as a liability. 
         Deposit liabilities.   The Bank determines the estimated fair values of its deposit liabilities with fixed rates and more than three months to maturity by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the deposits and reducing this amount for accrued interest payable. The discount rates used in these calculations are based on replacement funding rates for liabilities with similar terms. The estimated fair value approximates the carrying value for deposits with variable rates and fixed rates with three months or less to their maturity or repricing date. 
         Consolidated obligations.   The Bank estimates the fair values of consolidated obligations by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates that are based on replacement funding rates for liabilities with similar terms and

reducing this amount for accrued interest payable. The inputs to the valuation are the CO curve and, for consolidated obligations containing options, swaption volatility. 
         Mandatorily redeemable capital stock.   The fair value of capital stock subject to mandatory redemption is generally equal to its par value ($100 per share), as adjusted for any estimated dividend earned but unpaid at the time of reclassification from equity to liabilities. The Bank s capital stock cannot, by statute or implementing regulation, be purchased, redeemed, repurchased or transferred at any amount other than its par value. 
         Commitments.   The estimated fair value of the Bank s commitments to extend credit, including advances and letters of credit, was not material at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of the Bank s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands), as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified.

     The Bank did not record any non-credit other-than-temporary impairment losses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   or June 30, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Bank recorded non-credit other-than-temporary impairment losses on one of its non-agency RMBS classified as held-to-maturity. Based on the lack of significant market activity for non-agency RMBS, the nonrecurring fair value measurement for this impaired security was classified as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. Three third-party vendor prices were received for this security and the average of the three prices was used to determine the final fair value measurement.

Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies 
  Joint and several liability.   The Bank is jointly and severally liable with the other 10 FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all of the consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBanks. At   September 30, 2016  , the par amount of the other 10 FHLBanks  outstanding consolidated obligations was approximately   $913 billion  . The Finance Agency, in its discretion, may require any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, regardless of whether there has been a default by a FHLBank having primary liability. To the extent that a FHLBank makes any consolidated obligation payment on behalf of another FHLBank, the paying FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the FHLBank with primary liability. However, if the Finance Agency determines that the primary obligor is unable to satisfy its obligations, then the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liability among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding, or on any other basis that the Finance Agency may determine. No FHLBank has ever failed to make any payment on a consolidated obligation for which it was the primary obligor; as a result, the regulatory provisions for directing other FHLBanks to make payments on behalf of another FHLBank or allocating the liability among other FHLBanks have never been invoked. If the Bank expected that it would be required to pay any amounts on behalf of its co-obligors under its joint and several liability, the Bank would charge to income the amount of the expected payment. Based upon the creditworthiness of the other FHLBanks, the Bank currently believes that the likelihood that it would have to pay any amounts beyond those for which it is primarily liable is remote. 
  Other commitments and contingencies.   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had commitments to make additional advances totaling approximately   $19,722,000   and   $36,892,000  , respectively. In addition, outstanding standby letters of credit totaled   $9,590,809,000   and   $7,180,763,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Based on management s credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have any provision for credit losses on these letters of credit (see Note 7). 
   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had commitments to issue   $118,465,000   and   $90,000,000  , respectively, of consolidated obligation bonds, of which   $108,465,000   and   $90,000,000  , respectively, were hedged with interest rate swaps. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had commitments to issue   $284,406,000   and   $750,000,000  , respectively, of consolidated obligation discount notes, none of which were hedged. 
  The Bank has transacted interest rate exchange agreements with large financial institutions and third-party clearinghouses that are subject to collateral exchange arrangements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had pledged cash collateral of   $1,005,910,000   and   $523,871,000  , respectively, to those parties that had credit risk exposure to the Bank related to interest rate exchange agreements. The pledged cash collateral (i.e., interest-bearing deposit asset) is netted against derivative assets and liabilities in the statements of condition. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had pledged securities with carrying values (and fair values) of   $640,563,000   and   $300,184,000  , respectively, to parties that had credit risk exposure to the Bank related to interest rate exchange agreements. The pledged securities may be rehypothecated and are not netted against derivative assets and liabilities in the statements of condition.  
  In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank is subject to the risk that litigation may arise. Currently, the Bank is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. 

Note 16  Transactions with Shareholders 
  Affiliates of two of the Bank s derivative counterparties (Citigroup and Wells Fargo) acquired member institutions on March 31, 2005 and October 1, 2006, respectively. Since the acquisitions were completed, the Bank has continued to enter into interest rate exchange agreements with Citigroup and Wells Fargo in the normal course of business and under the same terms and conditions as before. Effective October 1, 2006, Citigroup terminated the Ninth District charter of the affiliate that acquired the member institution and, as a result, an affiliate of Citigroup became a non-member shareholder of the Bank.

Risks and uncertainties related to competitive business forces include, but are not limited to, the potential loss of a significant amount of member borrowings through acquisitions or other means or changes in the relative competitiveness of the Bank s products and services for member institutions. For a more detailed discussion of the risk factors applicable to the Bank, see  Item 1A   Risk Factors  in the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on   March 22, 2016   (the    2015   10-K ). The Bank undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances, or any other reason. 
   
  Overview 
  Business 
  The Bank is one of 11 district Federal Home Loan Banks (each individually a  FHLBank  and collectively the  FHLBanks  and, together with the Federal Home Loan Banks Office of Finance ("Office of Finance"), a joint office of the FHLBanks, the  FHLBank System ) that were created by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. The FHLBanks serve the public by enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages, community lending and targeted community development. As independent, member-owned cooperatives, the FHLBanks seek to maintain a balance between their public purpose and their ability to provide adequate returns on the capital supplied by their members. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( Finance Agency ), an independent agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government, is responsible for supervising and regulating the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The Finance Agency s stated mission is to ensure that the housing GSEs, including the FHLBanks, operate in a safe and sound manner so that they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. Consistent with this mission, the Finance Agency establishes policies and regulations covering the operations of the FHLBanks. 
  The Bank serves eligible financial institutions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas (collectively, the Ninth District of the FHLBank System). The Bank s primary business is lending relatively low cost funds (known as advances) to its member institutions, which include commercial banks, thrifts, insurance companies, credit unions, and Community Development Financial Institutions that are certified under the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994. While not members of the Bank, housing associates, including state and local housing authorities, that meet certain statutory criteria may also borrow from the Bank. The Bank also maintains a portfolio of investments, substantially all of which are highly rated, for liquidity purposes and to provide additional earnings. Additionally, the Bank holds interests in a small portfolio of government-guaranteed/insured and conventional mortgage loans, the majority of which were acquired during the period from 1998 to mid-2003 through the Mortgage Partnership Finance        ( MPF        ) Program offered by the FHLBank of Chicago. In 2016, the Bank resumed acquiring conventional mortgage loans through the MPF Program; during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , $25.6 million of mortgage loans were acquired. Shareholders  return on their investment includes dividends (which are typically paid quarterly in the form of capital stock) and the value derived from access to the Bank s products and services. Historically, the Bank has balanced the financial rewards to shareholders by seeking to pay a dividend that meets or exceeds the return on alternative short-term money market investments available to  
  
    41 

     Table of Contents  

shareholders, while lending funds at the lowest rates expected to be compatible with that objective and its objective to build retained earnings over time. 
  The Bank s capital stock is not publicly traded and can be held only by members of the Bank, by non-member institutions that acquire stock by virtue of acquiring member institutions, by a federal or state agency or insurer acting as a receiver of a closed institution, or by former members of the Bank that retain capital stock to support advances or other obligations that remain outstanding or until any applicable stock redemption or withdrawal notice period expires. All members must hold stock in the Bank. The Bank s capital stock has a par value of $100 per share and is purchased, redeemed, repurchased and transferred only at its par value. By regulation, the parties to a transaction involving the Bank's stock can include only the Bank and its member institutions (or non-member institutions or former members, as described above). While a member could transfer stock to another member of the Bank, that transfer could occur only upon approval of the Bank and then only at par value. Members may redeem excess stock, or withdraw from membership and redeem all outstanding capital stock, with five years  written notice to the Bank. 
  The FHLBanks  debt instruments (known as consolidated obligations) are their primary source of funds and are the joint and several obligations of all 11 FHLBanks. Consolidated obligations are issued through the Office of Finance (acting as agent for the FHLBanks) and generally are publicly traded in the over-the-counter market. The Bank records on its statements of condition only those consolidated obligations for which it receives the proceeds. Consolidated obligations are not obligations of the U.S. government and the U.S. government does not guarantee them. Consolidated obligations are currently rated Aaa/P-1 by Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ) and AA+/A-1+ by S P Global Ratings ( S P ). These ratings indicate that each of these nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs") has concluded that the FHLBanks have a very strong capacity to meet their commitments to pay principal and interest on consolidated obligations. The ratings also reflect the FHLBank System s status as a GSE. Historically, the FHLBanks  GSE status and very high credit ratings on consolidated obligations have provided the FHLBanks with excellent capital markets access. Deposits, other borrowings and the proceeds from capital stock issued to members are also sources of funds for the Bank. 
  In addition to ratings on the FHLBanks  consolidated obligations, each FHLBank is rated individually by both S P and Moody s. These individual FHLBank ratings apply to the individual obligations of the respective FHLBanks, such as interest rate derivatives, deposits and letters of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , Moody s had assigned a deposit rating of Aaa/P-1 to each of the FHLBanks and S P had rated each of the FHLBanks AA+/A-1+.  
  Shareholders, bondholders and prospective shareholders and bondholders should understand that these credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities and they may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the NRSRO. The ratings from each of the NRSROs should be evaluated independently. 
  The Bank conducts its business and fulfills its public purpose primarily by acting as a financial intermediary between its members and the capital markets. The intermediation of the timing, structure and amount of its members  credit needs with the investment requirements of the Bank s creditors is made possible by the extensive use of interest rate exchange agreements, including interest rate swaps, swaptions and caps. The Bank s interest rate exchange agreements are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification entitled    Derivatives and Hedging.  
  The Bank s profitability objective is to generate sufficient earnings to allow the Bank to continue to increase its retained earnings and pay dividends on capital stock at rates that meet the Bank's dividend targets. The Bank's target for quarterly dividends on Class B-1 Stock is an annualized rate that approximates the average one-month LIBOR rate for the immediately preceding quarter, with the expectation that dividend rates on Class B-1 Stock will not be lower than an annualized rate of 0.375 percent (the rate paid on previously outstanding Class B shares during the period from 2010 through 2015). The target range for quarterly dividends on Class B-2 Stock is an annualized rate that approximates the average one-month LIBOR rate for the preceding quarter plus 0.5 - 1.0 percent. While the Bank has had a long-standing practice of paying quarterly dividends, future dividend payments cannot be assured. 
  The Bank operates in only one reportable segment. All of the Bank s revenues are derived from U.S. operations.

    The figures shown reflect the number of institutions that were Community Financial Institutions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   based upon the definitions of Community Financial Institutions that applied as of those dates. 
     For   2016  , Community Financial Institutions ( CFIs ) are defined to include all institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) with average total assets as of December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   of less than   $1.128 billion  . For   2015  , CFIs were defined as FDIC-insured institutions with average total assets as of December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   of less than   $1.123 billion  . 
  Financial Market Conditions  
  Economic growth in the United States expanded moderately during the   third   quarter of   2016  . The gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent during the   third   quarter of   2016  , after increasing at an annual rate of 1.4 percent during the second quarter of   2016  , 0.8 percent during the first quarter of   2016   and 2.6 percent during 2015. The nationwide unemployment rate was 5.0 percent at   September 30, 2016  , up slightly from 4.9 percent at June 30, 2016 and the same as the rates at both March 31, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  . Housing prices continued to improve in most major metropolitan areas.  
  The Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") maintained its target for the federal funds rate at a range between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent throughout the first   nine   months of   2016  . At its November 2016 meeting, the FOMC stated that it expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. 
  One-month and three-month LIBOR increased during the first   nine   months of   2016  , with one-month and three-month LIBOR ending the   third   quarter at   0.53 percent   and   0.85 percent  , respectively, as compared to   0.43 percent   and   0.61 percent  , respectively, at the end of   2015  .

     Year-to-Date 2016 Summary 
             
    The Bank ended the   third   quarter of   2016   with total assets of   $58.4 billion   compared with   $42.1 billion   at the end of   2015  . The $16.3 billion increase in total assets during the   nine  -month period was attributable primarily to increases in the Bank's advances ($7.1 billion), short-term liquidity portfolio ($6.1 billion) and long-term investments ($3.0 billion).   
                 
    The Bank s net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $21.1 million   and   $50.6 million  , respectively, as compared to   $5.6 million   and   $52.5 million  , respectively, during the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase of $15.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in 2015 was due primarily to a $16.3 million increase in net interest income and an $11.0 million favorable change in gains and losses on derivatives and hedging activities (most of which are expected to be transitory in nature), offset by a $4.7 million increase in other expenses, a $3.8 million decrease in realized gains on the sales of long-term investment securities, a $2.0 million unfavorable change in gains and losses on trading securities and a $1.7 million increase in Affordable Housing Program expenses. The decrease of $1.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in 2015 was due primarily to a $22.4 million unfavorable change in gains and losses on derivatives and hedging activities (most of which are expected to be transitory in nature), an $11.3 million decrease in realized gains on the sales of long-term investment securities and a $6.8 million increase in other expenses, offset by a $29.4 million increase in net interest income, a $7.6 million increase in gains on trading securities and a $1.1 million increase in letter of credit fees. For additional discussion, see the section entitled "Results of Operations" beginning on page 62 of this report. 
                 
    During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Bank paid dividends totaling   $12.2 million  . The Bank s first quarter 2016 dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.375 percent (as average one-month LIBOR for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.251 percent) and 1.251 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the fourth quarter of 2015 plus 1.0 percent), respectively. The Bank s second quarter 2016 dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.431 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the first quarter of 2016) and 1.431 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the first quarter of 2016 plus 1.0 percent), respectively. The Bank s third quarter 2016 dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.444 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the second

Regulatory Developments  
  Joint Proposed Rule on Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements 
  On April 26, 2016, the Finance Agency, jointly with five other federal regulators, published a proposed rule in response to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), which requires implementation of regulations or guidelines to: (1) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions and (2) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator. 
  The proposed rule identifies three categories of institutions that would be covered by these regulations based on average total consolidated assets, applying less prescriptive incentive-based compensation program requirements to the smallest covered institutions (Level 3) and progressively more rigorous requirements to the larger covered institutions (Level 1). Under the proposed rule, the Bank would fall into the middle category (Level 2). The proposed rule would supplement existing Finance Agency executive compensation rules. 
  The proposed rule would prohibit the Bank from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by  senior executive officers  and  significant risk-takers  (each as defined in the proposed rule, and together,  covered persons ) that could lead to a material financial loss at the Bank.  
  If adopted in its current form, the proposed rule would, among other things, impose requirements relating to the Bank s incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons, including the following: 
             
    mandatory deferrals of 50 percent and 40 percent of annual and long-term incentive-based compensation payments for senior executive officers and significant risk takers, respectively, over no less than three years for annual incentive-based compensation and one year for compensation awarded under a long-term incentive plan; 
                
    risk of downward adjustment and forfeiture of awards; 
                
    clawbacks of vested compensation; and  
                
    limits on the maximum incentive-based compensation opportunities. 
     Comments on the proposed rule were due by July 22, 2016.  
  Joint Proposed Rule Regarding Net Stable Funding Ratio     
  On May 3, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), the Department of Treasury and the FDIC jointly issued a proposed rule that would implement a stable funding requirement for large and internationally active banking organizations. The net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") would require institutions to maintain liquidity to match their assets over a one-year time horizon. The FRB is proposing a modified NSFR requirement for bank holding companies and certain savings and loan holding companies that, in each case, have more than $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. If adopted in its current form, the proposed rule would provide that secured funding  
  
    46 

     Table of Contents  

with maturities between six months and one year, including FHLBank advances, would be assigned 50 percent liquidity credit for purposes of calculating compliance with the NSFR, which could affect demand for the Bank s advances. 
  Comments on the proposed rule were due by August 5, 2016.   
  Final Rule Establishing Margin Requirements for the TBA Market     
  On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a rule that was proposed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) which will require the margining of certain  to-be-announced  ( TBA ) transactions. Specifically, FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customer s maintenance margin (i.e., initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are  Covered Agency Transactions,  subject to certain exemptions. A  Covered Agency Transaction  includes: 
             
    TBA transactions inclusive of ARM transactions and Specified Pool Transactions (each as defined by FINRA rules) for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than one business day; and 
                
    Collateralized mortgage obligations issued in conformity with a program of an agency or a GSE for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than three business days. 
     Covered Agency Transactions with a counterparty in multifamily housing securities are exempt from the margin requirements provided that certain requirements are met. 
  Under the rule, the Bank is exempt from posting initial margin but would be required to post variation margin to its FINRA-member counterparty in connection with any Covered Agency Transactions, provided the Bank has more than $10 million in gross open positions with the counterparty.   
  FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017.  
  Proposed Rule on Indemnification Payments    
  On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by a FHLBank to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments would only be permitted if they relate to: 
             
    premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016. 
     The proposed rule also outlines the process that a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
  Comments on the proposed rule are due by December 21, 2016.   

Financial Condition 
  The following table provides selected period-end balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as selected average balances for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . As shown in the table, the Bank s total assets increased by   38.7   percent between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , due primarily to increases in the Bank's advances, short-term liquidity portfolio and long-term investments of $7.1 billion, $6.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. As the Bank s assets increased, the funding for those assets also increased. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total consolidated obligations increased by $  15.7 billion   as consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes increased by   $5.1 billion   and   $10.6 billion  , respectively.

Advances 
  The Bank's advances balances (at par value) increased by   $7.1 billion   (28.6 percent) during the first   nine   months of   2016  . The increase in the Bank's advances was due largely to increased demand for loans from its larger members. The following table presents advances outstanding, by type of institution, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  ADVANCES OUTSTANDING BY PRODUCT TYPE 
  (par value, dollars in millions) 

The Bank is required by statute and regulation to obtain sufficient collateral from members/borrowers to fully secure all advances and other extensions of credit. The Bank s collateral arrangements with its members/borrowers and the types of collateral it accepts to secure advances are described in the   2015   10-K. To ensure the value of collateral pledged to the Bank is sufficient to secure its advances, the Bank applies various haircuts, or discounts, to determine the value of the collateral against which borrowers may borrow. From time to time, the Bank reevaluates the adequacy of its collateral haircuts under a range of stress scenarios to ensure that its collateral haircuts are sufficient to protect the Bank from credit losses on advances.  
  In addition, as described in the   2015   10-K, the Bank reviews the financial condition of its depository institution borrowers on at least a quarterly basis to identify any borrowers whose financial condition indicates they might pose an increased credit risk and, as needed, takes appropriate action. The Bank has not experienced any credit losses on advances since it was founded in 1932 and, based on its credit extension and collateral policies, management currently does not anticipate any credit losses on advances. Accordingly, the Bank has not provided any allowance for losses on advances. 
   
  Short-Term Liquidity Holdings 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s short-term liquidity holdings were comprised of   $6.8 billion   of overnight federal funds sold and   $3.3 billion   of overnight reverse repurchase agreements. At   December 31, 2015  , the Bank s short-term liquidity holdings were comprised of   $2.2 billion   of overnight federal funds sold, a $1.0 billion overnight reverse repurchase agreement and   $0.8 billion   of non-interest bearing excess cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. All of the Bank's federal funds sold during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were transacted with domestic bank counterparties and U.S. branches of foreign financial institutions on an overnight basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s overnight federal funds sold consisted of   $2.5 billion   sold to counterparties rated double-A,   $3.8 billion   sold to counterparties rated single-A and   $0.5 billion   sold to counterparties rated triple-B. The credit ratings presented in the preceding sentence represent the lowest long-term rating assigned to the counterparty by Moody s, S P or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. ( Fitch ).  
  The amount of the Bank s short-term liquidity holdings fluctuates in response to several factors, including the anticipated demand for advances, the timing and extent of advance prepayments, changes in the Bank s deposit balances, the Bank s pre-funding activities, prevailing conditions (or anticipated changes in conditions) in the short-term debt markets, changes in the returns provided by short-term investment alternatives relative to the Bank s discount note funding costs, the level of liquidity needed to satisfy Finance Agency requirements and, on and after July 14, 2015, the Finance Agency's expectations with regard to the Bank's core mission achievement. For a discussion of the Finance Agency s liquidity requirements, see the section below entitled  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  For a discussion of the Finance Agency's guidance regarding core mission achievement, see Item 1 - Business - Legislative and Regulatory Developments in the 2015 10-K. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's core mission asset ("CMA") ratio was 60.73 percent. In comparison, the Bank's CMA ratio was 55.96 percent for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Long-Term Investments 
  The composition of the Bank's long-term investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is set forth in the table below.  
  COMPOSITION OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
  (in millions) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the U.S. government and the issuers of the Bank's holdings of GSE debentures and GSE mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") were rated triple-A by Moody's and Fitch and AA+ by S P. The Bank's holdings of other debentures, which were comprised of securities issued by the Private Export Funding Corporation ("PEFCO"), are currently rated triple-A by Moody's and Fitch. The PEFCO debentures are not currently rated by S P. The credit ratings associated with the Bank's holdings of non-agency residential MBS ("RMBS") are presented in the table on page 53. 
  
    51 

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank acquired (based on trade date) $1.9 billion of GSE commercial MBS ("CMBS"), $3.7 billion of GSE debentures and $0.3 billion of U.S. Treasury Notes, all of which were classified as available-for-sale. All of the Bank's CMBS holdings are backed by multi-family loans. During this same   nine  -month period, the proceeds from maturities and paydowns of held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities totaled approximately   $434.3 million   and   $37.2 million  , respectively. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank sold approximately $130 million (par value) of GSE RMBS classified as held-to-maturity securities. The aggregate gains recognized on these sales totaled $0.8 million. For each of these securities, the Bank had previously collected at least 85 percent of the principal outstanding at the time of acquisition. As such, the sales were considered maturities for purposes of security classification. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested in higher yielding GSE CMBS. During this same   nine  -month period, the Bank sold approximately $2.6 billion (par value) of non-MBS securities classified as available-for-sale. The aggregate gains recognized on these sales totaled $5.1 million. The non-MBS securities that were sold were largely replaced with longer-dated, higher yielding GSE debentures. 
  The Bank is precluded by regulation from purchasing additional MBS if such purchase would cause the aggregate amortized cost of its MBS holdings to exceed 300 percent of the Bank s total regulatory capital (the sum of its capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock and retained earnings). However, the Bank is not required to sell any mortgage securities that it purchased at a time when it was in compliance with this ratio. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held   $8.3 billion   (amortized cost) of MBS, which represented   310 percent   of its total regulatory capital as of that date. The Bank intends to continue to purchase additional GSE MBS if securities with adequate returns are available when the Bank has the regulatory capacity to increase its MBS portfolio. 
  In addition to MBS, the Bank is also permitted under applicable policies and regulations to purchase certain other types of highly rated, long-term, non-MBS investments (including but not limited to the non-MBS debt obligations of other GSEs, subject to certain limits). Subject to applicable regulatory limits and the constraints imposed by the Finance Agency's guidance regarding core mission achievement, the Bank may continue to add these types of securities to its long-term investment portfolio if attractive opportunities to do so are available.  
  Gross unrealized losses on the Bank s MBS investments decreased from $102.7 million at   December 31, 2015   to $68.8 million at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , $56.4 million of the gross unrealized losses related to the Bank s holdings of  GSE CMBS,   $8.1 million   related to non-agency RMBS and $4.3 million related to GSE RMBS. 
  The Bank evaluates all outstanding held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of the end of each calendar quarter for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ). An investment security is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. For a summary of the Bank s OTTI evaluation, see  Item 1. Financial Statements  (specifically, Notes 4 and 5 beginning on pages 9 and 12, respectively, of this report). 
  The deterioration in the U.S. housing markets that occurred primarily during the period from 2007 through 2011, as reflected during that period by declines in the values of residential real estate and higher levels of delinquencies, defaults and losses on residential mortgages, including the mortgages underlying the Bank s non-agency RMBS, generally increased the risk that the Bank may not ultimately recover the entire cost bases of some of its non-agency RMBS. However, based upon its analysis of the securities in this portfolio, the Bank believes that the unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   were principally the result of liquidity risk related discounts in the non-agency RMBS market and do not accurately reflect the currently likely future credit performance of the securities.

All but one of the Bank s non-agency RMBS are rated by one or more of the following NRSROs: Moody s, S P and/or Fitch. The following table presents the credit ratings assigned to the Bank s non-agency RMBS holdings as of   September 30, 2016  . The credit ratings presented in the table represent the lowest rating assigned to the security by Moody s, S P or Fitch. 
    
  NON-AGENCY RMBS CREDIT RATINGS 
  (dollars in thousands) 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s portfolio of non-agency RMBS was comprised of 5 securities with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $18 million that are backed by first lien fixed-rate loans and 19 securities with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $112 million that are backed by first lien option adjustable-rate mortgage ( option ARM ) loans. In comparison, as of   December 31, 2015  , the Bank s portfolio of non-agency RMBS was comprised of 8 securities backed by fixed-rate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $25 million and 19 securities backed by option ARM loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $128 million. Three of the Bank's unimpaired non-agency RMBS were paid in full during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. A summary of the Bank s non-agency RMBS as of   December 31, 2015   by classification by the originator at the time of issuance and collateral type is presented in the   2015   10-K; there were no material changes to this information during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  To assess whether the entire amortized cost bases of its non-agency RMBS are likely to be recovered, the Bank performed a cash flow analysis for each of its non-agency RMBS holdings as of   September 30, 2016   under a base case (or best estimate) scenario. The procedures used in this analysis, together with the results thereof, are summarized in  Item 1. Financial Statements  (specifically, Note 5 beginning on page 12 of this report).  
  Since 2009, the Bank has recorded credit impairments totaling $13.1 million on 15 of its non-agency RMBS. The vast majority of these credit impairments were recorded in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Bank has amortized $0.4 million of the time value associated with these credit losses. Through this same date, actual principal shortfalls on these securities have totaled $1.9 million and the Bank has recognized recoveries (i.e., increases in cash flows expected to be collected) totaling $2.3 million. Based on the cash flow analyses performed as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank currently expects to recover in future periods an additional $8.7 million of the previously recorded losses. These anticipated recoveries will be accreted as interest income over the remaining lives of the applicable securities in the same manner as the recoveries that have been recorded through   September 30, 2016  . 
  In addition to evaluating its non-agency RMBS under a best estimate scenario, the Bank also performed a cash flow analysis for each of these securities as of   September 30, 2016   under a more stressful housing price scenario. This more stressful scenario was based on a housing price forecast that assumed home price changes for the 12-month period beginning   July 1, 2016   were 5 percentage points lower than the base case scenario followed by home price changes that are 33 percent lower than those used in the base case scenario. Under the more stressful housing price scenario, an additional $1,000 of credit impairment would have been recorded as of   September 30, 2016   on the one security that was deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired at that date under the best estimate scenario. None of the Bank s other non-agency RMBS would have been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired under the more stressful housing price scenario. 
  While substantially all of the Bank's RMBS portfolio is comprised of collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") with variable-rate coupons ($2.5 billion par value at   September 30, 2016  ) that do not expose it to interest rate risk if interest rates rise moderately, these securities include caps that would limit increases in the variable-rate coupons if short-term interest rates rise above the caps. In addition, if interest rates rise, prepayments on the mortgage loans underlying the securities would likely decline, thus lengthening the time that the securities would remain outstanding with their coupon rates capped. As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR was   0.53   percent and the effective interest rate caps on one-month LIBOR (the interest cap rate minus the stated spread on the coupon) embedded in the CMO floaters ranged from 5.95 percent to 15.29 percent. The  
  
    53 

     Table of Contents  

largest concentration of embedded effective caps ($2.0 billion) was between 6.00 percent and 6.50 percent. As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR rates were 542 basis points below the lowest effective interest rate cap embedded in the CMO floaters. To hedge a portion of the potential cap risk embedded in these securities, the Bank held   $1.2 billion   of interest rate caps with remaining maturities ranging from   24 months   to   59 months   as of   September 30, 2016  , and strike rates of   6.50 percent  . If interest rates rise above the strike rates specified in these interest rate cap agreements, the Bank will be entitled to receive interest payments according to the terms and conditions of such agreements. These payments would be based upon the notional amounts of those agreements and the difference between 6.50 percent and three-month LIBOR. 
  The following table provides a summary of the notional amounts and expiration periods of the Bank s portfolio of stand-alone CMO-related interest rate cap agreements as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  SUMMARY OF CMO-RELATED INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENTS 
  (dollars in millions) 

Consolidated Obligations and Deposits 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s outstanding consolidated obligation bonds (at par value) increased by   $5.1 billion   and its outstanding consolidated obligation discount notes increased by   $10.6 billion  . The following table presents the composition of the Bank s outstanding bonds at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  COMPOSITION OF CONSOLIDATED OBLIGATION BONDS OUTSTANDING 
  (par value, dollars in millions) 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Bank issued   $19.1 billion   of consolidated obligation bonds and approximately   $103.9 billion   of consolidated obligation discount notes (excluding those with overnight terms), the proceeds of which were used primarily to replace maturing or called consolidated obligation bonds and maturing discount notes, as well as to fund the increases in the Bank's investment and advances portfolios. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , discount notes comprised approximately   57   percent and   53   percent, respectively, of the Bank's total outstanding consolidated obligations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's bond issuance (based on par value) consisted of approximately $8.7 billion of variable-rate bonds, $4.8 billion of fixed-rate non-callable bonds (most of which were swapped), and $5.6 billion of swapped fixed-rate callable bonds (including step-up and step-down bonds). 
    
  The weighted average cost of swapped and variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds issued by the Bank approximated LIBOR minus 19 basis points during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to LIBOR minus 14 basis points during the three months ended June 30, 2016, LIBOR minus 12 basis points during the three months ended March 31, 2016   
  
    54 

     Table of Contents  

and LIBOR minus 12 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Bank's funding levels (relative to LIBOR) for consolidated obligation bonds deteriorated in the second half of 2015 due to a significant decrease in swap spreads during that period and an increase in competing debt issuance by other GSEs. Swap spreads tightened relative to U.S. Treasury debt during the second half of 2015 due to several factors, including a large volume of swapped corporate debt issuance, a rise in repo rates and increased sales of U.S. Treasury debt by central banks. Swap spreads widened during the second and third quarters of 2016, resulting in an improvement in the Bank's funding levels (relative to LIBOR) for consolidated obligation bonds. The widening of swap spreads was mainly due to the then impending changes to the rules that govern money market funds. 
  The cost of the Bank's consolidated obligation discount notes also increased during the second half of 2015 due to short term debt investors' desire to invest only in very short maturity instruments, which was attributable to the uncertainty at that time regarding potential interest rate increases by the FOMC at its September 2015 and December 2015 meetings. Dealers' reduced capacity to hold consolidated obligation discount notes (due to balance sheet constraints) also contributed to the increase in the Bank's discount note funding costs during the second half of 2015. While dealers' balance sheets were less constrained during the first quarter of 2016, the cost of discount notes increased commensurate with the increase in short-term interest rates during the first quarter of 2016. The cost of discount notes continued to increase early in the second quarter, primarily due to uncertainty regarding future rate increases by the FOMC. Toward the end of the second quarter and continuing into the third quarter, the Bank's discount note funding costs improved due in part to Great Britain's vote to exit the European Union and the then impending changes to the rules that govern money market funds, each of which contributed to increased demand for discount notes. 
  Demand and term deposits were   $1.1 billion   and   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The size of the Bank s deposit base varies as market factors change, including the attractiveness of the Bank s deposit pricing relative to the rates available to members on alternative money market investments, members  investment preferences with respect to the maturity of their investments, and member liquidity. 
   
  Capital 
  The Bank s outstanding capital stock (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) was   $1.9 billion   and   $1.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Bank s average outstanding capital stock (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) increased from $1.4 billion for the year ended   December 31, 2015   to   $1.7 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Mandatorily redeemable capital stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $2.3 million   and   $8.9 million  , respectively. Although mandatorily redeemable capital stock is excluded from capital (equity) for financial reporting purposes, it is considered capital for regulatory purposes.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank s five largest shareholders collectively held   $350 million   and   $278 million  , respectively, of capital stock, which represented   18.6   percent and   17.9 percent  , respectively, of the Bank s total outstanding capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) as of those dates. The following table presents the Bank s five largest shareholders as of   September 30, 2016  .

  CAPITAL STOCK OUTSTANDING BY INSTITUTION TYPE 
  (par value, dollars in millions) 

Members are required to maintain an investment in Class B Stock equal to the sum of a membership investment requirement and an activity-based investment requirement. The membership investment requirement is currently 0.04 percent of each member s total assets as of the previous calendar year-end, subject to a minimum of $1,000 and a maximum of $7,000,000. The activity-based investment requirement is currently 4.1 percent of outstanding advances, except for advances that were funded under the Bank's special reduced stock advances offering that ran from October 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The activity-based investment requirement for those advances was (and continues to be) 2.0 percent of the outstanding advances. Class B-1 Stock is used to meet the membership investment requirement and Class B-2 Stock is used to meet the activity-based investment requirement.  
  Quarterly, the Bank generally repurchases a portion of members  excess capital stock. Excess capital stock is defined as the amount of stock held by a member (or former member) in excess of that institution s minimum investment requirement. The portion of members  excess capital stock subject to repurchase is known as surplus stock. For the repurchases that occurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , surplus stock was defined as the amount of stock held by a shareholder in excess of   125 percent   of the shareholder s minimum investment requirement. For those repurchases, which occurred on    February 25, 2016  ,   June 27, 2016   and   September 27, 2016  , a shareholder's surplus stock was not repurchased if: (1) the amount of that shareholder's surplus stock was   $2,500,000   or less; (2) the shareholder elected to opt-out of the repurchase; or (3) the shareholder was on restricted collateral status (subject to certain exceptions). On   February 25, 2016  ,   June 27, 2016   and   September 27, 2016  , the Bank repurchased surplus stock totaling   $103,707,000  ,   $60,999,000   and   $47,783,000  , respectively, none of which was classified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock at those dates.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s excess stock totaled   $380.2 million  , which represented   0.7   percent of the Bank s total assets as of that date. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s retained earnings increased by   $38.4 million  , from   $762.2 million   to   $800.6 million  . During this same period, the Bank paid dividends on capital stock totaling   $12.2 million  , which represented a weighted average annualized dividend rate of 1.01 percent. The Bank s first quarter dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.375 percent (as average one-month LIBOR for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.251 percent) and 1.251 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the fourth quarter of 2015 plus 1.0 percent), respectively. The first quarter dividends, which were applied to average Class B-1 Stock and average Class B-2 Stock held during the period from October 1,   2015   through December 31,   2015  , were paid on March 31,   2016  . The Bank s second quarter dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.431 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the first quarter of 2016) and 1.431 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the first quarter of 2016 plus 1.0 percent), respectively. The second quarter dividends, which were applied to average Class B-1 Stock and average Class B-2 Stock held during the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016, were paid on June 28,   2016  . The Bank s third quarter dividends on Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock were paid at annualized rates of 0.444 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the second quarter of 2016) and 1.444 percent (a rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the second quarter of 2016 plus 1.0 percent), respectively. The third quarter dividends, which were applied to average Class B-1 Stock and average Class B-2 Stock held during the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, were paid on September 28,   2016  .

While there can be no assurances, taking into consideration its current earnings expectations and anticipated market conditions, the Bank currently expects to pay dividends on Class B-1 Stock during the fourth quarter of   2016   at an annualized rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the third quarter of 2016. Further, the Bank currently expects to pay dividends on Class B-2 Stock at an annualized rate equal to average one-month LIBOR for the third quarter of 2016 plus 1.0 percent. 
  The Bank is required to maintain at all times permanent capital in an amount at least equal to its risk-based capital requirement, which is the sum of its credit risk capital requirement, its market risk capital requirement, and its operations risk capital requirement, as further described in the   2015   10-K.  Permanent capital is defined under the Finance Agency s rules as retained earnings and amounts paid in for Class B stock (which for the Bank includes both Class B-1 Stock and Class B-2 Stock), regardless of its classification as equity or liabilities for financial reporting purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s total risk-based capital requirement was   $707 million  , comprised of credit risk, market risk and operations risk capital requirements of   $363 million  ,   $181 million   and   $163 million  , respectively, and its permanent capital was   $2.7 billion  . 
  In addition to the risk-based capital requirement, the Bank is subject to two other capital requirements. First, the Bank must, at all times, maintain a minimum total capital-to-assets ratio of 4.0 percent. For this purpose, total capital is defined by Finance Agency rules and regulations as the Bank s permanent capital and the amount of any general allowance for losses (i.e., those reserves that are not held against specific assets). Second, the Bank is required to maintain at all times a minimum leverage capital-to-assets ratio in an amount at least equal to 5.0 percent of its total assets. In applying this requirement to the Bank, leverage capital includes the Bank s permanent capital multiplied by a factor of 1.5 plus the amount of any general allowance for losses. The Bank did not have any general allowance for losses at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . Under the regulatory definitions, total capital and permanent capital exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At all times during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's total capital-to-assets and leverage capital-to-assets ratios were   4.60 percent   and   6.90 percent  , respectively. For a summary of the Bank s compliance with the Finance Agency s capital requirements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , see  Item 1. Financial Statements  (specifically, Note 12 on page 32 of this report). 
   
  Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  The Bank enters into interest rate swap, swaption, cap and forward rate agreements (collectively, interest rate exchange agreements) to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and/or to adjust the effective maturity, repricing index and/or frequency or option characteristics of financial instruments. This use of derivatives is integral to the Bank s financial management strategy, and the impact of these interest rate exchange agreements permeates the Bank s financial statements. For additional discussion, see  Item 1. Financial Statements  (specifically, Note 11 beginning on page 25 of this report).

The Bank has transacted some of its interest rate exchange agreements bilaterally with large financial institutions (with which it has in place master agreements). In doing so, the Bank has generally exchanged a defined market risk for the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligations in the future. The Bank manages this credit risk by spreading its transactions among as many highly rated counterparties as is practicable, by entering into master agreements with each of its non-member bilateral counterparties that include maximum unsecured credit exposure thresholds ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, and by monitoring its exposure to each counterparty on a daily basis. In addition, all of the Bank s master agreements with its bilateral counterparties include netting arrangements whereby the fair values of all interest rate derivatives (including accrued interest receivables and payables) with each counterparty are offset for purposes of measuring credit exposure. As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional balances of outstanding interest rate exchange agreements transacted with non-member bilateral counterparties totaled   $10.3 billion  . 
  Under the Bank s master agreements with its non-member bilateral counterparties, the unsecured credit exposure thresholds must be met before collateral is required to be delivered by one party to the other party. Once the counterparties agree to the valuations of the interest rate exchange agreements, and if it is determined that the unsecured credit exposure exceeds the threshold, then, upon a request made by the unsecured counterparty, the party that has the unsecured obligation to the counterparty bearing the risk of the unsecured credit exposure generally must deliver sufficient collateral (or return a sufficient amount of previously remitted collateral) to reduce the unsecured credit exposure to zero (or, in the case of pledged securities, to an amount equal to the discount applied to the securities under the terms of the master agreement). Collateral is delivered (or returned) daily when these thresholds are met. The master agreements with the Bank's non-member bilateral counterparties require the delivery of collateral consisting of cash or very liquid, highly rated securities (generally consisting of U.S. government-guaranteed or agency debt securities) if credit risk exposures rise above the thresholds.  
  As a result of statutory and regulatory requirements emanating from the Dodd-Frank Act, certain derivative transactions that the Bank enters into are required to be cleared through a third-party central clearinghouse. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had cleared trades outstanding with notional amounts totaling   $26.9 billion  . Cleared trades are subject to initial and variation margin requirements established by the clearinghouse and its clearing members. Collateral is typically delivered (or returned) daily and, unlike bilateral derivatives, is not subject to any maximum unsecured credit exposure thresholds. The fair values of all interest rate derivatives (including accrued interest receivables and payables) with each clearing member of each clearinghouse are offset for purposes of measuring credit exposure and determining initial and variation margin requirements. With cleared transactions, the Bank is exposed to credit risk in the event that the clearinghouse or the clearing member fails to meet its obligations to the Bank. The Bank has determined that the exercise by a non-defaulting party of the setoff rights incorporated in its cleared derivative transactions should be upheld in the event of a default, including a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the clearinghouse or any of its clearing members or both. 
  The notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements does not reflect the Bank s credit risk exposure, which is much less than the notional amount. The Bank's net credit risk exposure is based on the current estimated cost, on a present value basis, of replacing at current market rates all interest rate exchange agreements with individual counterparties, if those counterparties were to default, after taking into account the value of any cash and/or securities collateral held or remitted by the Bank. For counterparties with which the Bank is in a net gain position, the Bank has credit exposure when the collateral it is holding (if any) has a value less than the amount of the gain. For counterparties with which the Bank is in a net loss position, the Bank has credit exposure when it has delivered collateral with a value greater than the amount of the loss position.

    This product offering and the collateral provisions associated therewith are discussed in the paragraph below. 
     The Bank offers interest rate swaps, caps and floors to its members to assist them in meeting their risk management objectives. In derivative transactions with its members, the Bank acts as an intermediary by entering into an interest rate exchange agreement with the member and then entering into an offsetting interest rate exchange agreement with one of the Bank s non-member derivative counterparties discussed above. When entering into interest rate exchange agreements with its members, the Bank requires the member to post eligible collateral in an amount equal to the sum of the net market value of the member s derivative transactions with the Bank (if the value is positive to the Bank) plus a percentage of the notional amount of any interest rate swaps, with market values determined on at least a monthly basis. Eligible collateral for derivative transactions consists of collateral that is eligible to secure advances and other obligations under the member s Advances and Security Agreement with the Bank. 
  The Dodd-Frank Act changed the regulatory framework for derivative transactions that are not subject to mandatory clearing requirements (uncleared trades). While the Bank expects to be able in certain instances to continue to enter into uncleared trades on a bilateral basis, those transactions will be subject to new regulatory requirements, including minimum margin

requirements imposed by regulators. For additional discussion, see Item 1 - Business - Legislative and Regulatory Developments in the 2015 10-K. 
   
  Market Value of Equity 
  The ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of equity to its book value of equity was approximately   104 percent   and   105 percent   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Results of Operations 
  Net Income 
  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $21.1 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively. The Bank s net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   represented an annualized return on average capital stock ( ROCS ) of   4.49 percent  . In comparison, the Bank s ROCS was   1.55   percent for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $50.6 million   and   $52.5 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's ROCS was   3.89 percent  . In comparison, the Bank s ROCS was   5.37   percent for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . To derive the Bank s ROCS, net income is divided by average capital stock outstanding excluding stock that is classified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The factors contributing to the changes in the Bank's net income are discussed below. 
  Income Before Assessments 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank s income before assessments was   $23.5 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively. As discussed in more detail below, the $17.3 million increase in income before assessments from period to period was attributable to a $16.3 million increase in net interest income and a $5.7 million favorable change in other income (loss), offset by a $4.7 million increase in other expense.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank s income before assessments was   $56.2 million   and   $58.3 million  , respectively. As discussed in more detail below, the $2.1 million decrease in income before assessments from period to period was attributable to a $24.7 million unfavorable change in other income (loss) and a $6.8 million increase in other expense, offset by a $29.4 million increase in net interest income.  
  The components of income before assessments (net interest income, other income/loss and other expense) are discussed in more detail in the following sections. 
  Net Interest Income 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank s net interest income was   $44.7 million   and   $28.3 million  , respectively. The Bank s net interest income was   $118.2 million   and   $88.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in net interest income for both the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   was due primarily to an increase in the average balances of the Bank's interest-earning assets. The Bank's average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $43.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $57.2 billion during the comparable period in 2016. For the nine-month periods, the Bank's average balance of interest-earning assets increased from $42.8 billion in 2015 to $52.0 billion in 2016. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank s net interest margin was   31   basis points and   27   basis points, respectively. The Bank s net interest margin was   30   basis points and   28   basis points for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net interest margin, or net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, is a function of net interest spread and the rates of return on assets funded by the investment of the Bank s capital. Net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank s net interest spread was   28   basis points and   27   basis points for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   25   basis points and   26   basis points for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  The contribution of earnings from the Bank s invested capital to the net interest margin (the impact of non-interest bearing funds) increased from   2   basis points during both the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   3   basis points during both the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to an increase in short-term interest rates.

Hedge Ineffectiveness 
  The Bank uses interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of some of its advances and consolidated obligation bonds and substantially all of its available-for-sale securities. These hedging relationships are designated as fair value hedges. To the extent these relationships qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair values of both the derivative (the interest rate swap) and the hedged item (limited to changes attributable to the hedged risk) are recorded in earnings. For those relationships that qualified for hedge accounting, the differences between the change in fair value of the hedged items and the change in fair value of the associated interest rate swaps (representing hedge ineffectiveness) were net gains (losses) of   $2.1 million   and   $(10.7) million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $(23.2) million   and   $(0.4) million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. To the extent these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, or cease to qualify because they are determined to be ineffective, only the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in earnings (in this case, there is no offsetting change in fair value of the hedged item). For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the change in the fair value of derivatives associated with specific advances, available-for-sale securities and consolidated obligation bonds that were not in qualifying hedging relationships was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. The change in the fair value of derivatives associated with specific advances, available-for-sale securities and consolidated obligation bonds that were not in qualifying hedging relationships was   $(2.1) million   and   $2.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The increase in fair value hedge ineffectiveness during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was due in large part to the addition of higher yielding, longer duration GSE CMBS and GSE debentures to the Bank s available-for-sale securities portfolio during the last nine months of 2015 and the first   nine   months of 2016. While the fair value hedge ineffectiveness related to this portfolio was not as significant during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the period to period change of $8.5 million (a $2.2 million gain vs. a $6.3 million loss, respectively) contributed significantly to the favorable change in net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities between the two quarterly periods. Substantially all of the Bank s GSE CMBS and GSE debentures classified as available-for-sale are hedged with fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps in long-haul hedging relationships. The hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses associated with these particular relationships are attributable in large part to the use of different discount curves to value the interest rate swaps (OIS) and the GSE CMBS/GSE debentures (LIBOR plus a constant spread). Notwithstanding the hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses, these hedging relationships have been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values attributable to the hedged risk. While the ineffectiveness-related gains and losses associated with these hedging relationships can be significant when evaluated in the context of the Bank s net income, they are relatively small when expressed as a percentage of the values of the positions. Because the Bank expects to hold these interest rate swaps to maturity, the unrealized ineffectiveness-related gains (or losses) associated with its holdings of GSE CMBS and GSE debentures are expected to be transitory, meaning that they will reverse in future periods in the form of ineffectiveness-related losses (or gains). 
  Economic Hedge Derivatives 
  Notwithstanding the transitory nature of the ineffectiveness-related gains and losses associated with the Bank's available-for-sale securities portfolio (discussed above), the Bank has entered into several derivative transactions in an effort to mitigate a portion of the periodic earnings variability that can result from those fair value hedging relationships. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the gains (losses) associated with stand-alone economic hedge derivatives used for this purpose were   $(1.9) million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively. 
  As discussed previously in the section entitled  Financial Condition   Long-Term Investments,  to hedge a portion of the risk associated with a significant increase in short-term interest rates, the Bank held, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   3   interest rate cap agreements having a total notional amount of   $1.2 billion  . The premiums paid for these caps totaled   $4.3 million  . The fair values of interest rate cap agreements are dependent upon the level of interest rates, volatilities and remaining term to maturity. In general (assuming constant volatilities and no erosion in value attributable to the passage of time), interest rate caps will increase in value as market interest rates rise and will diminish in value as market interest rates decline. The value of interest rate caps will increase as volatilities increase and will decline as volatilities decrease. Absent changes in volatilities or interest rates, the value of interest rate caps will decline with the passage of time. As stand-alone derivatives, the changes in the fair values of the Bank s interest rate cap agreements are recorded in earnings with no offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedged CMO LIBOR floaters with embedded caps and therefore can be a source of volatility in the Bank s earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying values of the Bank s stand-alone interest rate cap agreements totaled   $0.2 million  .  
  From time to time, the Bank hedges the risk of changes in the fair value of some of its longer-term consolidated obligation discount notes using fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional balance of these swaps totaled   $3.7 billion  . As stand-alone derivatives, the changes in the fair values of the Bank s discount note swaps are recorded in earnings with no offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedged items (i.e., the consolidated obligation discount notes) and therefore can also be a source of volatility in the Bank s earnings.

Other 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank sold approximately $130 million (par value) and $757 million (par value), respectively, of GSE RMBS classified as held-to-maturity securities. The aggregate gains recognized on these sales totaled   $0.8 million   and   $13.4 million  , respectively. For each of these securities, the Bank had previously collected at least 85 percent of the principal outstanding at the time of acquisition. As such, the sales were considered maturities for purposes of security classification. During these same   nine  -month periods, the Bank sold approximately $2.3 billion (par value) and $0.7 billion (par value), respectively, of shorter maturity GSE debentures classified as available-for-sale. In addition, the Bank sold $0.3 billion (par value) of U.S. Treasury Notes classified as available-for-sale during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate gains recognized on these sales totaled   $5.1 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively.  
  During September and October 2015, the Bank acquired fixed rate U.S. Treasury Notes with par values of $104.8 million and $100.0 million, respectively. Each of these securities was classified as trading. Due to fluctuations in long-term interest rates, gains (losses) on the security acquired in September 2015 totaled $(1.1) million and $6.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Prior to its sale in June 2016, the U.S. Treasury Note that was acquired in October 2015 generated current year gains of $2.3 million. While held by the Bank, this U.S. Treasury Note was economically hedged with a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap; during 2016, this swap, which was terminated concurrent with the sale of the U.S. Treasury Note, produced losses of $2.1 million.  
  For a discussion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss on one of the Bank's held-to-maturity securities, see  Item 1. Financial Statements  (specifically, Note 5 beginning on page 12 of this report). 
  Other Expense 
  Total other expense, which includes the Bank s compensation and benefits, other operating expenses, discretionary grant programs, derivative clearing fees and its proportionate share of the costs of operating the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance, totaled   $23.6 million   and   $62.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $18.9 million   and   $55.8 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  . 
  Compensation and benefits were   $14.5 million   and   $38.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $11.0 million   and   $31.5 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  . The $3.5 million increase in compensation and benefits for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, was due largely to: (1) increased costs associated with the Bank's participation in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions; (2) increased costs associated with the Bank's 2014 and 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plans, due largely to the retroactive inclusion (in August 2016) of additional executives in these plans (based on the date that these executives joined the Bank's Executive Management Committee) and higher anticipated goal achievement for the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan; (3) increased employee medical costs; (4) an increase in headcount; and (5) merit and cost-of-living adjustments. The $6.6 million increase in compensation and benefits for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, was due largely to the increases described above as it relates to the quarter-to-quarter comparison, partially offset by a reduction in employee separation costs. Average headcount increased from 205 and 201 employees for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, to 213 employees for each of the corresponding periods in   2016  .  
  Other operating expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $6.8 million   and   $18.0 million  , respectively, compared to   $6.2 million   and   $19.2 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  . The fluctuations in other operating expenses for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, resulted from offsetting increases and decreases in many of the Bank's other operating expenses, none of which were individually significant. 
  Derivative clearing fees were   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  . The increase in derivative clearing fees was attributable to the higher volume of cleared trades in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
  The Bank, together with the other FHLBanks, is assessed for the costs of operating the Finance Agency and the Office of Finance. The Bank s share of these expenses totaled   $1.5 million   and   $4.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $1.2 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively, for the corresponding periods in   2015  .  
  AHP Assessments 
  While the Bank is exempt from all federal, state and local income taxes, it is obligated to set aside amounts for its Affordable Housing Program ( AHP ). 
  As required by statute, each year the Bank contributes 10 percent of its earnings (as adjusted for interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock) to its AHP. The AHP provides grants that members can use to support affordable housing  
  
    69 

     Table of Contents  

projects in their communities. Generally, the Bank s AHP assessment is derived by adding interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock to income before assessments; the result of this calculation is then multiplied by 10 percent. The Bank s AHP assessments totaled   $2.3 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.6 million   and   $5.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  A discussion of the Bank s critical accounting policies and the extent to which management uses judgment and estimates in applying those policies is provided in the   2015   10-K. There were no substantial changes to the Bank s critical accounting policies, or the extent to which management uses judgment and estimates in applying those policies, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  In order to meet members  credit needs and the Bank s financial obligations, the Bank maintains a portfolio of money market instruments typically consisting of overnight federal funds and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. From time to time, the Bank may also invest in short-term commercial paper, U.S. Treasury Bills and GSE discount notes. Beyond those amounts that are required to meet members  credit needs and its own obligations, the Bank typically holds additional balances of short-term investments that fluctuate as the Bank invests the proceeds of debt issued to replace maturing and called liabilities, as the balance of deposits changes, as the returns provided by short-term investments vary relative to the costs of the Bank s discount notes, and as the level of liquidity needed to satisfy Finance Agency requirements changes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s short-term liquidity portfolio was comprised of   $6.8 billion   of overnight federal funds sold and   $3.3 billion   of overnight reverse repurchase agreements.  
  The Bank s primary source of funds is the proceeds it receives from the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes in the capital markets. Historically, the FHLBanks have issued debt throughout the business day in the form of discount notes and bonds with a wide variety of maturities and structures. Generally, the Bank has access to the capital markets as needed during the business day to acquire funds to meet its needs. 
  In addition to the liquidity provided from the proceeds of the issuance of consolidated obligations, the Bank also maintains access to wholesale funding sources such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (e.g., borrowings secured by its investments in MBS and/or agency debentures). Furthermore, the Bank has access to borrowings (typically short-term) from the other FHLBanks. 
  The 11 FHLBanks and the Office of Finance are parties to the Federal Home Loan Banks P I Funding and Contingency Plan Agreement (the  Contingency Agreement ). The Contingency Agreement and related procedures are designed to facilitate the timely funding of principal and interest payments on FHLBank System consolidated obligations in the event that a FHLBank is not able to meet its funding obligations in a timely manner. The Contingency Agreement and related procedures provide for the issuance of overnight consolidated obligations ("Plan COs") directly to one or more FHLBanks that provide funds to avoid a shortfall in the timely payment of principal and interest on any consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The direct placement by a FHLBank of consolidated obligations with another FHLBank is permitted only in those instances when direct placement of consolidated obligations is necessary to ensure that sufficient funds are available to timely pay all principal and interest on FHLBank System consolidated obligations due on a particular day. Through the date of this report, no Plan COs have ever been issued pursuant to the terms of the Contingency Agreement. 
  On occasion, and as an alternative to issuing new debt, the Bank may assume the outstanding consolidated obligations for which other FHLBanks are the original primary obligors. This occurs in cases where the original primary obligor may have participated in a large consolidated obligation issue to an extent that exceeded its immediate funding needs in order to facilitate better market execution for the issue. The original primary obligor might then warehouse the funds until they were needed, or make the funds available to other FHLBanks. Transfers may also occur when the original primary obligor s funding needs change, and that FHLBank offers to transfer debt that is no longer needed to other FHLBanks. Transferred debt is typically fixed-rate, fixed-term, non-callable debt, and may be in the form of discount notes or bonds. 
  The Bank participates in such transfers of funding from other FHLBanks when the transfer represents favorable pricing relative to a new issue of consolidated obligations with similar features. The Bank did not assume any consolidated obligations from other FHLBanks during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  The Bank manages its liquidity to ensure that, at a minimum, it has sufficient funds to meet operational and contingent liquidity requirements. When measuring its liquidity for these purposes, the Bank includes only contractual cash flows and the amount of funds it estimates would be available in the event the Bank were to use securities held in its long-term investment portfolio as collateral for repurchase agreements. While it believes purchased federal funds might be available as a source of funds, it does not include this potential source of funds in its calculations of available liquidity.

The Bank s operational liquidity requirement stipulates that it have sufficient funds to meet its obligations due on any given day plus an amount equal to the statistically estimated (at the 99-percent confidence level) cash and credit needs of its members and associates for one business day during a stress period of elevated advances demand without accessing the capital markets for the sale of consolidated obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s estimated operational liquidity requirement was $5.4 billion. At that date, the Bank estimated that its operational liquidity exceeded this requirement by approximately $19.8 billion. 
  The Bank s contingent liquidity requirement further requires that it maintain adequate balance sheet liquidity and access to other funding sources should it be unable to issue consolidated obligations for five business days during a stress period of elevated advances demand. The combination of funds available from these sources must be sufficient for the Bank to meet its obligations as they come due and the cash and credit needs of its members, with the potential needs of members statistically estimated at the 99-percent confidence level. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s estimated contingent liquidity requirement was $7.2 billion. At that date, the Bank estimated that its contingent liquidity exceeded this requirement by approximately $18.1 billion. 
  In addition to the liquidity measures described above, the Bank is required, pursuant to guidance issued by the Finance Agency, to meet two daily liquidity standards, each of which assumes that the Bank is unable to access the market for consolidated obligations during a prescribed period. The first standard requires the Bank to maintain sufficient funds to meet its obligations for 15 days under a scenario in which it is assumed that members do not renew any maturing, prepaid or called advances. The second standard requires the Bank to maintain sufficient funds to meet its obligations for 5 days under a scenario in which it is assumed that members renew all maturing and called advances, with certain exceptions for very large, highly rated members. These requirements are more stringent than the 5-day contingent liquidity requirement discussed above. The Bank was in compliance with both of these liquidity requirements at all times during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Bank s access to the capital markets has never been interrupted to an extent that the Bank s ability to meet its obligations was compromised and the Bank does not currently believe that its ability to issue consolidated obligations will be impeded to that extent in the future. If, however, the Bank were unable to issue consolidated obligations for an extended period of time, the Bank would eventually exhaust the availability of purchased federal funds (including borrowings from other FHLBanks) and repurchase agreements as sources of funds. It is also possible that an event (such as a natural disaster) that might impede the Bank s ability to raise funds by issuing consolidated obligations would also limit the Bank s ability to access the markets for federal funds purchased and/or repurchase agreements. 
  Under those circumstances, to the extent that the balance of principal and interest that came due on the Bank s debt obligations and the funds needed to pay its operating expenses exceeded the cash inflows from its interest-earning assets and proceeds from maturing assets, and if access to the market for consolidated obligations was not again available, the Bank would seek to access funding under the Contingency Agreement to repay any principal and interest due on its consolidated obligations. However, if the Bank were unable to raise funds by issuing consolidated obligations, it is likely that the other FHLBanks would have similar difficulties issuing debt. If funds were not available under the Contingency Agreement, the Bank s ability to conduct its operations would be compromised even earlier than if this funding source was available. 
  A summary of the Bank s contractual cash obligations and off-balance-sheet lending-related financial commitments by due date or remaining maturity as of   December 31, 2015   is provided in the   2015   10-K. There have been no material changes in the Bank s contractual obligations outside the normal course of business during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk that are included in the   2015   10-K. The information provided in this item is intended to update the disclosures made in the   2015   10-K. 
  As a financial intermediary, the Bank is subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the level of interest rates, the slope of the interest rate yield curve, and/or the relationships (or spreads) between interest yields for different instruments have an impact on the Bank s estimated market value of equity and its net earnings. This risk arises from a variety of instruments that the Bank enters into on a regular basis in the normal course of its business. 
  The terms of member advances, investment securities, and consolidated obligations may present interest rate risk and/or embedded option risk. As discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Bank makes extensive use of interest rate derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, to manage the risk arising from these sources.

The Bank has investments in residential mortgage-related assets, primarily CMOs and, to a much smaller extent, MPF mortgage loans, both of which present prepayment risk. This risk arises from the mortgagors  option to prepay their mortgages, making the effective maturities of these mortgage-based assets relatively more sensitive to changes in interest rates and other factors that affect the mortgagors  decisions to repay their mortgages as compared to other long-term investment securities that do not have prepayment features. A decline in interest rates generally accelerates mortgage refinancing activity, thus increasing prepayments and thereby shortening the effective maturity of the mortgage-related assets. Conversely, rising rates generally slow prepayment activity and lengthen a mortgage-related asset s effective maturity.  
  The Bank has managed the potential prepayment risk embedded in mortgage assets by purchasing floating rate securities, by purchasing securities that maintain their original principal balance for a fixed number of years, by purchasing highly structured tranches of mortgage securities that substantially limit the effects of prepayment risk, by issuing debt with features similar to the mortgage assets, and/or by using interest rate derivative instruments to offset prepayment risk specific both to particular securities and to the overall mortgage portfolio.  
  The Bank s Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy provides a risk management framework for the financial management of the Bank consistent with the strategic principles outlined in its Strategic Business Plan. The Bank develops its funding and hedging strategies to manage its interest rate risk within the risk limits established in its Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy. 
  The Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy articulates the Bank s tolerance for the amount of overall interest rate risk the Bank will assume by limiting the maximum estimated loss in market value of equity that the Bank would incur under simulated 200 basis point changes in interest rates to 15 percent of the estimated base case market value. As reflected in the table below, the Bank was in compliance with this limit at each month-end during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  As part of its ongoing risk management process, the Bank calculates an estimated market value of equity for a base case interest rate scenario and for interest rate scenarios that reflect parallel interest rate shocks. The base case market value of equity is calculated by determining the estimated fair value of each instrument on the Bank s balance sheet, and subtracting the estimated aggregate fair value of the Bank s liabilities from the estimated aggregate fair value of the Bank s assets. For purposes of these calculations, mandatorily redeemable capital stock is treated as equity rather than as a liability. The fair values of the Bank s financial instruments (both assets and liabilities) are determined using vendor prices or a pricing model. For those instruments for which a pricing model is used, the calculations are based upon parameters derived from market conditions existing at the time of measurement, and are generally determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the replacement (or similar) rate for new instruments of the same type with the same or very similar characteristics. The market value of equity calculations include non-financial assets and liabilities, such as premises and equipment, other assets, payables for AHP, and other liabilities at their recorded carrying amounts. 
  For purposes of compliance with the Bank s Enterprise Market Risk Management Policy limit on estimated losses in market value, market value of equity losses are defined as the estimated net sensitivity of the value of the Bank s equity (the net value of its portfolio of assets, liabilities and interest rate derivatives) to 200 basis point parallel shifts in interest rates.

The following table provides the Bank s estimated base case market value of equity and its estimated market value of equity under up and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios (and, for comparative purposes, its estimated market value of equity under up and down 100 basis point interest rate shock scenarios) for each month-end during the period from December   2015   through   September     2016  . In addition, the table provides the percentage change in estimated market value of equity under each of these shock scenarios for the indicated periods. 
  MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY 
  (dollars in billions)   

  _____________________________ 
            (1)   
    In the up 100 and up 200 basis point scenarios, the estimated market value of equity is calculated under assumed instantaneous +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in interest rates. 
               (2)   
    The estimated market value of equity is calculated under assumed instantaneous -100 and -200 basis point parallel shifts in interest rates, subject to a floor of 0.01 percent.  
     A related measure of interest rate risk is duration of equity. Duration is the weighted average maturity (typically measured in months or years) of an instrument s cash flows, weighted by the present value of those cash flows. As such, duration provides an estimate of an instrument s sensitivity to small changes in market interest rates. The duration of assets is generally expressed as a positive figure, while the duration of liabilities is generally expressed as a negative number. The change in value of a specific instrument for given changes in interest rates will generally vary in inverse proportion to the instrument s duration. As market interest rates decline, instruments with a positive duration are expected to increase in value, while instruments with a negative duration are expected to decrease in value. Conversely, as interest rates rise, instruments with a positive duration are expected to decline in value, while instruments with a negative duration are expected to increase in value. 
  The values of instruments having relatively longer (or higher) durations are more sensitive to a given interest rate movement than instruments having shorter durations; that is, risk increases as the absolute value of duration lengthens. For instance, the value of an instrument with a duration of three years will theoretically change by three percent for every one percentage point (100 basis point) change in interest rates, while the value of an instrument with a duration of five years will theoretically change by five percent for every one percentage point change in interest rates. 
  The duration of individual instruments may be easily combined to determine the duration of a portfolio of assets or liabilities by calculating a weighted average duration of the instruments in the portfolio. These combinations provide a single straightforward metric that describes the portfolio s sensitivity to interest rate movements. These additive properties can be applied to the assets and liabilities on the Bank s balance sheet. The difference between the combined durations of the Bank s assets and the combined durations of its liabilities is sometimes referred to as duration gap and provides a measure of the relative interest rate sensitivities of the Bank s assets and liabilities. 
  Duration gap is a useful measure of interest rate sensitivity but does not account for the effect of leverage, or the effect of the absolute duration of the Bank s assets and liabilities, on the sensitivity of its estimated market value of equity to changes in interest rates. The inclusion of these factors results in a measure of the sensitivity of the value of the Bank s equity to changes in market interest rates referred to as the duration of equity. Duration of equity is the market value weighted duration of assets minus the market value weighted duration of liabilities divided by the market value of equity.

     Table of Contents  

The significance of an entity s duration of equity is that it can be used to describe the sensitivity of the entity s market value of equity to movements in interest rates. A duration of equity equal to zero would mean, within a narrow range of interest rate movements, that the Bank had neutralized the impact of changes in interest rates on the market value of its equity. 
  A positive duration of equity would mean, within a narrow range of interest rate movements, that for each one year of duration the estimated market value of the Bank s equity would be expected to decline by about 0.01 percent for every positive 0.01 percent change in the level of interest rates. A positive duration generally indicates that the value of the Bank s assets is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the value of its liabilities (i.e., that the duration of its assets is greater than the duration of its liabilities). 
  Conversely, a negative duration of equity would mean, within a narrow range of interest rate movements, that for each one year of negative duration the estimated market value of the Bank s equity would be expected to increase by about 0.01 percent for every positive 0.01 percent change in the level of interest rates. A negative duration generally indicates that the value of the Bank s liabilities is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the value of its assets (i.e., that the duration of its liabilities is greater than the duration of its assets). 
  The following table provides information regarding the Bank s base case duration of equity as well as its duration of equity in up and down 100 and 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios for each month-end during the period from December   2015   through   September     2016  . 
  DURATION ANALYSIS 
  (expressed in years) 

_____________________________ 
            (1)   
    In the up 100 and up 200 scenarios, the duration of equity is calculated under assumed instantaneous +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in interest rates. 
               (2)   
    The duration of equity was calculated under assumed instantaneous -100 and -200 basis point parallel shifts in interest rates. 
     Duration of equity measures the impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on an entity s market value of equity but may not be a good metric for measuring changes in value related to non-parallel rate shifts. An alternative measure for that purpose uses key rate durations, which measure portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates at particular points on a yield curve. Key rate duration is a specialized form of duration. It is calculated by estimating the change in value due to changing the market rate for one specific maturity point on the yield curve while holding all other variables constant. The sum of the key rate durations across an applicable yield curve is approximately equal to the overall portfolio duration. 
  The duration of equity measure represents the expected percentage change in the Bank s market value of equity for a one percentage point (100 basis point) parallel change in interest rates. The key rate duration measure represents the expected percentage change in the Bank s market value of equity for a one percentage point (100 basis point) parallel change in interest rates for a given maturity point on the yield curve, holding all other rates constant. The Bank's key rate duration limit is 5 years, measured as the difference between the maximum and minimum key rate durations calculated for 11 defined individual maturity points on the yield curve. The Bank calculates these metrics monthly and was in compliance with these policy limits at each month-end during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Bank s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Bank s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in: (1) recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Bank s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
