PART I  

Item 1. Business.  

Our Company  

Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( we ,
 our  or the  Company ), a Nevada corporation, is a specialty pharmaceutical company which develops pharmacological
treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 21, 2005
as Madrona Ventures, Inc. and, on September 16, 2009, the Company changed its name to Lightlake Therapeutics Inc. On January 28,
2016, the Company again changed its name to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Company s fiscal year end is July 31. 

The Company s strategy is to develop
pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders based on the Company s expertise using opioid
antagonists. The Company has worked on developing a treatment for reversing opioid overdoses in collaboration with the National
Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ), part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). This treatment, now
known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
in November 2015, and is marketed by Adapt Pharma Operations Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adapt Pharma Limited ( Adapt ),
an Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. 

The Company has not consistently attained profitable
operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund its operations. The Company anticipates if
revenues are not sufficient then additional funding will be required in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing from
the sale of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ), and/or financings from
the sale of interests in the Company s prospective products and/or royalty transactions. However, the Company may not be
able to generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funding to fund the Company s operations. 

The Company has not had a bankruptcy, receivership
or similar proceeding. The Company has not had material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant
amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. The Company is required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives
of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the clinical testing and manufacturing and sale of pharmaceutical products. 

In December 2014, the Company effected a one-for-one
hundred reverse stock split of its Common Stock (the  1:100 Reverse Stock Split ) which decreased the number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding from approximately 182.0 million shares to approximately 1.82 million shares. Unless otherwise
noted, all share amounts listed in this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted for the 1:100 Reverse Stock Split as if
such stock split occurred prior to the issuance of such shares. Impacted amounts include but are not limited to shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding, stock options, shares reserved, exercise prices of warrants or options, and loss per share. There
was no impact on preferred or Common Stock authorized resulting from the 1:100 Reverse Stock Split. 

The Company developed NARCAN  (naloxone
hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, a treatment to reverse opioid overdoses, which was conceived, licensed, developed, approved by the
FDA and commercialized in less than three years. The Company plans to replicate this relatively low cost, successful business strategy
primarily through developing nasal opioid antagonists in the field of developing pharmacological treatments for substance use,
addictive, and eating disorders. The Company aims to identify and progress drug development opportunities with the potential to
file additional New Drug Applications ( NDA ) with the FDA within three years. The Company also plans to identify and
progress drug development opportunities with potentially larger markets, potentially larger addressable patient populations and
greater revenue potential. In addition, the Company plans to invest in long-term development opportunities by identifying early
stage product candidates with novel modes of action. 

The Company s current pipeline of
product candidates includes a treatment for Binge Eating Disorder ( BED ), a treatment for Bulimia Nervosa ( BN ),
a treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder ( CocUD ) and a heroin vaccine. The Company also is focused on other treatment
opportunities. 

Principal Products or Services and Markets  

Opioid Overdose Reversal  

Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the
overdose of prescription and illicit opioids and that historically has been available through injection. The Company s intranasal
delivery system of naloxone could widely expand its availability and use in preventing opioid overdose deaths. 

On April 16, 2013, the Company entered into
an agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Potomac Construction Limited ( Potomac ), in the amount
of $600,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of a product relating to the Company s treatment
to reverse opioid overdoses (the  Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product ). In exchange for this funding, the Company
agreed to provide the investor with a 6.0% interest (the  6.0% Investor Interest ) in the  OORT Net Profit 
generated from the product in perpetuity.  OORT Net Profit  is defined as any pre-tax profits received by the Company
that was derived from the sale of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product less any and all expenses incurred by and payments
made by the Company in connection with the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, including but not limited to an allocation
of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to product-related activities,
which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. The investor also has rights with respect to the 6.0% Investor
Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product is not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months, the investor will have a 60 day option
to exchange its 6.0% Investor Interest for 75,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the
Company recognized $600,000 as revenue because the investor s option to receive the shares of Common Stock expired unexercised,
and the research and development work related to the product was completed as of July 31, 2015. 

On May 30,
2013, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling
$150,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In
exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the  2013 1.5% Investor
Interest ) in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The
investor also has rights with respect to the 2013 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is
sold or the Company is sold.     If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product was not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months of the date of the agreement,
the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange its 2013 1.5% Investor Interest for 18,750 shares of Common Stock of
the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company recognized $150,000 as revenue because the investor s
option to receive the shares of Common Stock expired unexercised, and the research and development work related to the
Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2015.  

On March 14, 2014, the Company filed U.S. Provisional
Application No. 61/953,379. This application addresses delivery devices and methods of treating opioid overdoses through the administration
of intranasal naloxone. 

On May 15, 2014, the Company entered into an
agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Ernst Welmers, in the amount of $300,000 for use by the Company for
any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the  2014 1.5%
Investor Interest ) in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The
investor also has rights with respect to the 2014 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold
or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not approved by the FDA by May 15, 2016, the investor
would have had a 60 day option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for 37,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The
Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015, and, as a result, the investor did not
realize the option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended
July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $300,000 as revenue because the investor s option to receive the shares of Common Stock
was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed
as of July 31, 2016. 

On July 9, 2014, the Company filed U.S. Provisional
Application No. 62/022,268 with respect to the Company s treating opioid overdoses through the administration of intranasal
naloxone. 

On July 22, 2014, the Company received a
$3,000,000 commitment from a foundation (the  Foundation ) which later assigned its interest to Valour Fund, LLC ( Valour ), from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the Foundation for the
research, development, marketing, commercialization and any other activities connected to the Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product, certain operating expenses and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the Foundation. In exchange
for funds invested by the Foundation, Valour currently owns a  6.0% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the  6.0% Fund
Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. Valour also has rights with
respect to the 6.0% Fund Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold.
Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 6.0% Fund Interest within 2.5 years or after 2.5 years of
the July 22, 2014 initial investment date at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount
represented by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not approved by the FDA
or an equivalent body in Europe for marketing and was not actually marketed by July 22, 2016, the Foundation would have had a
60 day option to receive shares of the Company s Common Stock in lieu of the 6.0% Fund Interest in the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product at an exchange rate of 10 shares for every dollar of its investment. On July 28, 2014, the Company
received an initial investment of $111,470 from the Foundation in exchange for a 0.22294% interest. On August 13, 2014,
September 8, 2014, November 13, 2014 and February 17, 2015, the Company made capital calls of $422,344, $444,530, $1,033,614
and $988,042, respectively, from the Foundation in exchange for 0.844687%, 0.888906%, 2.067228% and 1.976085% interests,
respectively, in the OORT Net Profit. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18,
2015, and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange its 6.0% Fund Interest for shares of Common Stock
of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $3,000,000 as revenue because the option to
receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016. 

On September 9, 2014, the Company entered into
an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $500,000
for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.98% interest
in the OORT Net Profit (the  September 2014 0.98% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 0.98% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the September 2014
0.98% Investor Interest (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the September 9, 2014 initial
investment date, at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests
to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and not approved by the FDA
or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed within 24 months of the September 9, 2014 initial investment date, the investor
would have had a 60 day option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.
The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015 and, as a result, the investor did
not realize the option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the
year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $500,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was
not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as
of July 31, 2016. 

On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into
an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $500,000
for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.98% interest
in the OORT Net Profit (the  October 2014 0.98% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.98% interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the October 2014 0.98% Investor
Interest from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the October 31, 2014
investment date at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests
to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and was not approved by the
FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed by October 31, 2016, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange
its October 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product
was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015 and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange its October
2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized
$500,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development
work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016. 

On December 15, 2014, the Company and
Adapt entered into a license agreement (the  Adapt Agreement ). The Adapt Agreement has no set duration but may
be terminated, among other ways, by Adapt in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more
countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to the Company. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, Adapt received from
the Company a global license to develop and commercialize the Company s intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product. In exchange for licensing its treatment to Adapt, the Company could receive total potential regulatory and
sales milestone payments of more than $55 million, plus up to double-digit percentage royalties on net sales. The Adapt
Agreement provided for an upfront and nonrefundable payment of $500,000, and monthly payments for up to one year for
participation in joint development committee calls and the production and submission of an initial development plan. The
Adapt Agreement also required the Company to contribute $2,500,000 of development, regulatory, and commercialization costs,
some of which was credited for costs incurred by the Company prior to the execution of the Adapt Agreement. The Company
fulfilled its requirement to contribute $2,500,000 during the three months ended October 31, 2015. Upon termination of the
Adapt Agreement, (i) all rights granted by the Company thereunder shall immediately terminate; (ii) Adapt shall grant the
Company an exclusive license, with the right to grant multiple tiers of sublicenses, under the  Adapt Applied

On February 17, 2015, the Company announced
that Adapt received  Fast Track  designation by the FDA. 

On April 22, 2015, the Company announced that
Adapt successfully completed a pharmacokinetic study of intranasal naloxone. This study had been designed and conducted by the
Company in collaboration with NIDA. The pharmacokinetic study compared intranasal naloxone with an injectable formulation of naloxone.
The study met its objectives and demonstrated the intranasal formulation of naloxone delivered the targeted naloxone dose as expected.  

On June 3, 2015, the Company announced that
Adapt commenced a rolling submission of a NDA to the FDA for a nasal spray formulation of naloxone. A rolling submission allows
completed portions of the NDA to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. 

On July 29, 2015, the Company announced that
Adapt submitted a NDA to the FDA for NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, an investigational drug intended to treat
opioid overdose. 

On November 18, 2015, the FDA approved NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, to be marketed by Adapt. 

On December 8,
2015, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, to receive $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose,
which $500,000 was invested by December 18, 2015. In exchange for this funding, the Company granted the investor a 0.75% interest
in the OORT Net Profit (the  0.75% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product
in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.75% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product is sold or the Company is sold.     Additionally, the Company may buy back,
in whole or in part, the 0.75% Investor Interest, from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later
than four years, of the December 8, 2015 initial investment date, at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant
investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. Such buyback can be for a portion of the 0.75% Investor Interest
rather than for the entire interest. The investor also had an option to invest an additional $1,000,000 by February 29, 2016 for
use by the Company for any purpose in exchange for a 1.50% interest in the OORT Net Profit. If such investment were made, then
the investor also would have rights with respect to its 1.50% interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was sold
or the Company was sold. This investor option expired unexercised. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $500,000 as
revenue because the investment did not contain any option to exchange the 0.75% Investor Interest for shares of Common Stock of
the Company, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of
July 31, 2016.  

On December 15, 2015, the Company announced
that it received a $2 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the FDA approval of NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. 

On January 19, 2016, the Company announced
that Adapt announced that it has reached an agreement to facilitate the purchase of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal
Spray by offering its discounted public interest price to 62,000 agencies in state and local government and the non-profit sector.
Adapt, in partnership with the National Association of Counties, National Governors Association, National League of Cities, and
United States Conference of Mayors, will offer NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray at a discounted public interest
price of $37.50 per dose ($75 for a 2 pack carton) through the U.S. Communities Purchasing Alliance and Premier, Inc. Adapt s
discounted public interest price has been available to qualifying group purchasers, such as law enforcement, firefighters, first
responders, departments of health, local school districts, colleges and universities and community-based organizations. 

On January 27, 2016, the Company announced
that Adapt announced two national programs at the Clinton Health Matters Initiative Activation Summit to assist in efforts to address
the growing risk of opioid overdose among American high school students. Adapt offered a free carton of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray to all high schools in the U.S. through the state departments of education. This program will collaborate with the
Clinton Health Matters Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, as part of its work to scale naloxone access efforts
nationally. In addition, Adapt has provided a grant to the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) to support their educational
efforts concerning opioid overdose education materials. 

On March 7, 2016, the Company announced the
receipt of a $2.5 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the first commercial sale of NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S. 

On April 29, 2016, the Company received $105,097
in royalty payments due from Adapt from commercial sales of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S during
the first quarter of Adapt s fiscal year. 

On August 8, 2016, the Company received $234,498
in royalty payments due from Adapt from commercial sales of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S during
the second quarter of Adapt s fiscal year. 

On May 6, 2016, the Company announced that
Adapt submitted a new drug submission (NDS) for NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray to Health Canada. 

On September 15, 2016, the Company and
Adapt received notice from TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ( TEVA ), pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   355(j)(2)(B)(ii) (the
 Notice Letter ), that TEVA had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) with the FDA seeking
regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of U.S.
Patent No. 9,211,253 (the   253 patent ). The  253 patent is listed with respect to NARCAN  (naloxone
hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the FDA s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalents Evaluation publication (commonly
referred to as the  Orange Book ) and expires on March 16, 2035. TEVA s Notice Letter asserts that its generic
product will not infringe the  253 patent or that the  253 patent is invalid or unenforceable. The Company and Adapt
have been evaluating TEVA s Notice Letter. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related
to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will be vigorously defended from any
infringement. The Company may receive additional Notice Letters from other companies seeking to market generic versions of NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the future and, after evaluation, the Company may commence patent infringement lawsuits
against such companies. 

On October 5, 2016, the Company announced that
Health Canada approved Adapt s naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to treat opioid overdose, to be marketed as NARCAN 
Nasal Spray. 

On October 21, 2016, Adapt, Adapt Pharma
Operations Limited and the Company (collectively, the  Plaintiffs ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against
TEVA and TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (collectively, the  Defendants ) in the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey arising from TEVA s U.S. s filing of the ANDA with the FDA. The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief,
an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDA be a date later than the expiration of the  253 patent, as well
as equitable relief enjoining the Defendants from infringing the  253 patent and monetary relief as a result of any such
infringement. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. 

On October 27, 2016, the Company announced
that its patent for NARCAN  Nasal Spray is now listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence
Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, patent number 9468747. 

Binge Eating Disorder  

The Company is developing a treatment for BED.
BED is defined in the American Psychiatric Association s ( APA ) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) chapter on feeding and eating disorders as a diagnosis for individuals who experience
persistent, recurrent episodes of overeating, marked by loss of control and significant clinical distress. DSM-5 is used by clinicians
and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment and research. 

BED is the most common eating disorder in the
U.S. Approximately 8 million Americans are diagnosed with BED and it is correlated with obesity. In addition, according to the
APA, BED is associated with significant physical and psychological problems.  

In 2015, Shire PLC received
FDA approval to use Vyvanse to treat BED in adults. The Company considers naloxone to be a potentially compelling drug for the
pharmacological treatment of BED. It has a well-known safety profile and has the potential to block the reward that patients experience
from bingeing. 

On May 23, 2013, the Company presented the
results of the Company s Phase II clinical trial of its nasal spray treatment for BED at the APA Annual Meeting in San Francisco. 

On December 17, 2013, the Company entered into
an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling $250,000 for use by the Company for
any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.5% interest in the Company s
BED treatment product (the  BED Treatment Product ) and pay the investor 0.5% of the BED Net Profit in perpetuity (the
 2013 0.5% Investor Interest ).  BED Net Profit  is defined as the pre-tax profit generated from the BED
Treatment Product after the deduction of all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the BED Treatment
Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead. If the BED Treatment Product is not approved by the FDA
by December 17, 2016, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its entire 0.5% Investor Interest for 31,250 shares of
Common Stock of the Company. 

On September
17, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding totaling $500,000
for use by the Company for any purpose.     In exchange for this funding, the Company
agreed to provide the investor with a 1.0% interest in the Company s BED Treatment Product and pay the investor 1.0% of the
BED Net Profit generated from the BED Treatment Product in perpetuity (the  1.0% Investor Interest ). If the BED Treatment
Product is not approved by the FDA by September 17, 2017, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its entire 1.0% Investor
Interest for 62,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company.  

On July 20, 2015, the Company entered into
an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $250,000
for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.50% interest
in the BED Net Profit (the  2015 0.5% Investor Interest ) generated from the BED Treatment Product in perpetuity. The
investor also has rights with respect to the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest if the BED Treatment Product is sold or the Company is
sold. If the product is not introduced to the market and not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed
by July 20, 2018, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest for 25,000 shares of Common
Stock of the Company. 

The Company now aims to collaborate with other parties and progress
its drug development program for BED and plans to initiate a BED study in the first half of 2017. 

Bulimia Nervosa  

Bulimia Nervosa ( BN ) is an eating
disorder characterized by binging and purging, and is most common in young women. BN is thought to be significantly under-recognized.
According to Hudson, JI, Hirpi, E, Pope, HG, et al. (The Prevalence and Correlates of Eating Disorders in National Comorbidity
Survey Replication. Biol Psychiatry. 2 7;61:348-358), in the U.S., the lifetime prevalence of BN is 1% to 2%. Patients with
BN have a 94.5% comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses. For example, approximately 50% have major depressive episodes, and
33.7% engage in substance abuse. In extreme cases patients can develop life-threatening complications such as acute pancreatitis
from repeat purging. 

The only medication currently approved for
BN is Prozac (fluoxetine). Only with a high dose do patients have a reduction in binge eating of 67% and vomiting of 56%. Only
50% of patients respond to this treatment. 

The Company plans to evaluate the use of a
nasal opioid antagonist to treat this condition. The Company aims to initiate a study before Q2 2017. 

Cocaine Use Disorder  

The Company has been conducting pilot studies
to explore the potential of a nasal opioid antagonist as a treatment for CocUD. There are approximately 1.5 million current
cocaine users in the U.S., as reported by The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). There are no
FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for CocUD. 

Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant
that increases levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in brain circuits regulating pleasure and movement, with the opioid system
strongly linked to the dopamine reward circuitry. The extraordinary cost of cocaine addiction, financially, medically and socially,
is directly related to relapse: up to 80% of addicted individuals relapse within six months of treatment. 

On December 23, 2015, the Company announced
that an opioid antagonist drug will be tested in patients with CocUD at the University of Pennsylvania. The study has been conducted
by the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and began recruitment in
December 2015. Funded by a Medications Development Centers of Excellence Cooperative (U54) Program from NIDA, the study uses functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to better understand the impact of an opioid antagonist drug in the brain of patients with CocUD.
Using an opioid antagonist and blocking the downstream release of dopamine through blocking the release of endorphins may reduce
the reward patients receive from cocaine use. 

Heroin Vaccine  

Opioid addiction is a major global health issue,
particularly in the U.S., where opioid painkiller abuse and subsequent addiction has become widespread and driven the increase
in prevalence. As these painkillers have become more expensive, undergone tighter controls for distribution, and abuse deterrent
formulations have become available, there has been an increase in heroin use, which is cheaper and often easier to obtain than
painkillers. 

Current FDA-approved treatments for heroin
addiction are based on methadone-based and buprenorphine-based substitution therapies, and the use of naltrexone depot injections.
With respect to these substitution therapies, patients still take opioid-based treatments, which for many is undesirable, and there
is frequently diversion and misuse of these treatments amongst addicts. With respect to naltrexone depot injections, patients must
undergo detoxification before initiating treatment, which for several patients severely limits compliance and willingness to undergo
this method of treatment. Therefore, being able to provide a vaccine to patients that potentially provides specific immunity against
heroin and its metabolites without the need for prior detoxification and enabling patients to remain opioid-free is an attractive
solution. 

In October 2016, the Company in-licensed a heroin vaccine from
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research ( Walter Reed ). This is an early stage pre-clinical asset, based on adjuvant
technology, and requires further pre-clinical research before human testing. The Company plans to work alongside Walter Reed scientists
to advance the program into the clinic and to determine whether the product is viable in a heroin addict population. 

Other Activities  

On December 1, 2014, the Company and Aegis
Therapeutics, LLC ( Aegis ), entered into a Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the  Aegis
Agreement ) that provides the Company with an exclusive royalty-free research license for a period of time to Aegis 
proprietary delivery enhancement and stabilization agents, including Aegis  ProTek  and Intravail  technologies (collectively,
the  Technology ) to enable the Company to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology
(the  Study ). During this period of time, the Company may also evaluate its interest in having an exclusive license
to the Technology for use with opioid antagonists to treat, diagnose, predict, detect or prevent any disease, disorder, state,
condition or malady in humans (the  Possible License ). Aegis has granted the Company an exclusive option to obtain
the Possible License for a certain period after the study is completed. In consideration of the license granted to the Company
pursuant to the Aegis Agreement, the Company is required to pay to Aegis a nonrefundable study fee. 

On October 6, 2015, the Company entered into
an amendment to the Aegis Agreement. This amendment had an effective date of May 19, 2015 and allowed the Company to evaluate the
Technology through August 17, 2015. The amendment also provided an opportunity for the Company to elect to further extend the period
of time during which the Company could evaluate the Technology through February 13, 2016. In exchange for electing to further extend
this period of time, the Company paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 13,697 shares of the Company s Common Stock. The shares issued
in this transaction were using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,152. During February 2016, the Company elected
to further extend the period of time during which the Company could evaluate Aegis  Technology through August 11, 2016. During
February 2016, the Company paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 10,746 shares of the Company s Common Stock. The shares issued in
this transaction were using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,385. On April 26, 2016, the Company entered into
the Restated Aegis Agreement. 

On
September 22, 2015, the Company received a $1,600,000 commitment from the Foundation which later assigned its interest to
Valour, from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the Foundation for the research, development, any
other activities connected to the Company s opioid antagonist treatments for addictions and related disorders that
materially rely on certain studies funded by the Foundation s investment, excluding the Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product (the  Certain Studies Products ), certain operating expenses, and any other purpose consistent
with the goals of the Foundation.     In exchange for funds invested by the
Foundation, Valour currently owns a 2.1333% interest in the Certain Studies Products Net Profit (the  2.1333% Interest ). The  Certain Studies Net Profit  is defined as any pre-tax
revenue received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Certain Studies Products less any and all expenses
incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Certain Studies Products, including but not limited to an
allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to Certain
Studies Product-related activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. Valour also has rights
with respect to its  2.1333% Interest if the Certain Studies Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the
Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 2.1333% Interest from Valour within 2.5 years or after 2.5 years of the initial
investment at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to
be bought back. If an aforementioned treatment is not introduced to the market by September 22, 2018, Valour will have a 60
day option to exchange its 2.1333% Interest for shares of the Common Stock of the Company at an exchange rate of one-tenth of
a share for every dollar of its investment. On October 2, 2015, December 23, 2015, and May 28, 2016, the Company made capital
calls of $618,000, $715,500 and $266,500 from the Foundation in exchange for 0.824%, 0.954% and 0.355333% interests in
the aforementioned treatments, respectively. The Company will defer recording revenue until such time as
Valour s option expires or milestones are achieved that eliminates Valour s right to exercise the option. Upon
expiration of the exercise option, the deliverables of the arrangement will be reviewed and evaluated under Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 605. In the event Valour chooses to exchange its 2.1333% Interest, in whole or in part, for
shares of Common Stock of the Company, that transaction will be accounted for similar to a sale of shares of Common Stock for
cash.  

On April 26, 2016, the Company and Aegis entered
into the Amended and Restated Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the  Restated Aegis Agreement )
which amends and restates in its entirety the Aegis Agreement. Under the Restated Aegis Agreement, the Company has been granted
an exclusive royalty-free research license to Aegis  Technology for a period of time (the  Compound Research Period ),
to enable the Company to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology and evaluate the Company s
interest in licensing the Technology through use of a  Compound  (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) in additional
studies. 

The Company agreed to pay Aegis (i) an aggregate
of $300,000, of which the Company may elect to pay up to 50% by issuing shares of the Company s Common Stock to Aegis, with
the number of shares to be issued equal to 75% of the average closing price of the Company s Common Stock over the 20 trading
days preceding the date of payment as consideration for extending the Compound Research Period pursuant to two separate extension
payments of $150,000 each, and (ii) 50,000 shares of Common Stock as partial consideration for entering into the Restated Aegis
Agreement. The Company exercised such extensions through payment of the first and second extension fees prior to October 13, 2015
and prior to February 13, 2016, respectively. The Restated Aegis Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (i) the expiration of
the  Opiant Negotiation Periods  (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) and (ii) on 30 days  prior written
notice by the Company;  provided ,  however , that Aegis shall have the right to terminate the license granted in the
event the Company does not pursue commercially reasonable efforts to exploit a  Product , defined as (i) pharmaceutical
formulations containing the Compound as an active ingredient and (ii) Aegis s proprietary chemically synthesizable excipient(s),
including without limitation the Intravail  excipients pharmaceutical formulations containing certain ingredients of Aegis 
proprietary technology. 

During the term of the Restated Aegis
Agreement, the Company has a right of first refusal and option to add any, or all of the  Additional Compounds 
(as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement), which the Company may exercise at any time upon written notice to Aegis. The
Company has granted Aegis a co-exclusive license with the Company to use the data from the Company s Studies under the
Restated Aegis Agreement for certain purposes. Pursuant to the Restated Aegis Agreement, Aegis granted the Company an
exclusive option (the  Opiant Option ) to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license (with the right
to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers) under Aegis s interests in the Technology and any  Joint
Invention  (as such term is defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) to the Technology to research, develop, make, have
made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products containing the Compound or an Additional Compound. The Company may
exercise such Opiant Option with respect to the Compounds by written notice to Aegis within 90 days of the completion of the
Study for (i) the Compounds or (ii) the Additional Compounds. In the event the Company exercises the Opiant Option, the
parties have 120 days to negotiate and execute a definitive license agreement. The terms of such license agreement have been
contemplated and agreed upon by the parties under a letter agreement dated April 26, 2016 (the  Letter
Agreement ). In the event the Company exercises the
Opiant Option specific to the  Opioid Field  (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement), the Company shall
pay Aegis an additional $100,000 fee and any such products in the Opioid Field shall be subject to the same milestones,
royalties and other monetary obligations set forth in the Letter Agreement and summarized below. 

Under the Letter Agreement containing
the terms of such license, the Company will pay Aegis  development milestones for the Products ranging from $250,000 to
$4,000,000. Additionally, commencing on the first anniversary and through the first Product approval, the Company is required
to make minimum quarterly nonrefundable payments to Aegis in the amount of $25,000 (the  Quarterly Payments ),
which Quarterly Payments are fully creditable and treated as a prepayment against future milestones or royalties. During the
 Royalty Term  (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement), the Company shall pay Aegis royalties (the
 Royalties ) on annual net sales of Products ranging from (A) low single digits for
Products with an aggregate annual  Net Sales  (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement) during a calendar
year of $50 million or less to (B) mid-single digits for Products with Net Sales of greater than $1 billion. Such Royalties
are subject to reduction as provided in Exhibit 1 to the Restated Agreement but shall not be reduced by more than 50% of the
regularly scheduled royalty payment. 

On February 17, 2016, the Company announced
the first convening of its medical advisory board in 2016 to discuss its development programs in substance use, addictive and eating
disorders. 

Competition  

The Company faces competition from other companies focused on pharmacological
treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. Some of these companies are larger and better-funded than the Company
and there are no assurances that the Company can effectively compete with these competitors. Potential competitors include Indivior
PLC, Alkermes PLC, H. Lundbeck A/S, Shire PLC, Camurus AB, Orexo AB, BioDelivery Services International, Inc., Titan Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Cerecor Inc. In 2015, Shire PLC received FDA approval to use Vyvanse to treat BED in adults. 

With respect to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray, the Company faces competition from other treatments, including injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised
nasal kits. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. competes with NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their naloxone
injection. Kal o competes with NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their auto-injector known as EVZIO 
(naloxone HCl injection) Auto-Injector. In 2015, Indivior PLC received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA with respect to
a naloxone nasal spray. In 2016, TEVA filed an NDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of the  253 patent. Although NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray was the first FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses and has advantages over
certain other treatments, the Company expects the treatment to face additional competition. 

Research and Development  

During the years ended July 31, 2016, the Company incurred research
and development expenses of $1,747,077 and $2,414,973 respectively. 

Employees  

As of July 31, 2016, the Company had six permanent
employees, comprised of five full time employees and one part-time employee. In addition, the Company has numerous outside
consultants that are not on the Company s payroll. During the years ended July 31, 2016, the Company incurred research and
development expenses of $1,747,077 and $2,414,973 respectively. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  

Risks Related to the Company  

The Company has generated limited revenue
to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.   

The Company was incorporated on June 21, 2005.
The Company operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company which develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive
and eating disorders. The Company has generated limited revenues from inception through the date of this Annual Report. The likelihood
of the Company s future success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
often encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common
addictions and related disorders. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial delays,
poor data, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget
estimates. In order to complete certain clinical trials and otherwise operate pursuant to the Company s current business
strategy, the Company anticipates that it will incur increased operating expenses. In addition, the Company expects to incur significant
losses for the foreseeable future and the Company also expects to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as the
Company funds the Company s operating losses and capital expenditures. The Company recognizes that if the Company is unable
to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, the Company will not be able to continue operations as currently contemplated,
complete planned clinical trials or achieve profitability. The Company s failure to achieve or maintain profitability will
also negatively impact the value of the Company s securities. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to
the likelihood that the Company will prove successful. If the Company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company
will most likely fail. 

The Company s independent auditor
has issued an audit opinion for the Company which includes a statement describing the company s going concern status. The
Company s financial status creates a doubt whether the Company will continue as a going concern.   

Based on the Company s financial history
since inception, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has generated limited revenue to date. The Company has not consistently attained
profitable operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing and generating limited revenues to fund
its operations. The Company anticipates that its revenues will not be sufficient to support its current operations and additional
funding will be required in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing and/or financings from the sale of interests in
the Company s prospective products and/or royalty transactions. Despite its best efforts, the Company may not be able to
generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funding to fund the Company s operations. If the Company is unable to achieve
the foregoing, then the Company may be unable to continue operating as currently planned or to continue as a going concern. 

The Company may not succeed in completing
the development of the Company s product candidates, commercializing the Company s products, and generating significant
revenues.   

The Company s pipeline includes a
treatment for BED, a treatment for BN, a treatment for CocUD, a heroin vaccine and additional treatment applications. The Company s
products have generated limited revenues. The Company s ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability
depends on the Company s ability to successfully complete the development of its product candidates, obtain market approval,
successfully launch its products and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, the Company and Adapt entered into the
Adapt Agreement that provides Adapt with a global license to develop and commercialize the Company s intranasal naloxone
Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. The loss for any reason
of Adapt as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on the Company s business. If the Company is unable
to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize the Company s
treatment as planned and the Company may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of the treatment. 

The future success of the Company s business
cannot be determined at this time, and the Company does not anticipate generating significant revenues from product sales for the
foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expects to generate revenues from NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray, for which the Company is dependent on many factors, including the performance of the Company s licensing partner
Adapt and competition in the market. In addition, the Company has no experience in commercializing its treatments on its own and
faces a number of challenges with respect to its commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges, that: 

the Company may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the development of its
product candidates;   

the Company may not be able to manufacture its products in commercial quantities, at an adequate
quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration with third parties;   

The Company may experience delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing
or manufacturing;   

the Company may not be able to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;   

healthcare professionals and patients may not accept the Company s treatments;   

the Company may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of its products since
the Company has limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of its products;   

technological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN,
                                                                    CocUD and heroin addiction may reduce the demand for the Company s products;   

changes in the market for reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN,
                                                                    CocUD and heroin addiction, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants
                                                                    may interfere with the Company s market penetration efforts;   

third-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of
the Company s products, which may adversely affect patients  willingness to purchase the Company s products;   

uncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of the Company s products;   

the Company may face third party claims of intellectual property infringement;   

the Company may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for its products in the Company s
target markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to its products even if regulatory approval is obtained;
and   

the Company is dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to its products and the
products of its competitors. If data from a clinical trial is unfavorable, the Company would be reluctant to advance the specific
product for the indication for which it was being developed.   

If the Company is unable to meet any one or
more of these challenges successfully, the Company s ability to effectively commercialize its products could be limited,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Given the Company s lack of revenue
and cash flow, the Company will need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to the Company or, even if consummated,
may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on the Company s ability to operate.   

Since the Company may be unable to generate
sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, the Company will need to seek additional equity
or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand its operations. The Company may also need additional funding
to continue the development of its product candidates, build its sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity or develop
or acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and
general corporate purposes. 

The Company does not currently have any arrangements
or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient
additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not
available at all, the Company may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of its product candidates and other
business opportunities and its ability to achieve its business objectives, its competitiveness and its operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected. The Company s inability to fund its business could thus lead to the loss
of your investment. 

If the Company raises additional capital by
issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of the Company s existing stockholders
may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. The Company may also issue equity securities
and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of its Common Stock. Given
the Company s need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies
like the Company, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of the Company. 

Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements
that include liens on the Company s assets and covenants limiting or restricting the Company s ability to take specific
actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of the Company s
operating results. 

If the Company raises additional funds through
collaborations and licensing arrangements, the Company may be required to relinquish some rights to its products or to grant licenses
on terms that are not favorable to the Company. 

The Company s current and future
operations substantially depend on the Company s management team and the Company s ability to hire other key personnel,
the loss of any of whom could disrupt the Company s business operations.   

The Company s business depends and will
continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal and Kevin Pollack, the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The loss of the services of either of these individuals would significantly
impede implementation and execution of the Company s business strategy and may result in the failure to reach its goals.  

The Company s future viability and ability
to achieve sales and profits will also depend on the Company s ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified
personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing its operations. There is a risk that the Company will be unable to attract,
train, retain or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the Company s failure to do so may severely
damage its prospects. 

If the Company is unable to obtain and
maintain patent protection for the Company s products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained
is not sufficiently broad, the Company s competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates similar
or identical to the Company s, and the Company s ability to successfully commercialize the Company s products
and product candidates may be adversely affected.   

The Company s commercial success will
depend, in part, on the Company s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect
to the Company s products and product candidates. The Company seeks to protect the Company s proprietary position by
filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to the Company s products and product candidates that are important
to the Company s business, as appropriate. The Company cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect
to applications that are currently pending or that the Company may apply for in the future with respect to one or more of the Company s
products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable. 

The patent prosecution process is expensive
and time-consuming, and the Company may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable
cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that the Company will fail to identify patentable aspects of the Company s
research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although the Company may enter into non-disclosure
and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of the Company s research and development
output, such as the Company s employees, distribution partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these
parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing the Company s
ability to seek patent protection. 

The patent position of pharmaceutical companies
generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation.
As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of the Company s patent rights are highly
uncertain. The Company s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued,
the patents may not meaningfully protect the Company s products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and
third parties from commercializing competitive products or otherwise provide the Company with any competitive advantage. The Company s
competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent the Company s patents by developing similar or alternative products
in a non-infringing manner. 

Changes in either the patent laws, implementing
regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may also diminish the value of the Company s
patents or narrow the scope of the Company s patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect the Company s
rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and
defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. 

The Company cannot be certain that the Company s
patents and patent rights will be effective in protecting the Company s products, product candidates and technologies. Failure
to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operations, financial condition and
prospects. 

The Company may face litigation from
third parties claiming that the Company s products infringe on their intellectual property rights, or seek to challenge the
validity of the Company s patents.   

The Company s future success is also
dependent in part on the strength of the Company s intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed
from years of research and development. In addition to the litigation with TEVA discussed below, the Company may be exposed to
additional future litigation by third parties seeking to challenge the validity of the Company s rights based on claims that
the Company s technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or are invalid, or
that the Company has misappropriated the trade secrets of others. 

Since the Company s inception, the Company
has sought to contract with manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of pharmaceutical formulations and products. As a result,
the Company has disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of the Company s technology with potential manufacturers
and suppliers. The Company believes that these disclosures, while necessary for the Company s business, may have resulted
and may result in the attempt by potential manufacturers and suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to the Company s
technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing and supplier rights. 

On September 15, 2016, the Company and
Adapt received the Notice Letter from TEVA, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   355(j)(2)(B)(ii), that TEVA had filed an ANDA with the
FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration
of the  253 patent. The  253 patent is listed with respect to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the
FDA s Orange Book and expires on March 16, 2035. TEVA s Notice Letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe
the  253 patent or that the  253 patent is invalid or unenforceable. The Company and Adapt have been evaluating TEVA s
Notice Letter. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will be vigorously defended from any infringement. The Company may receive additional
Notice Letters from other companies seeking to market generic versions of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the
future and, after evaluation, the Company may commence patent infringement lawsuits against such companies. 

On October 21, 2016, Adapt, Adapt Pharma
Operations Limited and the Company (collectively, the  Plaintiffs ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against
TEVA and TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (collectively, the  Defendants ) in the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey arising from TEVA s U.S. s filing of the ANDA with the FDA. The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief,
an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDA be a date later than the expiration of the  253 patent, as well
as equitable relief enjoining the Defendants from infringing the  253 patent and monetary relief as a result of any such
infringement. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. There can be
no assurances that the Company will be successful with respect to this litigation matter. Such a failure may have a material impact
on the Company and its business operations in the future. 

The expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely
affect the Company s future revenues and operating earnings.   

The Company relies on patent, trademark, trade
secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of the Company s
products and product candidates. In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization
of the Company s products and product candidates. Patents covering the Company s products and product candidates normally
provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for the Company s products and product candidates to become profitable. 

Certain of the Company s patents
will expire in the next 18 to 21 years. While the Company is seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology
underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that
these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if the Company is successful in obtaining a patent,
patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after
it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without
patent protection for the Company s products and product candidates, the Company may be open to competition from generic
versions of such methods and devices. 

The Company may be exposed to product
liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon the Company
should the Company be sued.   

The Company s business exposes the Company
to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical
formulations and products. The Company cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against the Company. A successful liability
claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

The Company cannot give assurances that the
Company will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or
that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability
insurance coverage that the Company may obtain could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

The Company s products may have
undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off
the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.   

Unforeseen side effects from the Company s
products and product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the Company s products
have been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the Company s products to be harder
and more costly to obtain. 

To date, no serious adverse events have been
attributed to the Company s products and product candidates. The results of the Company s planned or any future clinical
trials may show that the Company s products and product candidates causes undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which
could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and
other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label
warnings. If the Company s product candidates receive marketing approval and the Company or others later identify undesirable
or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of the Company s products: 

regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force the Company
to remove its products from the market;   

regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication,
or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies and others;   

the Company may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered,
conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the products;   

the Company may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;   

sales of the products may decrease significantly;   

the Company may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and   

the Company s reputation may suffer.   

Any of these events could prevent the Company
or its potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the Company s products or could
substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent the Company from generating significant
revenues from the sale of its products. 

The Company currently has no marketing
and sales organization and has no experience marketing pharmaceutical products. If the Company is unable to establish its own marketing
and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell the Company s products after approval,
the Company may not be able to generate product revenues.   

The Company does not have a sales organization
for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize the Company s products
or any other product candidates the Company may develop or acquire in the future, the Company must develop these capabilities on
its own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of its products. The establishment and
development of the Company s own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and
the Company cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, the Company may seek
one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales, marketing and distribution of its products. There also may be certain
markets within the U.S. and elsewhere for the Company s products for which the Company may seek a co-promotion arrangement.
However, the Company may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell its products on favorable terms, or
at all. In the event the Company is unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing
and sales organization, the Company will not be able to commercialize its products or any other product candidates that it develops,
which will negatively impact its ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether the Company commercializes products
on its own or relies on a third party to do so, the Company s ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness
of the sales force. In addition, to the extent the Company relies on third parties to commercialize its approved products, the
Company would likely receive less revenues than if the Company commercialized these products itself. 

The market for the Company s products
is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair the Company s ability
to maintain and grow the Company s business and remain competitive.   

The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid
and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render the Company s technologies and products noncompetitive
or obsolete. The Company also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological
competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying
into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development
capabilities and budgets than the Company does, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial
resources. These entities represent significant competition for the Company. 

The Company s reliance on collaborations
with third parties to develop and commercialize the Company s products, such as the Adapt Agreement to develop and commercialize
the Company s intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, is subject to inherent risks and may result
in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting the Company s ability to commercialize the Company s
products and adversely affecting the Company s profitability.   

With respect to the products the Company has
licensed, the Company depends upon collaborations with third parties to develop these product candidates and the Company depends
substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, the Company s ability to develop, obtain
regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize the Company s existing and possibly future product candidates depends
upon the Company s ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements
with others. The Company also engages, and intends in the future to continue to engage, contract manufacturers and clinical trial
investigators. 

In addition, although not a primary component
of the Company s current strategy, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led the
Company in the past, and may continue to require the Company, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others,
including other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds
or product candidates would typically require the Company to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. Furthermore,
these agreements may result in the Company s revenues being lower than if the Company developed the Company s product
candidates on the Company s own and in the Company s loss of control over the development of the Company s product
candidates. 

Contractors or collaborators may have the
right to terminate their agreements with the Company or reduce their payments to the Company under those agreements on limited
or no notice and for no reason or reasons outside of the Company s control. For example, the Company may be unable to maintain
its relationship with Adapt on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, as the Adapt agreement may be terminated by Adapt in
its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice
to the Company. In addition, Adapt may have similar or more established relationships with the Company s competitors or larger
customers which may negatively impact the Company s relationship with Adapt. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt as
a key partner could have a materially significant and adverse impact on the Company s business. If the Company is unable
to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize the Company s
products as planned and the Company may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of the Company s products. The
same could apply to other product candidates the Company may develop or acquire in the future. The Company s dependence upon
third parties to assist with the development and commercialization of the Company s product candidates may adversely affect
the Company s ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and the Company s ability to develop and deliver
such products on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, the Restated Aegis Agreement expires on the earlier of (i) the expiration
of the Opiant Negotiation Periods and (ii) on 30 days  prior written notice by the Company;  provided ,  however ,
that Aegis shall have the right to terminate the license granted in the event the Company does not pursue commercially reasonable
efforts to exploit a Product. 

If the Company s current or future
licensees exercise termination rights they may have, or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory
approvals, or for other reasons, and the Company is not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations
or licensing arrangements, the Company may not be able to develop and/or commercialize the Company s product candidates.
Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements the Company may enter into may not be on terms favorable to the Company. 

A further risk the Company faces with the
Company s collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborator or their business strategy may adversely
affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to the Company. 

The Company s current or any future
collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful. The Company s agreements with collaborators typically
allows them discretion in electing whether to pursue various development, regulatory, commercialization and other activities, such
as the Adapt Agreement. 

If any collaborator were to breach its
agreement with the Company or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical
or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated. 

Other risks associated with the Company s collaborative
and contractual arrangements with others include the following: 

the Company may not have day-to-day control over the activities of the Company s contractors
or collaborators;   

the Company s collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or
technologies that are incorporated into the products the Company develops with them;   

third parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations; and   

the Company may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements;
and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary
rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.   

These factors could lead to delays in the
development of the Company s product candidates and/or the commercialization of the Company s products or reduction
in the milestone payments the Company receives from the Company s collaborators, or could result in the Company s not
being able to commercialize the Company s products. Further, disagreements with the Company s contractors or collaborators
could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. The Company s ultimate
success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If the Company fails to maintain these
relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of the Company s product candidates and/or the commercialization
of the Company s products will be delayed or may never be realized. 

The Company is exposed to product
liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon the Company, should
lawsuits be filed against the Company.   

The Company s business exposes the
Company to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing
of pharmaceutical formulations and products. The Company expects that such claims are likely to be asserted against the Company
at some point. In addition, the use in the Company s clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the
subsequent sale of these formulations or products by the Company or the Company s potential collaborators may cause the Company
to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. Any claim under any existing insurance policies or any insurance policies
secured in the future may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all,
and may not cover the full extent of liability the Company may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series
of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Security breaches and other disruptions
could compromise the Company s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause the Company s business
and reputation to suffer.   

In the ordinary course of the Company s
business, the Company collects and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, the Company s proprietary business
information and that of the Company s customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information
of the Company s customers and employees, in the Company s data centers and on the Company s networks. The secure
processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company s operations and business strategy.
Despite the Company s security measures, the Company s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable
to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise the
Company s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access,
disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy
of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company s operations and the products the Company provides
to customers, and damage the Company s reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in the Company s products, which
could adversely affect the Company s business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position. 

Risks Related to Government Regulation of the Company s
Industry  

Legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system
may affect the Company s ability to sell the Company s products profitably.   

In both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have
been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the Company s
ability to sell the Company s future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,  PPACA ),
which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law,
among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products,
addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs
that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under
the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations,
and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale
discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition
for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance
also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners. 

In the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental
healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of the Company s future products, and the Company could be
adversely affected by current and future health care reforms. 

The Company s industry and the Company are subject
to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where the Company s
products are and product candidates may be sold.   

Both before and after regulatory approval to market a particular
product candidate, including the Company s product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting,
storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory
requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration,
as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ) requirements and good clinical practice
requirements for any clinical trials that the Company conduct post-approval. As a result, the Company is subject to a number
of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include: 

clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at
any stage of the Company s clinical trials;   

the Company s clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals;
the Company does not know whether the Company s planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule,
or at all;   

the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place
a clinical trial on hold;   

the Company relies on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical
institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for the Company s drug candidates and if the Company
or any of the Company s third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGCP requirements,
the clinical data generated in the Company s clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines
Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require the Company to perform additional clinical trials;   

if the clinical development process is completed successfully, the Company s ability to derive
revenues from the sale of the Company s product candidates will depend on the Company s first obtaining FDA or other
comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;   

there is no assurance that the Company will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of
the Company s product candidates for any indication; the Company is subject to government regulation for the commercialization
of the Company s product candidates;   

the Company has not received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the commercial sale of any of
the Company s product candidates;   

even if one or more of the Company s product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory
authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than the Company requests, may not approve
the price the Company intends to charge for the Company s products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly
post-marketing clinical trials or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for
the successful commercialization of that product candidate;   

undesirable side effects caused by the Company s product candidates could cause the Company
or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay
or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;   

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated
severity or frequency, or with the Company s third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with
the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities could subject the Company to administrative
or judicially imposed sanctions;   

the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent,
limit or delay regulatory approval of the Company s drug candidates, and if the Company is slow or unable to adapt to changes
in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if the Company is not able to maintain regulatory
compliance, the Company may lose any marketing approval that the Company may have obtained; and   

the Company may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in
the operations of the Company s business.   

In addition, the Company s operations
are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including,
without limitation: 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully
soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable
under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical
manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person
or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;   

Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower
or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be present, claims for payment or approval
to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or
transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing
an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including
items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes
of the false claims statutes;   

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) and its implementing
regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare
benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;   

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also
imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable
health information;   

Federal  sunshine  requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding
any  transfer of value  made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment
interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in
civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for  knowing
failures ), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission,
and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and   

State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and
false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state
laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance
guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws
that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other
healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information,
many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.   

Risks Related to the Company s Common Stock  

The trading in the Company s
shares is regulated by Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission  or the  SEC ) and is subject
to the  Penny Stock  rules. These rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in the Company s stock
and provide an illiquid market for the Company s securities.   

Although the Company s shares are
currently traded at a price higher than $5.00, the Company s shares have frequently traded in the past at a price lower than
$5.00. If the Company s share price goes below $5.00, the shares will be defined as a  Penny Stock  under the
Exchange Act and rules of the Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than
securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer,
prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document
that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer
with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction
and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The broker-dealer
must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens
imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the Company s
securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of the Company s securities. These requirements may
restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company s Common Stock and may affect your ability to resell the Company s
Common Stock. 

The Company will incur ongoing costs and
expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without revenue, the Company may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult
for investors to sell their shares, if at all. 

The Company s shares are quoted on
the OTCQB Market under the symbol  OPNT.  To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings
with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance, the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings,
which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain
in compliance, it may be difficult for the Company s stockholders to resell any shares, if at all. 

The price of the Company s Common Stock could be
highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.   

The Company s Common Stock is listed
on the OTCQB Market under the symbol  OPNT.  The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical companies
in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
The trading price of the Company s Common Stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly
volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following: 

limited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;   

fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be
tied to the financial performance of the Company;   

performance by the Company in the execution of its business plan;   

financial viability;   

actual or anticipated variations in the Company s operating results;   

announcements of developments by the Company or the Company s competitors;   

market conditions in the Company s industry; 

announcements by the Company or the Company s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic
partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;   

adoption of new accounting standards affecting the Company s industry; 

additions or departures of key personnel;   

introduction of new products by the Company or the Company s competitors; 

sales of the Company s Common Stock or other securities in the open market;   

regulatory developments in both the U.S. and foreign countries; 

performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;   

economic and other external factors; 

period-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and;   

other events or factors, including the other factors described in this  Risk
Factors  section. 

The Company does not anticipate declaring
any cash dividends on the Company s Common Stock.   

The Company currently intends to retain
any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of the Company s business. Accordingly, the Company does not expect
to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy from time to time as circumstances dictate. 

The Company may register an aggregate
of at least 15,715 shares of Common Stock, at least 45,000 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants and at least 2,000,000 shares
of Common Stock underlying options in the first half of 2017. The sales of such shares could depress the market price of the Company s
Common Stock.   

The Company may register an aggregate of
at least 15,715 shares of Common Stock, at least 45,000 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants and at least 2,000,000 shares
of Common Stock underlying options under a registration statement on Form S-1 in the first half of 2017. Assuming 2,060,715 total
shares were registered, it would represent approximately 101.94% of the Company s shares of Common Stock outstanding held
by non-affiliates as of October 17, 2016, assuming that all the security holders exercised all of their warrants and options. The
sale of these shares into the public market could depress the market price of the Company s Common Stock. 

Certain of the Company s executive officers and
directors control the direction of the Company s business by means of a significant collective ownership of the Company s
common stock. The concentrated beneficial ownership of the Company s common stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing
significant corporate decisions.   

Dr. Roger Crystal, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and a director, Kevin Pollack, the Company s Chief Financial Officer and a director, Dr. Michael
Sinclair, the Company s Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board )
and Geoffrey Wolf, a director, collectively beneficially own approximately 70.63% of the Company s outstanding
common stock as of October 17, 2016. As a result, such executive officers and directors effectively control the Company and have
the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by the Company s stockholders, including the
election and removal of directors, amendments to the Company s Articles of Incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership
could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from such executive officers and directors. 

As an  emerging growth company 
under applicable law, the Company is subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave the Company s stockholders
without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.   

For as long as the Company remains an  emerging
growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the  JOBS
Act ), the Company has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to: 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act );   

taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;   

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company s periodic
reports and proxy statements; and   

exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.   

The Company expects to take advantage of
these reporting exemptions until the Company is no longer an  emerging growth company.  Because of these lessened regulatory
requirements, the Company s stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature
companies. 

Because the Company has elected to
use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an  emerging growth company, 
its financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.   

The Company has elected to use the extended
transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election
allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public
and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, the Company s financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and thus investors may have difficulty
evaluating or comparing the Company s business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may
have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of the Company s Common Stock. 

The Company will incur ongoing costs
and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without significant revenue the Company may not be able to remain in compliance,
making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.   

The Company s shares are quoted on
the OTCQB Market under the symbol  OPNT . To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings
with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance, the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings,
which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain
in compliance it may be difficult for the Company s stockholders to resell any shares, if at all. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.  

This information is not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 2.  Properties.  

The Company does not currently own any
physical property. 

The Company s headquarters are located
on the 12 th  Floor of 401 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica, CA 90401and are leased for $5,056 per month. The lease with Premier
Office Centers, LLC ( Premier ), as amended effective October 1, 2016, has an initial term of five months and shall
automatically renew for successive six month periods unless terminated by the Company in writing 60 days prior to the termination
date. Premier may terminate the lease for any reason upon 30 days  prior notice to the Company. 

The Company also leases office space in
Suite 100 of 1180 North Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89144 for $299 per month. This lease, with Regus Management Group, LLC,
expires on July 31, 2017. 

Additionally, the Company leases office
space in Euston Tower, L32 to L34, 286 Euston Road, London, England, NW1 3DP for a total of  1,932 for the initial five month
term ending March 31, 2017. The Company s lease is with Euston Tower Serviced Offices Ltd. 

The Company currently has no investment
policies as they pertain to real estate, real estate interests, or real estate mortgages. 

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.  

On September 15, 2016, the Company and
Adapt received the Notice Letter from TEVA, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   355(j)(2)(B)(ii), that TEVA had filed an ANDA with the
FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration
of the  253 patent. The  253 patent is listed with respect to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the
FDA s Orange Book and expires on March 16, 2035. TEVA s Notice Letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe
the  253 patent or that the  253 patent is invalid or unenforceable. The Company and Adapt have been evaluating TEVA s
Notice Letter. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will be vigorously defended from any infringement. The Company may receive additional
Notice Letters from other companies seeking to market generic versions of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the
future and, after evaluation, the Company may commence patent infringement lawsuits against such companies. 

On October 21, 2016, Adapt, Adapt Pharma
Operations Limited and the Company (collectively, the  Plaintiffs ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against
TEVA and TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (collectively, the  Defendants ) in the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey arising from TEVA s U.S. s filing of the ANDA with the FDA. The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief,
an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDA be a date later than the expiration of the  253 patent, as well
as equitable relief enjoining the Defendants from infringing the  253 patent and monetary relief as a result of any such
infringement. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride)
Nasal Spray and expects that the  253 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. There can be
no assurances that the Company will be successful with respect to this litigation matter. Such a failure may have a material impact
on the Company and its business operations in the future. 

Except as described above, the Company
is currently not involved in any litigation that the Company believes could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court,
public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or other body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers
of the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, the Company s Common
Stock, any of the Company s subsidiaries or the Company s or the Company s subsidiaries  officers or directors
in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.  

Not applicable. 

PART II  

Item 5.  Market for Registrant s
Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.  

Market Information  

From April 2007 through January 2016, the
Company s Common Stock was listed for quotation on the OTCQB under the symbol  LLTP . Beginning in February 2016,
following the Company s name change to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company s Common Stock has been listed for
quotation on the OTCQB under the symbol  OPNT . 

Price Range of Common Stock  

The following table shows, for the periods
indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of the Company s Common Stock as reported by the OTCQB quotation service.
The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commissions, and may not necessarily represent
actual transactions. 

Approximate Number of Equity Security Holders  

As of October 17, 2016, there were approximately
148 stockholders of record. Because shares of the Company s Common Stock are held by depositaries, brokers and other
nominees, the number of beneficial holders of the Company s shares is substantially larger than the number of stockholders
of record. 

Dividends  

There are no restrictions in the Company s
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws that prevent the Company from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes,
however, do prohibit the Company from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 

1.  
      the Company would not be able to pay the Company s debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or   

2.  
      the Company s total assets would be less than the sum of the Company s total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of stockholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.   

The Company has never declared any dividends,
and the Company does not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities  

Stock Options     

On
October 27, 2015, the Company granted options to purchase 250,000, 500,000, 500,000 and 62,500 shares of Common Stock
exercisable on a cashless basis to Dr. Michael Sinclair, Dr. Roger Crystal, Mr. Kevin Pollack and Mr. Geoffrey Wolf,
respectively, and the Company also granted options to purchase 125,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable on a cashless basis
to Arvind Agrawal, a senior executive of the Company. Each of these options have an exercise price of $7.25, a term of 10
years and vested immediately upon grant. Each stock option may only be exercised between the following dates: (i) the first
to occur of: (A) the commencement of three trials on or subsequent to October 23, 2015  or (B) (1) the approval by the
FDA of the NDA with respect to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, and (2) the commencement of two trials on or
subsequent to October 23, 2015  and (ii) the expiration date. As of April 30, 2016, the conditions for exercisability
were met and the options were fully exercisable. The Company has valued these options using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, resulting in a fair market value of an aggregate of $10,062,500, which options have been fully recognized as an
expense for the year ended July 31, 2016.  

On
May 17, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 35,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable on a cashless
basis to each of the then-new members of the Company s Board, Ms. Ann MacDougall and Dr. Gabrielle Silver. These
options all have an exercise price of $10.00 and a term of 5 years. The options for each new director vest as follows: 11,667
shares vest upon the uplisting of the Company to the NASDAQ Stock Market; 11,667 shares vest upon the cumulative funding of
the Company of or in excess of $5,000,000 by institutional investors commencing May 5, 2016; and 11,666 shares vest upon
the first submission of a NDA to the FDA for one of the Company s products by either the Company or a Company licensee.
The Company has valued these options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which resulted in an aggregate fair
market value of $580,286, of which an aggregate of $149,007 was recognized as expense for the year ended July 31,
2016.  

These
options to purchase shares of Common Stock were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. These
shares of the Company s Common Stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) since the issuance shares by the Company
did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a  public offering  as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial
number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. The Company
did not undertake an offering in which the Company sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, the
investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) because they agreed to and received share certificates
bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that
these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a  public offering. 
Based on an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act for this transaction.  

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans  

The Company does
not have in effect any compensation plans under which the Company s equity securities are authorized for issuance.  

Item 6. Selected
Financial Data.  

The Company is not required to provide
the information required by this Item because the Company is a smaller reporting company.  

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016
and 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  contained
in Part 1 of this Annual Report, the  Risk Factors  contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report, our financial statements
and the notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report, and the other information appearing elsewhere in, or incorporated
by reference into, this Annual Report.   

Overview  

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company
which develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. 

Our strategy is to develop pharmacological
treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders based on the Company s expertise using opioid antagonists. The
Company has worked on developing a treatment for reversing opioid overdoses in collaboration with the NIDA, part of the NIH. This
treatment, now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, was approved by the FDA in November 2015, and is marketed
by Adapt, an Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. 

The Company has not consistently attained
profitable operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund its operations. The Company anticipates
if revenues are not sufficient then additional funding will be required in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing from
the sale of the Company s Common Stock and/or financings from the sale of interests in the Company s prospective products
and/or royalty transactions. However, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funding to
fund the Company s operations. 

The Company has not had a bankruptcy, receivership
or similar proceeding. The Company has not had material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant
amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. The Company is required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives
of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the clinical testing and manufacturing and sale of pharmaceutical products. 

The Company developed NARCAN  (naloxone
hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, a treatment to reverse opioid overdoses, which was conceived, licensed, developed, approved by the
FDA and commercialized in less than three years. The Company plans to replicate this relatively low cost, successful business strategy
primarily through developing nasal opioid antagonists in the field of developing pharmacological treatments for substance use,
addictive, and eating disorders. The Company aims to identify and progress drug development opportunities with the potential to
file additional NDAs with the FDA within three years. The Company also plans to identify and
progress drug development opportunities with potentially larger markets, potentially larger addressable patient populations and
greater revenue potential. In addition, the Company plans to invest in long-term development opportunities by identifying early
stage product candidates with novel modes of action. 

The Company s current pipeline of
product candidates includes a treatment for BED, a treatment for BN, a treatment for CocUD and a heroin vaccine. The Company also
is focused on other treatment opportunities.  

Results of Operations  

Based on recent operational results, the
Company expects increased demand for, and competition with respect to, NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. 

The Company had $9,897,595 and $1,550,000
of revenue during the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue during the year ended July 31,
2016 was in part the result of recognizing $4,800,000 of revenue from the sale of OORT Net Profit interests. The revenue from these
sales was recognized during the year ended July 31, 2016 because either the investment did not contain an option to exchange OORT
Net Profit interests for shares of the Company s Common Stock or the product was approved by the FDA and marketed, which
negated the investor s option to exchange OORT Net Profit interests for shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the research
and development work related to the product was completed as of July 31, 2016. The Company also recognized $5,097,095 of revenue
derived from the Adapt Agreement during the year ended July 31, 2016, which included (i) $2,000,000 milestone revenue received
as a result of the FDA s approval of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray for the emergency treatment of known
or suspected opioid overdose and (ii) $2,500,000 milestone revenue received as a result of the first commercial sale of NARCAN 
(naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, both of which are milestones set forth in the Adapt Agreement. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

The Company s general and administrative
expenses were incurred in the amounts of $15,571,080 and $6,034,520 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
increase of $9,536,560 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation, as the Company recorded $10,618,365 of stock-based
compensation during the year ended July 31, 2016 as compared to $1,729,216 during the year ended July 31, 2015. This increase was
partially offset by decreases in professional fees, consulting costs, and non-stock based officer s compensation.  

Selling Expenses  

The Company s selling expenses were
incurred in the amounts of $317,917 and $0 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase was a result
of incurring selling expenses for revenue earned in 2016. The Company did not incur any selling expenses for revenue earned in
2015. 

Research and Development   

The Company spent $1,747,077 and $2,414,973
during the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to decreased spending on research
and development of the Company s Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product during the year ended July 31, 2016. This decreased
spending was offset by the Company recording $877,660 of stock-based compensation for research and development services during
the year ended July 31, 2016 compared to $0 for 2015. 

Interest Expense, net  

During the year ended July 31, 2016, interest
expense decreased to $11,890 from $28,232 during the year ended July 31, 2015. During the year ended July 31, 2016, a reduction
in debt outstanding resulted in a decrease in interest expense incurred. During the year ended July 31, 2015, a greater amount
of debt outstanding resulted in a greater amount of interest expense incurred. 

Net Loss   

The comparable net loss for the year ended
July 31, 2016, as compared to the net loss for the year ended July 31, 2015, was $7,814,256 and $7,037,873, respectively. This
increased net loss was due primarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses, particularly stock-based compensation.
This increase was offset by an increase in revenues and a decrease research and development expenses during the year ended July
31, 2016. 

The Company has not consistently attained
profitable operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund its operations. In their report
on the Company s financial statements at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, the Company s auditors raised substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company s cash balance at July
31, 2016 was $1,481,393 plus $6,586,834 of outstanding liabilities. The Company s management believes that the Company s
current cash balance is sufficient to fund the Company s current operations into the first calendar quarter of 2017. Unless
the Company raises additional capital, the Company expects to initiate certain cost-cutting measures, which are expected to fund
the Company s operations into the second calendar quarter of 2017. As a result, the Company will need to generate sufficient
revenues and/or seek additional funding in the near future. The Company currently does not have a specific plan of how it will
obtain such funding; however, the Company anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of debt financing and/or equity
financing from the sale of the Company s Common Stock and/or financings from the sale of interests in the Company s
prospective products and/or in the royalty transactions. Such funds may also be derived pursuant to the terms of the Adapt Agreement. 

During the year ended July 31, 2016, the
Company received $1,600,000 in funding from the  Foundation in exchange for Certain Studies Products Net Profit
interests as related to the Company s opioid antagonist treatments for addictions and related disorders that materially rely
on certain studies funded by the foundation s investment, excluding the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. This
investment increased the cash position of the Company. The Company expects to continue to issue debt and/or equity and/or sell
interests in the Company s prospective products and/or enter into royalty transactions to sustain the implementation of the
Company s business plan, unless sufficient revenues are generated. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company received
$4,638,530 in funding in exchange for interests in the Company s Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product and BED treatment. 

At this time, the Company cannot provide
investors with any assurance that it will be able to generate sufficient revenues and/or obtain sufficient funding from debt financing
and/or the sale of its Common Stock and/or the sale of interests in the Company s prospective products and/or royalty transactions
to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. The Company does not have any arrangements in place for any future financing.
The Company may also seek to obtain short-term loans from its officers and directors to meet its short-term funding needs. The
Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2016. 

The financial position of the Company at
the year ended July 31, 2016 showed an increase in assets from July 31, 2015 of $1,394,083 to $1,881,878, respectively. This was
due primarily to increases in the Company s cash position and accounts receivable amounts, which were the due to increased
revenues and an increase in funding during the year. The liabilities at July 31, 2016 decreased to $6,586,834 from $8,874,520 at
July 31, 2015. This decrease was partially the result of a decrease in Company s deferred revenue and accounts payable offset
by an increase in accrued salaries and wages and notes payable. 

Going Concern  

The Company s independent auditor
has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company has incurred significant losses,
a working capital deficit as of July 31, 2016 of $2,380,539 and is dependent on generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient revenues
and/or obtain the necessary funding, it could cease operations. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Plan Of Operation  

During the next year, the Company aims
to broaden the Company s product pipeline and anticipates commencing further trials based on the Company s existing
as well as potential patents. 

The Company anticipates receiving revenues
pursuant to the Adapt Agreement. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, in exchange for licensing its treatment to Adapt, the Company
could receive total potential development and sales milestone payments of more than $55 million, plus up to double-digit royalties.
On November 18, 2015, the FDA approved NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray for the emergency treatment of known or
suspected opioid overdose, to be marketed by Adapt. On December 15, 2015, the Company announced that it received a $2 million milestone
payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the FDA approval of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray.
On March 7, 2016, the Company announced the receipt of a $2.5 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was
triggered by the first commercial sale of NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S. 

The Company aims to collaborate with other parties and progress
its drug development program for BED and plans to initiate a BED study in the first half of 2017. 

The Company plans to evaluate the use of
a nasal opioid antagonist to treat BN. The Company aims to initiate a study before Q2 2017. 

The Company has focused on developing a treatment for CocUD.
On December 23, 2015, the Company announced that an opioid antagonist drug will be tested in patients with CocUD at the University
of Pennsylvania. The study has been conducted by the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University
of Pennsylvania, and began recruitment in December 2015. Funded by a Medications Development Centers of Excellence Cooperative
(U54) Program from NIDA, the study uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to better understand the impact of an opioid
antagonist drug in the brain of patients with CocUD. Using an opioid antagonist and blocking the downstream release of dopamine
through blocking the release of endorphins may reduce the reward patients receive from cocaine use. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The Company believes that the following
critical policies affect the Company s more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the Company s
financial statements. 

The Company prepares its financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. These principals require management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board; however, actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

The Company issues restricted stock to
consultants for various services and employees for compensation. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of
the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is measurable more reliably measurable.
The value of the Common Stock is measured at the earlier of: (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty
to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete. 

The Company issues options and warrants
to consultants, directors, and officers as compensation for services. These options and warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes
model, which focuses on the current stock price and the volatility of moves to predict the likelihood of future stock moves. This
method of valuation is typically used to accurately price stock options and warrants based on the price of the underlying stock. 

Long-lived assets such as property, equipment
and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the
asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent
appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an
impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are
not available, The Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the
risk associated with the recovery of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.  

Fair value estimates used in preparation
of the financial statements are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include
cash, accounts payable, note payable and due to related parties. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these
financial instruments since they are short-term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable
or payable on demand. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenues from nonrefundable,
up-front license fees related to collaboration agreements, on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of
performance. The period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and/or
development is expected to occur or manufacturing services are expected to be provided. When the period of performance is based
on the period over which research and/or development is expected to occur, the Company is required to make estimates regarding
drug development and commercialization timelines. Because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of
drug candidates, these estimates regarding the period of performance may change. 

In addition, the Company evaluates each
arrangement to determine whether or not it qualifies as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement under ASC 605-25. If one or
more of the deliverables have a standalone value, then the arrangement would be separated into multiple units of accounting. This
normally occurs when the R D services could contractually and feasibly be provided by other vendors or if the customer could
perform the remaining R D itself, and when the Company has no further obligations and the right has been conveyed. When the
deliverables cannot be separated, any initial payment received is treated like an advance payment for the services and recognized
over the performance period, as determined based on all of the items in the arrangement. This period is usually the expected research
and development period. 

The Company recognizes revenue from milestone
payments upon achievement of the milestones and when the Company has no further involvement or obligation to perform services,
as related to that specific element of the arrangement, provided the milestone is meaningful, and provided that collectability
is reasonably assured and other revenue recognition criteria are met. 

The Company recognizes revenue from royalty
revenue when the Company has fulfilled the terms of the contractual agreement and has no material future obligation, other than
inconsequential and perfunctory support, and the amount of the royalty fee is determinable and collection is reasonably assured. 

Licensing Agreement  

On December 15, 2014, the Company entered
into a licensing agreement (the  Adapt Agreement ) with Adapt Pharma Operations Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Adapt Pharma Limited ( Adapt ), an Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, the Company
provided a global license to develop and commercialize the Company s intranasal naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment,
now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. In exchange for licensing its treatment, the Company received a
nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $500,000 in December 2014. The Company also received a monthly fee for one year for participation
in joint development committee calls and the production and submission of an initial development plan. The initial development
plan was completed and submitted in May 2015. Management evaluated the deliverables of this arrangement and determined that the
licensing deliverable had a standalone value and therefore, the payments were recognized as revenue. 

The Company could also receive additional
payments upon reaching various sales and regulatory milestones as well as royalty payments for commercial sales of NARCAN generated
by Adapt. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company received $4,500,000 of milestone payments and recognized royalty revenues
of approximately $418,000 pursuant to the Adapt Agreement. 

In addition, pursuant to the Adapt Agreement,
the Company is required to contribute $2,500,000 of development, regulatory and commercialization costs, some of which was credited
for costs incurred by the Company prior to the execution of the Adapt Agreement. At July 31, 2016, the Company had contributed
the full $2,500,000. At July 31, 2015, the Company had contributed $2,341,419 of which $204,908 was unpaid and reported in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities in the balance sheets.   

The Company recognizes revenue for fees
related to participation in the initial development plan and joint development calls as revenue once the fee is received and the
Company has performed the required services for the period. 

Treatment Investments  

With respect to investments in interests
in treatments, if an agreement provides an option that allows the investor in the treatment to convert an interest in a treatment
into shares of Common Stock of the Company, then revenue is deferred until such time that the option expires or milestones are
achieved that eliminate the investor s right to exercise the option. Upon expiration of the exercise option, the deliverables
of the arrangement are reviewed and evaluated under ASC 605. In the event the investor chooses to convert interests into shares
of Common Stock, that transaction will be accounted for similar to a sale of shares of Common Stock for cash.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
as of July 31, 2016 and 2015. 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  

The Company has
reviewed accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in
future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles
and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial
position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company s
financial management and certain standards are under consideration. Those standards have been addressed in the notes to the audited
financial statement and in this, the Company s Annual Report, filed on Form 10-K for the period ended July 31, 2016.

  Index to Financial Statements  

  July 31, 2016 and 2015  

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Lightlake Therapeutics
Inc.) 

 Santa Monica, California 

We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Lightlake Therapeutics Inc.) as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the
related statements of operations, stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(formerly Lightlake Therapeutics Inc.) as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered losses from operations and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding these matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Notes to Financial Statements  

  For the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015  

1.      Organization and Basis of Presentation    

Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
( we ,  our , or the  Company ), a Nevada corporation, is a specialty pharmaceutical company
which develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company was incorporated in the
State of Nevada on June 21, 2005 as Madrona Ventures, Inc. and, on September 16, 2009, the Company changed its name to Lightlake
Therapeutics Inc. On January 28, 2016, the Company again changed its name to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Company is a specialty
pharmaceutical company developing opioid antagonist treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company also
has developed a treatment to reverse opioid overdoses, which is now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray.
The Company s fiscal year end is July 31. 

Reverse Stock Split  

 In December 2014, the Company
effected a one-for-one hundred reverse stock split (the  1:100 Reverse Stock Split ) of its common stock, par value,
$0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) which decreased the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding from
approximately 182.0 million shares to approximately 1.82 million shares. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts included in the
financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for the stock splits as if such stock splits occurred on
the first day of the first period presented. Impacted amounts include but are not limited to shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding, stock options, shares reserved, exercise prices of warrants or options, and loss per share. There was no impact on
preferred or Common Stock authorized resulting from the 1:100 Reverse Stock Split. 

2.    Going Concern    

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred significant losses, a working capital
deficit as of July 31, 2016 of $2,380,539 and is dependent on generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining adequate capital
to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or obtain the
necessary funding it could cease operations as a new enterprise. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.  

At this time, the Company cannot provide investors with any assurance that it will be able to generate sufficient revenues
and/or obtain sufficient funding from debt financing and/or the sale of its Common Stock and/or the sale of interests in the
Company's prospective products and/or royalty transactions to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. The Company
does not have any arrangements in place for any future financing. The Company may also seek to obtain short-term loans from
its officers and directors to meet its short-term funding needs. 

3.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis of Presentation and
Use of Estimates  

 The Company prepares its financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 The Company considers all highly
liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
were $1,481,393 and $434,217 at July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions
insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Balances in the UK are insured up to  85,000 by the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme (UK Equivalent). The cash balances exceeded these insured amounts during the year. 

Accounts Receivable  

  The
Company routinely assesses the recoverability of receivables to determine their collectability by considering factors such as historical
experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's
ability to pay.   The Company determines its allowance
for doubtful accounts by considering such factors as the length of time balances are past due, the Company s previous loss
history, the customer s current ability to pay its obligations to the Company and the condition of the general economy and
the industry as a whole.   

Long-Lived Assets  

 The Company follows ASC 360,
 Property, Plant, and Equipment , for its fixed assets. Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives (3 to 7 years). The Company s capitalizes
all asset purchases greater than $500 having a useful life greater than one year. The Company follows ASC 350,  Intangibles
  Goodwill and Other  for its intellectual property asset. Intellectual property consists of patents which are stated
at their fair value acquisition cost. Amortization is calculated by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives
(20 years).   

Long-lived assets such as property
and equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair
value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets,
if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from
its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of
the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment
losses for any years presented. 

Earnings (Loss) per Share  

 The Company follows ASC 260,  Earnings
per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the respective period presented in the Company s
accompanying financial statements. 

Fully diluted earnings (loss)
per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of
Common Stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants). 

Common Stock equivalents represent
the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, at either
the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and only if the Common Stock equivalents
are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net loss position at the calculation date. 

Common Stock equivalents have
not been included in the calculation of dilutive earnings (loss) per share as the result would be anti-dilutive. At July 31, 2016,
potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents are approximately 5,850,385 (2015   4,496,052) which consist of options and
warrants. 

Research and Development Costs  

 The Company follows ASC 730,  Research
and Development , and expenses all research and development costs as incurred for which there is no alternative future use.
These costs also include the expensing of employee compensation and employee stock based compensation. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

 The Company s functional
and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Occasional transactions may occur in British Pounds and management has adopted
ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Translation Matters . Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement
of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

 ASC 718  Compensation
  Stock Compensation  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which
employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and
other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair
values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the
award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 

The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,  Equity   Based
Payments to Non-Employees.  Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value
of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value
of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. 

The Company had stock-based compensation
of $11,496,025 and $1,729,216 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The carrying value of certain
on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These
financial instruments include cash, accounts payable, note payable, and due to related parties. The fair value of the Company s
note payable is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different
from its stated value. 

As of July 31, 2016 and 2015,
the Company did not have any financial liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company s balance sheets on
a recurring basis. 

Related Parties  

 The Company follows ASC 850, 
Related Party Disclosures ,   for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Related
party balance as of July 31, 2016 amount to $0 (2015 - $130,000), and was comprised of loans to the Company. (See Note 4) 

Revenue Recognition  

 The Company recognizes revenues
from nonrefundable, up-front license fees related to collaboration agreements, on a straight-line basis over the contracted or
estimated period of performance. The period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over
which the research and/or development is expected to occur or manufacturing services are expected to be provided. When the period
of performance is based on the period over which research and/or development is expected to occur, the Company is required to make
estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines. Because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with
the development of drug candidates, these estimates regarding the period of performance may change. 

In addition, the Company evaluates
each arrangement to determine whether or not it qualifies as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement under ASC 605-25. If one
or more of the deliverables have a standalone value, then the arrangement would be separated into multiple units of accounting.
This normally occurs when the R D services could contractually and feasibly be provided by other vendors or if the customer
could perform the remaining R D itself, and when the Company has no further obligations and the right has been conveyed. When
the deliverables cannot be separated, any initial payment received is treated like an advance payment for the services and recognized
over the performance period, as determined based on all of the items in the arrangement. This period is usually the expected research
and development period. 

The Company recognizes revenue
from milestone payments upon achievement of the milestones and when the Company has no further involvement or obligation to perform
services, as related to that specific element of the arrangement, provided the milestone is meaningful, and provided that collectability
is reasonably assured and other revenue recognition criteria are met. 

The Company recognizes revenue
from royalty revenue when the Company has fulfilled the terms of the contractual agreement and has no material future obligation,
other than inconsequential and perfunctory support, and the amount of the royalty fee is determinable and collection is reasonably
assured. 

Licensing Agreement  

 On December 15, 2014, the Company
entered into a licensing agreement (the  Adapt Agreement ) with Adapt Pharma Operations Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Adapt Pharma Limited ( Adapt ), an Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, the Company
provided a global license to develop and commercialize the Company s intranasal naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment,
now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. In exchange for licensing its treatment, the Company received a
nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $500,000 in December 2014. The Company also received a monthly fee for one year for participation
in joint development committee calls and the production and submission of an initial development plan. The initial development
plan was completed and submitted in May 2015. Management evaluated the deliverables of this arrangement and determined that the
licensing deliverable had a standalone value and therefore, the payments were recognized as revenue. 

The Company could also receive
additional payments upon reaching various sales and regulatory milestones as well as royalty payments for commercial sales of NARCAN
generated by Adapt. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company received $4,500,000 of milestone payments and recognized royalty
revenues of approximately $418,000 pursuant to the Adapt Agreement. 

In addition, pursuant to the
Adapt Agreement, the Company is required to contribute $2,500,000 of development, regulatory and commercialization costs, some
of which was credited for costs incurred by the Company prior to the execution of the Adapt Agreement. At July 31, 2016, the Company
had contributed the full $2,500,000. At July 31, 2015, the Company had contributed $2,341,419 of which $204,908 was unpaid and
reported in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the balance sheets.   

The Company recognizes revenue
for fees related to participation in the initial development plan and joint development calls as revenue once the fee is received
and the Company has performed the required services for the period. 

Treatment Investments  

 With respect to investments in
interests in treatments, if an agreement provides an option that allows the investor in the treatment to convert an interest in
a treatment into shares of Common Stock of the Company, then revenue is deferred until such time that the option expires or milestones
are achieved that eliminate the investor s right to exercise the option. Upon expiration of the exercise option, the deliverables
of the arrangement are reviewed and evaluated under ASC 605. In the event the investor chooses to convert interests into shares
of Common Stock, that transaction will be accounted for similar to a sale of shares of Common Stock for cash.  

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements  

 The Company has implemented all
new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are
any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

       Deferred Revenue    

On April 16, 2013, the Company
entered into an agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Potomac Construction Limited ( Potomac ),
in the amount of $600,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of a product relating to the Company s
treatment to reverse opioid overdoses (the  Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product ). In exchange for this funding,
the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 6.0% interest (the  6.0% Investor Interest ) in the  OORT Net
Profit  generated from the product in perpetuity.  OORT Net Profit  is defined as any pre-tax profits received
by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product less any and all expenses incurred
by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, including but not limited
to an allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to product-related
activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. The investor also has rights with respect to the
6.0% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product is not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months, the investor will have
a 60 day option to exchange its 6.0% Investor Interest for 75,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended
July 31, 2015, the Company recognized $600,000 as revenue because the investor s option to receive the shares of Common Stock
expired unexercised, and the research and development work related to the product was completed as of July 31, 2015. 

On
May 30, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling
$150,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In exchange
for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the  2013 1.5% Investor Interest )
in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights
with respect to the 2013 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. 
 If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was
not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange
its 2013 1.5% Investor Interest for 18,750 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company
recognized $150,000 as revenue because the investor s option to receive the shares of Common Stock expired unexercised, and
the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2015.  

On December 17, 2013, the Company
entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling $250,000 for use by
the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.5% interest in the
Company s BED treatment product (the  BED Treatment Product ) and pay the investor 0.5% of the BED Net Profit
in perpetuity (the  2013 0.5% Investor Interest ).  BED Net Profit  is defined as the pre-tax profit generated
from the BED Treatment Product after the deduction of all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with
the BED Treatment Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead. If the BED Treatment Product is not
approved by the FDA by December 17, 2016, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its entire 0.5% Investor Interest
for 31,250 shares of Common Stock of the Company. 

On May 15, 2014, the Company
entered into an agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Ernst Welmers, in the amount of $300,000 for use
by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the
 2014 1.5% Investor Interest ) in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product
in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 2014 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not approved by the FDA by May 15,
2016, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for 37,500 shares of Common Stock
of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015, and, as a result,
the investor did not realize the option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company.
During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $300,000 as revenue because the investor s option to receive
the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product was completed as of July 31, 2016. 

On July 22, 2014,
the Company received a $3,000,000 commitment from a foundation (the  Foundation ) which later assigned its invest
to Valour Fund, LLC ( Valour ) in October 2016, from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the
Foundation for the research, development, marketing, commercialization and any other activities connected to the Opioid
Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, certain operating expenses and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the
Foundation. In exchange for funds invested by the Foundation, Valour currently owns a 6.0% interest in the OORT Net Profit
(the  6.0% Fund Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. Valour
also has rights with respect to the 6.0% Fund Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the
Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 6.0% Fund Interest within 2.5 years or
after 2.5 years of the July 22, 2014 initial investment date at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant
investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not
approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe for marketing and was not actually marketed by July 22, 2016, the
Foundation would have had a 60 day option to receive shares of the Company s Common Stock in lieu of the 6.0% Fund
Interest in the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product at an exchange rate of 10 shares for every dollar of its
investment. On July 28, 2014, the Company received an initial investment of $111,470 from the Foundation in exchange for a
0.22294% interest. On August 13, 2014, September 8, 2014, November 13, 2014 and February 17, 2015, the Company made capital
calls of $422,344, $444,530, $1,033,614 and $988,042, respectively, from the Foundation in exchange for 0.844687%, 0.888906%,
2.067228% and 1.976085% interests, respectively, in the OORT Net Profit. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was
approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015, and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange its 6.0% Fund
Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $3,000,000 as
revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work
related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016.  

On September 9, 2014, the Company
entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount
of $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with
a 0.98% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the  September 2014 0.98% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 0.98% Investor Interest if the Opioid
Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part,
the September 2014 0.98% Investor Interest (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the September
9, 2014 initial investment date, at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented
by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and not
approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed within 24 months of the September 9, 2014 initial investment
date, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock
of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015 and, as a result, the
investor did not realize the option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.
During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $500,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common
Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed
as of July 31, 2016. 

On
September 17, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding totaling
$500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose.   In exchange for this funding, the Company
agreed to provide the investor with a 1.0% interest in the Company s BED Treatment Product and pay the investor 1.0% of the
BED Net Profit generated from the BED Treatment Product in perpetuity (the  1.0% Investor Interest ).  BED Net Profit 
is defined as the pre-tax profit generated from the BED Treatment Product after the deduction of all expenses incurred by and payments
made by the Company in connection with the BED Treatment Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead.
If the BED Treatment Product is not approved by the FDA by September 17, 2017, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange
its entire 1.0% Investor Interest for 62,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company.   

On October 31, 2014, the Company
entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount
of $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with
a 0.98% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the  October 2014 0.98% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.98% interest if the Opioid Overdose
Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the October
2014 0.98% Investor Interest from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the
October 31, 2014 investment date at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented
by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and was
not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed by October 31, 2016, the investor would have had a 60
day option to exchange its October 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015 and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange
its October 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $500,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and
development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016. 

On July 20, 2015, the Company
entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount
of $250,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with
a 0.5% interest in the BED Net Profit (the  2015 0.5% Investor Interest ) generated from the BED Treatment Product
in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest if the BED Treatment Product is sold
or the Company is sold. If the product is not introduced to the market and not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe
and not marketed by July 20, 2018, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest for 25,000
shares of Common Stock of the Company. 

On
September 22, 2015, the Company received a $1,600,000 commitment from the Foundation which later assigned its interest to
Valour in October 2016, from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the Foundation  for the research,
development, any other activities connected to the Company s opioid antagonist treatments for addictions and related
disorders that materially rely on certain studies funded by the Foundation s investment, excluding the Opioid
Overdose Reversal Treatment Product (the  Certain Studies Products ), certain operating expenses, and any other
purpose consistent with the goals of the Foundation.     In exchange for funds
invested by the Foundation, Valour currently owns 2.1333% interest in the Certain Studies Products Net Profit (the
 2.1333% Interest ). The  Certain Studies Net Profit  is defined as any pre-tax revenue received by
the Company that was derived from the sale of the Certain Studies Products less any and all expenses incurred by and payments
made by the Company in connection with the Certain Studies Products, including but not limited to an allocation of Company
overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to Certain Studies Product-related
activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. Valour also has rights with respect to its up
to a 2.1333% Interest if the Certain Studies Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back,
in whole or in part, the 2.1333% Interest from Valour within 2.5 years or after 2.5 years of the initial investment at a
price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back.
If an aforementioned treatment is not introduced to the market by September 22, 2018, Valour will have a 60 day option to
exchange its 2.1333% Interest for shares of the Common Stock of the Company at an exchange rate of one-tenth of a share for
every dollar of its investment. On October 2, 2015, December 23, 2015, and May 28, 2016, the Company made capital calls
of $618,000, $715,500 and $266,500 from the Foundation in exchange for 0.824%, 0.954% and 0.355333% interests in
the aforementioned treatments, respectively. The Company will defer recording revenue until such time as
Valour s option expires or milestones are achieved that eliminates Valour s right to exercise the option. Upon
expiration of the exercise option, the deliverables of the arrangement will be reviewed and evaluated under Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 605. In the event Valour chooses to exchange its 2.1333% Interest, in whole or in part, for
shares of Common Stock of the Company, that transaction will be accounted for similar to a sale of shares of Common Stock for
cash.  

On
December 8, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, to receive $500,000 for use by the Company for
any purpose, which $500,000 was invested by December 18, 2015. In exchange for this funding, the Company granted the investor a
0.75% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the  0.75% Investor Interest ) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.75% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal
Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold.   Additionally,
the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 0.75% Investor Interest, from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after
2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the December 8, 2015 initial investment date, at a price of two times or 3.5 times,
respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. Such buyback can be for a portion
of the 0.75% Investor Interest rather than for the entire interest. The investor also had an option to invest an additional $1,000,000
by February 29, 2016 for use by the Company for any purpose in exchange for a 1.50% interest in the OORT Net Profit. If such investment
were made, then the investor also would have rights with respect to its 1.50% interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment
Product was sold or the Company was sold. This investor option expired unexercised. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $500,000 as revenue because the investment did not contain any option to exchange the 0.75% Investor Interest for shares
of Common Stock of the Company, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product
was completed as of July 31, 2016.

upon written notice to Aegis. The Company has granted Aegis a co-exclusive license with the Company to use the data from the
Company s Studies under the Restated Aegis Agreement for certain purposes. Pursuant to the Restated Aegis Agreement,

9.   
       Commitments    

On December 18, 2014, the Company
entered into a consulting agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the consultant agreed to provide financial advisory services with
regard to the licensing agreement with Adapt Pharma Operations Limited described in Note 3. In exchange for these services, the
Company incurred fixed fees of $225,000 and $75,000 during the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
Company is also required to pay an additional fee equivalent to 3.75% of all amounts received by the Company pursuant to the licensing
agreement in excess of $3,000,000, in perpetuity. Total fees incurred during the year ended July 31, 2016 amounted to $317,917. 

The Company leases office space

CA 90401 for $5,056 per month. The lease with Premier Office Centers, LLC ( Premier ), as amended effective October
1, 2016, has an initial term of five months and shall automatically renew for successive six month periods unless terminated by
the Company in writing 60 days prior to the termination date. Premier may terminate the lease for any reason upon 30 days

The Company recognizes deferred
tax assets and liabilities using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences
are expected to reverse. This method requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight
of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

As of July 31, 2016, the Company s
deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards that were derived from operating losses from
prior years as well as stock based compensation expense. A full valuation allowance has been applied to the Company s deferred
tax assets. The valuation allowance will be reduced when and if the Company determines it is more likely than not that the related
deferred income tax assets will be realized. 

The Company s NOL carryforwards
can be carried forward to offset future taxable income for a period of 20 years for each tax year s loss. These NOL carryforwards
begin to expire in 2026. No provision was made for federal income taxes as the Company has significant NOLs. All of the Company's income tax years remained open for examination by taxing authorities. 

The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts
which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to the net loss before provision for income taxes for
the following reasons: 

Net deferred tax assets consist
of the following components as of: 

The Company had no uncertain
tax positions at July 31, 2016 or July 31, 2015. 

On October 6, 2016 the Company received
$500,000 from Adapt as a regulatory milestone payment pursuant to the Adapt Agreement. This payment was triggered by the Health
Canada approval of Adapt s naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to treat opioid overdose, to be marketed as NARCAN  Nasal
Spray. 

On October 6, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase a total of 50,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable on a cashless
basis to two employees. These options all have an exercise price of $10.00 and a term of 10 years. The options vest as follows:

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.  

None. 

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of July 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation,
the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of July 31, 2016 that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses indicated below. 

Management's Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting  

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over financial reporting , as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company. 

Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s
management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

The Company s management recognizes
that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control and, accordingly, even effective internal
control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material
misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes
in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with the Company s established policies and procedures. 

A material weakness is a significant deficiency,
or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as of July 31, 2016, based on the framework set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its
evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of July 31, 2016. 

The Company s management assessed
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016 and identified the following material
weaknesses:  

a)  
      Lack of audit committee. The Company does not have a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.   

b)  
      Lack of proper segregation of duties due to limited personnel.   

c)  
      Lack of a formal review process related to financial reporting that includes multiple levels of review.   

The Company s management is committed
to improving the Company s internal controls and will: (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls
in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities; (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations
of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel; and (3) may
consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in the future. 

The Company s management, including
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have discussed the material weakness noted above with
the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more
than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that
would not be prevented or detected. 

This Annual Report does not include an
attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings  

To the best of the Company s knowledge,
none of the Company s directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years: 

been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding
traffic violations and other minor offenses);   

had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any
partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of
the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;   

been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated,
of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending
or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings
and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;   

been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action
has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;   

been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment,
decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to (i) an alleged violation of any federal or state
securities or commodities law or regulation, (ii) any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies
including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or
temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or (iii) any law or regulation prohibiting mail
or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or   

been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended
or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as
defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.   

Except as set forth in the Company s
discussion below in  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence , none of the Company s
directors or executive officers has been involved in any transactions with the Company or any of the Company s directors,
executive officers, affiliates, or associates which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission.  

Term of Office  

The Company s directors are elected
by the Company s stockholders for a one-year term until the next annual general meeting of the Company s stockholders,
or until removed by the stockholders in accordance with the Company s bylaws. The Company s officers are appointed
by the Board and hold office until removed by the Board. 

Code of Ethics  

The Company does not currently have a code
of ethics, and because the Company has only limited business operations and only three officers and six directors, the Company
believes that a code of ethics would have limited utility. The Company intends to adopt such a code of ethics as the Company s
business operations expand and the Company has more employees. 

Director Independence  

Pursuant to Rule
5605 of The NASDAQ Stock Market, one of the definitions of an independent director is a person other than an executive officer
or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with
the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board has reviewed the materiality
of any relationship that each of the directors has with the Company, either directly or indirectly. Based on this review, the Board
has determined that the only independent directors are Mr. Geoffrey Wolf, Ms. Ann MacDougall and Dr. Gabrielle Silver. 

Corporate Governance  

For reasons similar
to those described above, the Company does not have a nominating and corporate governance committee, a compensation committee nor
an audit committee of the Board. The Board consists of six directors. The Company receives limited revenues. At such time that
the Company generates or expects to generate significant revenues, the Company plans to propose creating committees of its Board,
including a nominating and corporate governance committee, a compensation committee and an audit committee. Accordingly, the Company
does not have an audit committee financial expert. 

Board of Directors and Director
Nominees  

Since the Board
has three independent directors, the decisions of the Board regarding director nominees are made by persons who have an interest
in the outcome of the determination. The Board will consider candidates for directors proposed by stockholders, although no formal
procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Unless otherwise determined, at any time not less than 10 days prior to
the next annual stockholder meeting at which a slate of director nominees is elected, the Board will accept written submissions
from proposed nominees that include the name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee; a brief statement of the nominee s
qualifications to serve as a director; and a statement as to why the stockholder submitting the proposed nominee believes that
the nomination would be in the best interests of the Company s stockholders. If the proposed nominee is not the same person
as the stockholder submitting the name of the nominee, a letter from the nominee agreeing to the submission of his or her name
for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a r sum  supporting
the nominee s qualifications to serve on the Board, as well as a list of references. 

The Board identifies
director nominees through a combination of referrals from different people, including management, existing Board members and stockholders.
Once a candidate has been identified, the Board reviews the individual s experience and background and may discuss the proposed
nominee with the source of the recommendation. If the Board believes it to be appropriate, Board members may meet with the proposed
nominee before making a final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of the slate of director nominees
submitted to stockholders for election to the Board. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership
Reporting Compliance  

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock to file with the
SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership in our Common Stock and other equity securities. Specific
due dates for these records have been established, and we are required to report any failure in the fiscal year ended July 31,
2016 to file by these dates. 

Based solely upon a review of copies of such forms filed on
Forms 3 and 4, and amendments thereto furnished to us, we believe that (i) from December 2014 to October 2015, Dr. Roger Crystal,
Geoffrey Wolf and Kevin Pollack were not in compliance with their respective Section 16(a) filing requirements, (ii) from December
2014 to December 2015, Dr. Michael Sinclair was not in compliance with his Section 16(a) filing requirements, and (iii) from May
2016 to September 2016, Dr. Gabrielle Silver and Ann MacDougall were not in compliance with their respective Section 16(a) filing
requirements. Each of Dr. Crystal and Mr. Wolf had a Form 3 reporting 11 and nine transactions, respectively, that was filed late
and Mr. Pollack had a Form 4 reporting 8 transactions that was filed late. Dr. Sinclair had a Form 4 reporting 14 transactions
that was filed late. Dr. Silver and Ms. MacDougall each had a Form 3 reporting zero transactions that was filed late.

2016. 

From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, Dr. Sinclair

incentive bonus in the aggregate amount of $318,000 upon the occurrence of certain  Incentive Bonus Events  (as defined
in the Sinclair Employment Agreement, as amended on December 31, 2013, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on February 25, 2014). 

From January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2016, Dr. Sinclair will receive a base salary of $350,000. The Company shall pay Dr. Sinclair no less than $265,000 of the base

with a minimum of 50% of the balance due being paid by September 30, 2017, and the remaining balance paid by March 31, 2018. 

From January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2016, Dr. Sinclair shall be eligible to earn an incentive bonus in an amount and structure agreed upon by Dr. Sinclair and the
Board. The amount of the incentive bonus payment shall be determined based the achievement of specific milestones, representing
a combination of both individual management objectives and corporate objectives. The Board shall, in its sole discretion, determine
whether such objectives have been achieved, and the amount of Dr. Sinclair s incentive bonus, if any. Any bonus awarded thereunder
shall be paid no later than February 15, 2017 and shall be subject to applicable payroll tax withholdings and deductions. 

The Company may terminate Dr. Sinclair
for  Cause  (as defined below) at any time during the term of the Sinclair Employment Agreement. Upon a termination
for Cause, Dr. Sinclair shall not be entitled to severance pay or any other special payment, except that Dr. Sinclair shall be
entitled to all such options and warrants that have vested and all  Owed Amounts  (as defined in the Sinclair Employment
Agreement) within 60 days of such termination.  Cause  means: termination based upon Dr. Sinclair s (i) willful
breach or willful neglect of his duties and responsibilities; (ii) conviction of or a plea of no contest with respect to a felony
occurring on or after the execution of the Sinclair Employment Agreement; (iii) material breach of the Sinclair Employment Agreement;
(iv) acts of fraud, dishonesty, misappropriation, or embezzlement; (v) willful failure to comply with the Board s reasonable
orders or directives consistent with Dr. Sinclair s position; or (vi) becoming disqualified or prohibited by law from serving
as Executive Chairman of the Company;  provided ,  however , that in the case of any act or failure to act described
in clauses (i), (iii), or (v) above, such act or failure to act will not constitute Cause if, within ten (10) days after notice
of such act or failure to act is given to Dr. Sinclair by the Company, Dr. Sinclair has corrected such act or failure to act (if
it is capable of correction). 

If during the term of the Sinclair Employment
Agreement the Company terminates Dr. Sinclair s employment or Dr. Sinclair resigns within 12 months of a  Constructive
Termination  (as defined below) of his employment, and in either case such termination is not for Cause, the Company shall
pay Dr. Sinclair within 60 days of such termination the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts, (ii) $350,000 and (iii) one times the Incentive
Bonus Cash Compensation (as defined in the Sinclair Employment Agreement) earned by Dr. Sinclair, regardless of whether paid to
Dr. Sinclair, from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 (the  Sinclair 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation ).
In the event of such termination, all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the
like held by Dr. Sinclair on his last day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award
and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. Constructive Termination shall occur if: (i) either (A) there is a reduction
of any amounts of Dr. Sinclair s compensation set forth in the Sinclair Employment Agreement, or a reduction in annual cash
pay or a material adverse change to the incentive plan that affects Dr. Sinclair differentially and adversely from other employees,
management, and/or officers with comparable levels of responsibility; (B) there is a material change in Dr. Sinclair s authority,
duties, or responsibilities, including without limitation Dr. Sinclair s ceasing to be the Executive Chairman, or Dr. Sinclair s
no longer being part of the executive team; (C) Dr. Sinclair ceases to be a member of the Board, except in the event of termination
for Cause or his death or disability; (D) upon the Company s or its successor s reasonable request, Dr. Sinclair refuses

harassment or abuse as a result of his race, color, religion, creed, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability;
(F) there is a failure of a successor of the Company to assume the obligations of the Sinclair Employment Agreement; or (G) there
is a material breach by the Company of the Sinclair Employment Agreement; and (ii) Dr. Sinclair provides the Board written notice
within 30 days after the occurrence of one or more of the above events in (i); and (iii) the Board does not remedy the condition
so identified within 30 days. 

The Company may terminate Dr. Sinclair s
employment for disability. In the event of a termination as a result of his disability, the Company shall pay Dr. Sinclair on the
date which is 60 days after the date of such termination the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Sinclair is entitled to;
(ii) (A) $350,000; and (iii) one-half (0.5) times the Sinclair 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such termination,
all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Sinclair on his last
day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason
whatsoever. 

In the event that Dr. Sinclair: (i) is
employed by the Company on December 31, 2016; and (ii) has not been renewed for employment as Executive Chairman from January 1,
2017 through at least December 31, 2017 with at least the following terms: (A) annual base cash pay that is at least $350,000 with
such annual base cash pay paid by the Company to Dr. Sinclair on at least a monthly basis; (B) benefits with at least the same
terms as set forth in the Sinclair Employment Agreement; and (C) termination provisions and Fundamental Transaction provisions
comparable to those set forth in the Sinclair Employment Agreement, then the Company shall pay Dr. Sinclair on the date which is
no later than February 15, 2017 the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Sinclair is entitled to; (ii) $350,000; and (iii)
one-half (0.5) times the Sinclair 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such non-renewal of employment, all outstanding
stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Sinclair on his last day of service
shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. 

To the extent that during the term of
the Sinclair Employment Agreement there shall be a  Fundamental Transaction  (as hereinafter defined),
notwithstanding any term to the contrary in the Sinclair Employment Agreement, Dr. Sinclair shall be entitled to receive the
 Fundamental Transaction Compensation  (as hereafter defined). A  Fundamental Transaction  shall mean
the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects, complete or consummates, as applicable any
(i) merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another person, or (ii) reclassification, reorganization or
recapitalization of the Company s Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Company s
Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (iii) sale, lease, license,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of 50% or more of its assets, (iv) purchase offer, tender offer or
exchange offer (whether by the Company or another person) pursuant to which holders of Company s Common Stock are
permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the
holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Company s Common Stock, or (v) stock or share purchase agreement or
other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of
arrangement) with another person or group of persons whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Company s Common Stock (not including any shares of Company s Common Stock held by the
other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or party to, such
stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination).  Fundamental Transaction Compensation  shall
mean the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Sinclair is entitled to; (ii) $350,000; and (iii) one (1) times the
Sinclair 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, all outstanding stock options,
warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Sinclair on his last day of service shall
become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever.
Unless the Board shall reasonably determine otherwise in good faith, in the event that the Company effects a Fundamental
Transaction, each option and warrant then outstanding (the  Equity Grants ) shall be fully exercisable regardless
of the exercise schedule otherwise applicable to such Equity Grant. The holder of such Equity Grant, and the
shares underlying such Equity Grant, shall have the right to receive the consideration per share receivable by other holders
of shares of the Company s Common Stock as a result of such Fundamental Transaction. If holders of shares of the
Company s Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction with respect to the shares, then the Equity Grant holder shall be given the same choice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction and if the Board may reasonably determine in good faith, the Equity
Grants may be (i) honored or assumed, or new rights substituted therefore (such honored, assumed or substituted award
hereinafter called an  Alternative Award ), by the Company or its affiliates or any successor entity in the
Fundamental Transaction immediately following the Fundamental Transaction; provided that any such Alternative Award
must provide each holder with (a) rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than the rights, terms and
conditions applicable under the Equity Grant and (b) substantially equivalent value to such Equity Grant (determined at the
time of the Fundamental Transaction); or (ii) purchased by the Company by paying to the holder an amount of cash equal to the
value of the remaining unexercised portion of the Equity Grant on the date of the consummation of such
Fundamental Transaction to be determined by a reasonable method selected by the Board in good faith. In the event that a
successor entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction,
the provisions of Equity Grants referring to the  Company  shall refer instead to the successor entity) the
Company, such successor entity may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of
the Company under an Equity Grant with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named as the Company therein. The
Fundamental Transaction Compensation shall be paid to Dr. Sinclair within 20 days of the Fundamental Transaction. For
avoidance of confusion, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction while Dr. Sinclair is employed by the Company, Dr. Sinclair
shall be entitled to the Fundamental Transaction Compensation and not any other termination compensation set forth elsewhere
in Paragraph 7 of the Sinclair Employment Agreement. In the event that Dr. Sinclair is terminated for any reason and within
one (1) year of termination there is a Fundamental Transaction, then Dr. Sinclair shall be entitled to the Fundamental
Transaction Compensation. 

Except as otherwise provided therein, in
the event that: (a) there is no termination of Dr. Sinclair or a Fundamental Transaction as per the terms of Paragraph 7 therein;
and (b) Dr. Sinclair either (i) fails to provide the  Services  (as defined in the Sinclair Employment Agreement) until
December 31, 2016; or (ii) leaves the employ of the Company before December 31, 2016, then Dr. Sinclair shall waive: (a) all rights
to any base compensation not yet earned; (c) all rights to any bonus compensation not yet earned; (d) all rights to any paid time
off not yet earned; (e) all rights to any options not yet issued; and (f) all rights to the benefit plans set forth in Paragraph
6 therein, except that Dr. Sinclair shall receive four (4) months of such benefit plans and/or relevant reimbursements. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Dr. Sinclair shall be entitled to keep all vested warrants and options that have been issued to Dr. Sinclair and
he shall be entitled to all Owed Amounts to which he is entitled to, which Owed Amounts shall be paid by the Company to Dr. Sinclair
within 60 days. 

The Company remains obligated to issue
Dr. Sinclair stock options of no less than three percent (3%) of the amount of shares issued and outstanding on a fully diluted
basis as of December 15, 2015. As of July 31, 2016, the Company did not actually issue Dr. Sinclair the aforementioned stock options.
The Company remains obligated to register all Common Stock underlying all of the options and warrants held by Dr. Sinclair and
to adopt a tax-efficient stock incentive plan. As of July 31, 2016, the Company has not met these obligations.

Events  (as defined in the Crystal Employment Agreement, as amended on December 31, 2013, filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company s
Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2014). 

From January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2016, Dr. Crystal will receive a base salary of $593,750. The Company shall pay Dr. Crystal no less than $450,000 of the base salary
earned between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, and all amounts in excess of the amounts actually paid shall accrue, with

From January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2016, Dr. Crystal shall be eligible to earn an incentive bonus in an amount and structure agreed upon by Dr. Crystal and the Board.
The amount of the incentive bonus payment shall be determined based the achievement of specific milestones, representing a combination
of both individual management objectives and corporate objectives. The Board shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether such
objectives have been achieved, and the amount of Dr. Crystal s incentive bonus, if any. Any bonus awarded thereunder shall
be paid no later than February 15, 2017 and shall be subject to applicable payroll tax withholdings and deductions. 

The Company may terminate Dr. Crystal for
 Cause  (as defined below) at any time during the term of the Crystal Employment Agreement. Upon a termination for
Cause, Dr. Crystal shall not be entitled to severance pay or any other special payment, except that Dr. Crystal shall be entitled
to all such options and warrants that have vested and all  Owed Amounts  (as defined in the Crystal Employment Agreement)
within 60 days of such termination.  Cause  means: termination based upon Dr. Crystal s (i) willful breach or

acts of fraud, dishonesty, misappropriation, or embezzlement; (v) willful failure to comply with the Board s reasonable orders

Chief Executive Officer of the Company;  provided ,  however , that in the case of any act or failure to act described
in clauses (i), (iii), or (v) above, such act or failure to act will not constitute Cause if, within ten (10) days after notice
of such act or failure to act is given to Dr. Crystal by the Company, Dr. Crystal has corrected such act or failure to act (if
it is capable of correction). 

If during the term of the Crystal Employment
Agreement the Company terminates Dr. Crystal s employment or Dr. Crystal resigns within 12 months of a  Constructive
Termination  (as defined below) of his employment, and in either case such termination is not for Cause, the Company shall

the event of such termination, all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like
held by Dr. Crystal on his last day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and
shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. Constructive Termination shall occur if: (i) either (A) there is a reduction

Agreement; or (G) there is a material breach by the Company of the Crystal Employment Agreement; and (ii) Dr. Crystal provides
the Board written notice within 30 days after the occurrence of one or more of the above events in (i); and (iii) the Board does
not remedy the condition so identified within 30 days. 

The Company may terminate Dr. Crystal s
employment for disability. In the event of a termination as a result of his disability, the Company shall pay Dr. Crystal on the
date which is 60 days after the date of such termination the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Crystal is entitled to;
(ii) (A) $593,750; and (iii) one-half (0.5) times the Crystal 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such termination,
all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Crystal on his last
day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason
whatsoever. 

In the event that Dr. Crystal: (i) is employed
by the Company on December 31, 2016; and (ii) has not been renewed for employment as Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2017
through at least December 31, 2017 with at least the following terms: (A) annual base cash pay that is at least $593,750 with such
annual base cash pay paid by the Company to Dr. Crystal on at least a monthly basis; (B) benefits with at least the same terms
as set forth in the Crystal Employment Agreement; and (C) termination provisions and Fundamental Transaction provisions comparable
to those set forth in the Crystal Employment Agreement, then the Company shall pay Dr. Crystal on the date which is no later than
February 15, 2017 the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Crystal is entitled to; (ii) $593,750; and (iii) one-half (0.5)
times the Crystal 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such non-renewal of employment, all outstanding stock
options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Crystal on his last day of service shall
become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. 

To the extent that during the term of the
Crystal Employment Agreement there shall be a Fundamental Transaction, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in the Crystal
Employment Agreement, Dr. Crystal shall be entitled to receive the  Fundamental Transaction Compensation  (as hereafter
defined).  Fundamental Transaction Compensation  shall mean the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Dr. Crystal is
entitled to; (ii) $593,750; and (iii) one (1) times the Crystal 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of a Fundamental
Transaction, all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Dr. Crystal
on his last day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited
for any reason whatsoever. Unless the Board shall reasonably determine otherwise in good faith, in the event that the Company effects
a Fundamental Transaction, each Equity Grant shall be fully exercisable regardless of the exercise schedule otherwise applicable
to such Equity Grant. The holder of such Equity Grant, and the shares underlying such Equity Grant, shall have the right to receive
the consideration per share receivable by other holders of shares of the Company s Common Stock as a result of such Fundamental
Transaction. If holders of shares of the Company s Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property
to be received in a Fundamental Transaction with respect to the shares, then the Equity Grant holder shall be given the same choice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction and if the Board may reasonably determine in good faith,
the Equity Grants may be (i) Alternative Awards by the Company or its affiliates or any successor entity in the Fundamental Transaction
immediately following the Fundamental Transaction; provided that any such Alternative Award must provide each holder
with (a) rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than the rights, terms and conditions applicable under the
Equity Grant and (b) substantially equivalent value to such Equity Grant (determined at the time of the Fundamental Transaction);
or (ii) purchased by the Company by paying to the holder an amount of cash equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion
of the Equity Grant on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction to be determined by a reasonable method selected
by the Board in good faith. In the event that a successor entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after
the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of Equity Grants referring to the  Company  shall refer instead
to the successor entity) the Company, such successor entity may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume
all of the obligations of the Company under an Equity Grant with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named as
the Company therein. The Fundamental Transaction Compensation shall be paid to Dr. Crystal within 20 days of the Fundamental Transaction.
For avoidance of confusion, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction while Dr. Crystal is employed by the Company, Dr. Crystal
shall be entitled to the Fundamental Transaction Compensation and not any other termination compensation set forth elsewhere in
Paragraph 7 of the Crystal Employment Agreement. In the event that Dr. Crystal is terminated for any reason and within one (1)

of such act or failure to act is given to Mr. Pollack by the Company, Mr. Pollack has corrected such act or failure to act (if
it is capable of correction). 

If during the term of the Pollack Employment
Agreement the Company terminates Mr. Pollack s employment or Mr. Pollack resigns within 12 months of a  Constructive

not remedy the condition so identified within 30 days. 

The Company may terminate Mr. Pollack s
employment for disability. In the event of a termination as a result of his disability, the Company shall pay Mr. Pollack on the
date which is 60 days after the date of such termination the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Mr. Pollack is entitled to;
(ii) (A) $562,500; and (iii) one-half (0.5) times the Pollack 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such termination,
all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Mr. Pollack on his last
day of service shall become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason
whatsoever. 

In the event that Mr. Pollack: (i) is employed
by the Company on December 31, 2016; and (ii) has not been renewed for employment as Chief Financial Officer from January 1, 2017
through at least December 31, 2017 with at least the following terms: (A) annual base cash pay that is at least $562,500 with such
annual base cash pay paid by the Company to Mr. Pollack on at least a monthly basis; (B) benefits with at least the same terms
as set forth in the Pollack Employment Agreement; and (C) termination provisions and Fundamental Transaction provisions comparable

times the Pollack 2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of such non-renewal of employment, all outstanding stock
options, warrants, restricted share awards, performance grants and the like held by Mr. Pollack on his last day of service shall
become fully vested and remain exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. 

To the extent that during the term of the
Pollack Employment Agreement there shall be a Fundamental Transaction, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in the Pollack
Employment Agreement, Mr. Pollack shall be entitled to receive the  Fundamental Transaction Compensation (as hereafter defined).
A Fundamental Transaction shall mean the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects, complete
or consummates, as applicable any (i) merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another person, or (ii) reclassification,
reorganization or recapitalization of the Company s Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Company s
Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (iii) sale, lease, license, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of 50% or more of its assets, (iv) purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another person) pursuant to which holders of Company s Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Company s
Common Stock, or (v) stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another person or group of persons whereby such other person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company s Common Stock (not including any shares of Company s Common
Stock held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or
party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination).  Fundamental Transaction Compensation 
shall mean the sum of: (i) all Owed Amounts to which Mr. Pollack is entitled to; (ii) $562,500; and (iii) one (1) times the Pollack
2015 Incentive Bonus Cash Compensation. In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, all outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted
share awards, performance grants and the like held by Mr. Pollack on his last day of service shall become fully vested and remain
exercisable for the life of such award and shall not be forfeited for any reason whatsoever. Unless the Board shall reasonably
determine otherwise in good faith, in the event that the Company effects a Fundamental Transaction, each Equity Grant shall be
fully exercisable regardless of the exercise schedule otherwise applicable to such Equity Grant. The holder of such Equity Grant,
and the shares underlying such Equity Grant, shall have the right to receive the consideration per share receivable by other holders
of shares of the Company s Common Stock as a result of such Fundamental Transaction. If holders of shares of the Company s
Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction with respect
to the shares, then the Equity Grant holder shall be given the same choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Fundamental
Transaction and if the Board may reasonably determine in good faith, the Equity Grants may be (i) Alternative Awards by the Company
or its affiliates or any successor entity in the Fundamental Transaction immediately following the Fundamental Transaction; provided that
any such Alternative Award must provide each holder with (a) rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than
the rights, terms and conditions applicable under the Equity Grant and (b) substantially equivalent value to such Equity Grant
(determined at the time of the Fundamental Transaction); or (ii) purchased by the Company by paying to the holder an amount of
cash equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion of the Equity Grant on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental
Transaction to be determined by a reasonable method selected by the Board in good faith. In the event that a successor entity shall
succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of Equity Grants
referring to the  Company  shall refer instead to the successor entity) the Company, such successor entity may exercise
every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under an Equity Grant with the same
effect as if such successor entity had been named as the Company therein. The Fundamental Transaction Compensation shall be paid
to Mr. Pollack within 20 days of the Fundamental Transaction. For avoidance of confusion, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction
while Mr. Pollack is employed by the Company, Mr. Pollack shall be entitled to the Fundamental Transaction Compensation and not
any other termination compensation set forth elsewhere in Paragraph 7 of the Mr. Pollack Employment Agreement. In the event that
Mr. Pollack is terminated for any reason and within one (1) year of termination there is a Fundamental Transaction, then Mr. Pollack
shall be entitled to the Fundamental Transaction Compensation. 

Except as otherwise provided therein, in
the event that: (a) there is no termination of Mr. Pollack or a Fundamental Transaction as per the terms of Paragraph 7 therein;
and (b) Mr. Pollack either (i) fails to provide the  Services  (as defined in the Pollack Employment Agreement) until
December 31, 2016; or (ii) leaves the employ of the Company before December 31, 2016, then Mr. Pollack shall waive: (a) all rights
to any base compensation not yet earned; (c) all rights to any bonus compensation not yet earned; (d) all rights to any paid time
off not yet earned; (e) all rights to any options not yet issued; and (f) all rights to the benefit plans set forth in Paragraph
6 therein, except that Mr. Pollack shall receive four (4) months of such benefit plans and/or relevant reimbursements. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Mr. Pollack shall be entitled to keep all vested warrants and options that have been issued to Mr. Pollack and he
shall be entitled to all Owed Amounts to which he is entitled to, which Owed Amounts shall be paid by the Company to Mr. Pollack
within 60 days. 

The Company remains obligated to issue
Mr. Pollack stock options of no less than six percent (6%) of the amount of shares issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis
as of December 15, 2015. As of July 31, 2016, the Company did not actually issue Mr. Pollack the aforementioned stock options.
The Company remains obligated to register all Common Stock underlying all of the options and warrants held by Mr. Pollack and to
adopt a tax-efficient stock incentive plan. As of July 31, 2016, the Company has not met these obligations. 

401(k) Retirement Plan  

The Company sponsors and maintains the
Opiant Pharmaceuticals Inc 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the  401(k) Retirement Plan ) which is a traditional

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,
and Director Independence.  

The
following are the related party transactions in which the Company has engaged since August 1, 2015:      

The Company uses office space provided
by Michael Sinclair in London, England, and Kevin Pollack in New York City, New York, free of charge.     

At July 31, 2015, the Company had an aggregate
of $130,000 of loans outstanding to a director of the Company, Geoffrey Wolf, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Kevin
Pollack, and the Company s Chairman, Dr. Michael Sinclair, in the individual amounts of $65,000, $13,000 and $52,000, respectively.
In December 2012, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $350,000 pursuant to promissory notes with each of Geoffrey Wolf, Kevin
Pollack and Dr. Michael Sinclair, in the individual amounts of $175,000, $35,000 and $140,000, respectively. Each promissory note
accrued interest at 6.0% per year and was due in December 2013. Each promissory note was amended on December 16, 2013 to extend
the final maturity date to January 6, 2015 and increase the interest rate to 8.5% per annum. During the year ended July 31, 2015,
an aggregate of $220,000 of the principal amount was repaid. In December 2014, the promissory notes were further amended to extend
the maturity date to April 30, 2016 and increase the annual interest rate to 14.5%, which includes a penalty rate of 8.5% due to
non-payment of the required repayment amounts. The loans were unsecured. On January 22, 2016, the Company repaid Mr. Wolf all outstanding
principal and accrued interest underlying his note, and on January 25, 2016, the Company repaid Dr. Sinclair and Mr. Pollack all
outstanding principal and accrued interest underlying their notes. 

During September 2015 and October 2015,
the Company received an aggregate of $151,191 of loans from each of the Company s President, Dr. Roger Crystal, the Company s
Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Pollack, and the Company s Chairman, Dr. Michael Sinclair, in the individual amounts of $51,191,
$50,000 and $50,000, respectively. The loans each bore interest at 6% per annum until January 31, 2016. The loans were all unsecured
and were due on January 31, 2016 unless the Company received specified funding. If the Company received the specified funding the
loans become due 10 business days after the funding. If the loans were not repaid by January 31, 2016, the maturity date of the
loans shall be changed to May 31, 2016 and a penalty interest of 4% per annum would be added. On December 15, 2015, the Company
repaid Dr. Sinclair and Mr. Pollack all outstanding principal and accrued interest underlying their loans, and on December 16,
2015, the Company repaid Dr. Crystal all outstanding principal and accrued interest underlying his loan. 

Director Independence  

Because the Company s Common Stock
is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, the Company has used the definition of  independence  of
The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an  independent director 
is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion
of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;   

the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);   

a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;   

the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);   

the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or   

the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit.   

Based on the rule listed above, the Board determined that the
Company s only independent directors are Mr. Geoffrey Wolf, Ms. Ann MacDougall and Dr. Gabrielle Silver. 

The Company does not currently have a separately designated
audit, nominating, or compensation committee.

WHEREAS , the Investor
has agreed to invest Six Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$600,000.00) to fund the research, development, marketing, and any other commercialization

1.1         The Company hereby

perpetuity from the Effective Date (the   Interest  ).  Net profit  shall be defined as the pre-tax
profits generated from the Product after the deduction of all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection
with the Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and
resources devoted by Company to Product-related activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company (the
  Net Profit  ). 

2.    Net Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.    

2.1         The Company shall
provide the Investor with an annual audit of Net Profits (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed after
the end of each calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 2.1 shall not be applicable until the Product
generates Net Profit. 

2.2         After the end of
each quarter of the calendar year, the Company shall provide the Investor with a written or electronic update with respect to the
status of the Product. If the Product generates Net Profit, then the Company shall also provide the Investor with a written or
electronic statement of the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest.

each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Investor eighty percent (80%) of such
calendar quarter s Net Profits represented by the Interest, which amount shall be estimated in good faith by the Company.
Upon the completion of the Audit for such calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Investor the Net Profits represented
by the Interest for the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the
Net Profits represented by the Interest for the first three quarters of the calendar year (the   Audited NP  )

quarters (the   Estimated NP  ), then the Company shall distribute to the Investor the difference between the
Audited NP and the Estimated NP. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Audited NP to be less than the
Estimated NP, then the Company shall deduct the difference between the Estimated NP and the Audited NP from the distribution for
the fourth quarter of such calendar year and, if required, each following distribution until such amount is fully deducted.

of all expenses and costs related to such sale. All other material transactions involving the Product not addressed herein shall
be addressed in good faith by the Company and the Investor. 

3.    Option to Exchange Interest for Common Stock.    

3.1         If the Product is
not introduced to the market within twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Date, then the Investor shall have the option to
receive seven million five hundred thousand (7,500,000) shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the   Shares  ) in lieu of the Interest (the   Option  ). 

3.2         In the event that
Product is not approved for marketing within twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Date, then the Investor shall have sixty
(60) calendar days to provide written notice that the Investor intends to exercise the Option. The Investor shall waive their rights

and, together with the Initial Consulting Agreement, the   Initial Agreement  ), whereby the third party consultants,
using their expertise in the biopharmaceutical space, provided certain consulting and advisory services to the Company during the
period commencing on the Effective Date through the three (3) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the   Services  ); 

WHEREAS , the Company has developed a
treatment to reverse opioid overdoses (known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray (the   Product  ); 

WHEREAS , pursuant to the Initial Agreement,
the Company, in exchange for the Services provided by the third party consultants, assigned the third party consultants the right
to receive a certain amount of the financial return produced by the Product; and 

WHEREAS , the third party consultants
have since assigned their rights and obligations under the Initial Agreement to the Consultant and the Consultant and the Company
now desire to amend and restate the Initial Agreement to (i) reflect the occurrence of events since the Effective Date, (ii) incorporate
the terms of the Letter Agreement and (iii) add the Consultant, and remove the third party consultants, as a party to this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE ,
with reference to the foregoing facts, the Company and the Consultant agree as follows: 

1.    Interest Assignment.  

1.1         In exchange for
the Services provided by the third party consultants, the Consultant shall receive the right to receive, pro rata, five percent
(5%) of the Net Profit generated from the Product in perpetuity from the Effective Date (the   Interest  ).   Net
Profit   shall be defined as any pre-tax revenue received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Product
less any and all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Product, including but not limited
to an allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to Product-related
activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. 

2.    Net Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.    

2.1         The Company shall
provide the Consultant with an annual audit of Net Profit (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed after
the end of each calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 2.1 shall not be applicable until the Product

2.2         After the end of
each quarter of the calendar year, the Company shall provide the Consultant with a written or electronic update with respect to
the status of the Product. If the Product generates Net Profit, then the Company shall also provide the Consultant with a written
or electronic statement of the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest. 

2.3         After the end of
each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Consultant eighty percent (80%) of such

be addressed in good faith by the Company and the Consultant.

Exhibit 10.22  

AMENDED AND RESTATED
INTEREST AGREEMENT  

This
Amended and Restated Interest Agreement (this   Agreement  ) is entered into on October 24, 2016 (the
  Execution Date  ), and made effective as of July 22, 2014 (the   Effective Date  ), by
and between OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ), and Valour  Fund, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and successor in interest to this Agreement (  Valour  ).  

WHEREAS , on the Effective Date, the
Company entered into that certain interest agreement (the   Initial Interest Agreement  ), as amended by a subsequent
letter agreement dated October 15, 2014, by and between the Company and a third party (the   Letter Agreement  
and, together with the Initial Interest Agreement, the   Initial Agreement  ), whereby the third party invested
Three Million Dollars (US$3,000,000) (the   Cumulative Investment  ) during a period commencing on July 28, 2014
(the   Initial Investment Date  ) through March 2, 2015, which funds have been and are being used for the research,
development, marketing, commercialization, and any other activities connected to the Company s treatment to reverse opioid
overdoses (now known as NARCAN  (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray (the   Product  )), operating expenses
(excluding investor relations and excluding renting an office), and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the third party
(each, a   Purpose  ); 

WHEREAS , pursuant to the Initial
Agreement, the Company, in exchange for the Cumulative Investment, assigned the third party the right to receive a certain amount
of the financial return produced by the Product; and 

WHEREAS , the third party has since
assigned its rights and obligations under the Initial Agreement to Valour, and Valour and the Company now desire to amend and restate
the Initial Agreement to (i) reflect the occurrence of events since the Effective Date, (ii) incorporate the terms of the Letter
Agreement and (iii) add Valour, and remove the third party, as a party to this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE ,
with reference to the foregoing facts, the Company and Valour   agree as follows: 

1.           The
Interest and Company Buyback Right.  

1.1           The
third party has previously provided the Cumulative Investment to the Company, which funds may be used for any Purpose. 

1.2           The
Company hereby agrees to assign to Valour, as the transferee of the third party, the right to receive six percent (6%) of the Net
Profit (as defined below) generated from the Product in perpetuity from the Effective Date (the   Interest  ).
The Interest shall not be transferrable or assignable to an unrelated third party.   Net Profit   shall be defined
as any pre-tax revenue received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Product less any and all expenses incurred
by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead
based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to Product-related activities, which allocation
shall be determined in good faith by the Company. 

1.3           Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, at all times after the Effective Date the Company shall have the right to buy back the
Interest or any portion of the Interest from Valour   by providing written or electronic notice to Valour   or one of its
representatives (each, an   Authorized Party  ). Any such notice shall include the percentage amount of the Interest
to be bought back by the Company, and such notice shall also include the dollar amount invested by the third party that equals
the percentage amount of the Interest to be bought back by the Company based on a one percent (1%) per each Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars (US$500,000.00) of the Cumulative Investment exchange (the   Buyback Amount  ). In the event that such
notice is provided within two and one half (2 ) years of the Initial Investment Date, then the Company shall pay Valour 
 two (2) times the Buyback Amount within ten (10) business days of providing such notice. In the event that such notice is provided
after two and one half (2 ) years from the Initial Investment Date, then the Company shall pay Valour   three and one
half (3 ) times the Buyback Amount within ten (10) business days of providing such notice. Upon the Company s paying
to Valour   the Buyback Amount with respect to the Interest or any portion of the Interest, such Interest or portion of the
Interest, as appropriate, shall be deemed either extinguished or transferred or sold back to the Company, at the Company s
direction, and have no further legal effect and the third party shall have no rights with respect to such amount of Interest bought
back by the Company.  For illustrative purposes, if such a notice is delivered three (3) years after the Effective Date and provides
for a Buyback Amount of One Million Dollars (US$1,000,000), which represents a two percent (2.0%) amount of Interest, then the
Company shall pay Valour     Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$3,500,000), which is equal to three and one
half (3 ) times the Buyback Amount, within ten (10) business days of such notice and upon such payment all of Valour s 
 rights related to such two percent (2%) amount of Interest shall cease as Valour     shall only own four percent (4%)
of Interest.  

2.           
 Net Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.  

2.1           The
Company shall provide Valour   with an annual audit of Net Profit (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed
after the end of each calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 2.1 shall not be applicable until the
Product generates Net Profit. 

2.2           After
the end of each quarter of the calendar year, the Company shall provide Valour   with a written or electronic update with respect
to the status of the Product. If the Product generates Net Profit, then the Company shall also provide Valour   with a written
or electronic statement of the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest. 

2.3           After
the end of each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to Valour   eighty percent (80%)
of such calendar quarter s Net Profit represented by the Interest, which amount shall be estimated in good faith by the Company.
Upon the completion of the Audit for such calendar year, the Company shall distribute to Valour   the Net Profit represented
by the Interest for the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the
Net Profit represented by the Interest for the first three quarters of the calendar year (the   Audited NP  )
to be greater than the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest actually paid to Valour   for the first three calendar
quarters (the   Estimated NP  ), then the Company shall distribute to Valour   the difference between the
Audited NP and the Estimated NP. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Audited NP to be less than the
Estimated NP, then the Company shall deduct the difference between the Estimated NP and the Audited NP from the distribution for
the fourth quarter of such calendar year and, if required, each following distribution until such amount is fully deducted. 

2.4           In
the event that the Product is sold by the Company, then Valour   shall receive the percentage Interest that it holds of the
net proceeds of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and costs related
to such sale. In the event that the Company is sold, then the Company shall engage an independent financial or accounting firm
to determine the fair value of the Company which is directly attributable to the Product and Valour   shall receive the percentage
Interest that it owns of such amount after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale. All other material transactions
involving the Product not addressed herein shall be addressed in good faith by the Company and Valour.  For illustrative purposes,
with a Cumulative Investment equal to Three Million Dollars (US$3,000,000), which represents a six percent (6%) amount of Interest,
then in the event that the Product is sold by the Company, Valour   shall receive six percent (6%) of the net proceeds of such
sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale.   

3.           Representations
and Warranties of the Company.  

The Company represents
and warrants to Valour   that: 

3.1           The

Agreement  ), or received by the Company from any transaction contemplated by the Adapt Agreement, shall be the responsibility
and obligation solely of the Company or its successor. Valour   agrees and covenants, for the benefit of the Company and Adapt,
Adapt s successors, assigns and sublicensees and each of their respective shareholders, directors, officers and employees
(the   Adapt Parties  ), that it shall under no circumstances seek payment or other compensation for any such
amount directly from any Adapt Party or assert any claim against any Adapt Party in relation to the Adapt Agreement or any transactions
contemplated thereby.

 . 

  WHEREAS , the
Company has agreed to assign the Investor the right to receive a certain amount of the financial return produced by the Product; 

NOW THEREFORE ,
with reference to the foregoing facts, the Company and the Investor agree as follows: 

1.           Investment
and Interest Assignment.  

1.1           The
Investor shall by December 18, 2015 make the Investment into the Company, which funds may be used for any Company purpose at the
discretion of the Company. In connection with the Investment, the Company hereby agrees to assign the Investor the right to receive,
pro rata, 75/100ths of one percent (0.75%) of the net profit generated from the Product in perpetuity from the Effective Date (the
  Interest  ).  Net profit  shall mean any pre-tax revenue received by the Company that was derived
from the sale of the Product less any and all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Product,

per Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$500,000.00) of investment (the   Additional Buyback Amount  ). In the event
that such notice is provided within two and one half (2 ) years of the date of the Additional Investment into the Company,

2.             Net
Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.

Company shall provide the Investor with an annual audit of Net Profits (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed
after the end of each calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 2.1 shall not be applicable until the
Product generates Net Profit. 

2.2           After
the end of each quarter of the calendar year, the Company shall provide the Investor with a written or electronic update with respect
to the status of the Product. If the Product generates Net Profit, then the Company shall also provide the Investor with a written
or electronic statement of the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest and represented by the Additional Interest, if
there is an Additional Interest. 

2.3           After
the end of each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Investor eighty percent (80%)
of such calendar quarter s Net Profits represented by the Interest and the Additional Interest, if there is an Additional
Interest, which amount shall be estimated in good faith by the Company. Upon the completion of the Audit for such calendar year,
the Company shall distribute to the Investor the Net Profits represented by the Interest and the Additional Interest, if there
is an Additional Interest, for the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines
the Net Profits represented by the Interest and the Additional Interest, if there is an Additional Interest, for the first three
quarters of the calendar year (the   Audited NP  ) to be greater than the estimated Net Profits represented by
the Interest and the Additional Interest, if there is an Additional Interest, actually paid to the Investor for the first three
calendar quarters (the   Estimated NP  ), then the Company shall distribute to the Investor the difference between
the Audited NP and the Estimated NP. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Audited NP to be less than
the Estimated NP, then the Company shall deduct the difference between the Estimated NP and the Audited NP from the distribution
for the fourth quarter of such calendar year and, if required, each following distribution until such amount is fully deducted. 

2.4           In
the event that the Product is sold by the Company, then the Investor shall receive 75/100ths of one percent (0.75%) of the net
proceeds of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to
such sale. In the event that the Company is sold, then the Company shall engage an independent financial or accounting firm to
determine the fair value of the Company which is directly attributable to the Product and the Investor shall receive 75/100ths
of one percent (0.75%) of such amount after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale. If there is an Additional
Interest, then in the event that the Product is sold by the Company, then the Investor shall receive one and one half of one percent
(1.50%) of the net proceeds of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and
costs related to such sale. If there is an Additional Interest, then in the event that the Company is sold, then the Company shall
engage an independent financial or accounting firm to determine the fair value of the Company which is directly attributable to
the Product and the Investor shall receive one and one half of one percent (1.50%) of such amount after the deduction of all expenses
and costs related to such sale. All other material transactions involving the Product not addressed herein shall be addressed in
good faith by the Company and the Investor.

incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company
overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by Company to Product-related activities, which allocation
shall be determined in good faith by the Company (the   Net Profit  ). 

2.           
 Net Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.  

2.1           The
Company shall provide the Investor with an annual audit of Net Profits (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed

3.3           After
the end of each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Investor eighty percent (80%)
of such calendar quarter s Net Profits represented by the Interest, which amount shall be estimated in good faith by the
Company. Upon the completion of the Audit for such calendar year, the Company shall distribute to the Investor the Net Profits
represented by the Interest for the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines
the Net Profits represented by the Interest for the first three quarters of the calendar year (the   Audited NP  )
to be greater than the estimated Net Profits represented by the Interest actually paid to the Investor for the first three calendar
quarters (the   Estimated NP  ), then the Company shall distribute to the Investor the difference between the
Audited NP and the Estimated NP. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Audited NP to be less than the
Estimated NP, then the Company shall deduct the difference between the Estimated NP and the Audited NP from the distribution for
the fourth quarter of such calendar year and, if required, each following distribution until such amount is fully deducted. 

3.4           In
the event that the Product is sold by the Company, then the Investor shall receive one half percent (0.5%) of the net proceeds
of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale.
In the event that the Company is sold, then the Company shall engage an independent financial or accounting firm to determine the
fair value of the Company which is directly attributable to the Product and the Investor shall receive one half percent (0.5%)
of such amount after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale. All other material transactions involving the
Product not addressed herein shall be addressed in good faith by the Company and the Investor. 

3.           
 Option to Exchange Interest for Common Stock.  

3.1           If
the Product is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date, then
the Investor shall have the option to receive twenty-five thousand (25,000) shares of the Company s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the   Shares  ) in lieu of the Interest (the   Option  ). If the Product is
not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date, then the Investor
shall have sixty (60) calendar days to provide written notice to the Company that the Investor intends to exercise the Option.
The Investor shall waive its rights to the Option if the Investor fails to provide written notice to the Company of its intent
to exercise the Option within such sixty (60) calendar days. If the Investor exercises the Option, then the Investor shall waive
all rights to the Interest and receive fully paid and non-assessable Shares.

 EXHIBIT 10.31

Exhibit 10.31  

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTEREST AGREEMENT  

This
Amended and Restated Interest Agreement (this   Agreement  ) is entered into on October 24, 2016 (the
  Execution Date  ), and made effective as of September 22, 2015 (the   Effective Date  ),
by and between LIGHTLAKE THERAPEUTICS INC., a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ), and Valour Fund, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and successor in interest to this Agreement (  Valour  ).  

WHEREAS , on the Effective Date, the Company
entered into that certain interest agreement (the   Initial Agreement  ), whereby the third party invested One
Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000) (the   Cumulative Investment  ) during a period commencing on
October 6, 2015 (the   Initial Investment Date  ) through May 20, 2016, which funds have been and are being used
for the Company s development of opioid antagonist treatments for addictions and related disorders that materially rely,
as determined in good faith by the Company, on certain studies agreed upon by the Company and the third party, and which treatments
do not include treatments for reversing opioid overdoses (the   Products  ); 

WHEREAS , the Cumulative
Investment has been used for research, development, any other activities connected to the Products, operating expenses (excluding
investor relations, bonuses, and renting an office), and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the third party (each,
a   Purpose  ); 

WHEREAS , pursuant to the Initial Agreement,
the Company, in exchange for the Cumulative Investment, assigned the third party the right to receive a certain amount of the financial
return produced by the Products; and 

WHEREAS , the third
party has since assigned its rights and obligations under the Initial Agreement to Valour, and Valour and the Company now desire
to amend and restate the Initial Agreement to (i) reflect the occurrence of events since the Effective Date and (ii) add Valour,
and remove the third party, as a party to this Agreement. 

NOW THEREFORE , with
reference to the foregoing facts, the Company and Valour agree as follows: 

1.    Capital Calls and Interest.    

1.1         The third party
has previously provided the Cumulative Investment to the Company, which funds may be used for any Purpose. 

1.2         The Company hereby
agrees to assign to Valour, as the transferee of the third party, the right to receive a total of two and two fifteenths percent
(2.1333)% of the Net Profit (as defined below) generated from the Products in perpetuity from the Effective Date (the   Interest  ).
The Interest shall not be transferrable or assignable to an unrelated third party.   Net Profit   shall be defined
as any pre-tax revenue received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Products less any and all expenses incurred
by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Products, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead
based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by Company to Products-related activities, which allocation shall
be determined in good faith by the Company. 

1.3         Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, at all times after the Effective Date the Company shall have the right to buy back the
Interest or any portion of the Interest from Valour by providing written or electronic notice to Valour or one of its representatives
(each, an   Authorized Party  ). Any such notice shall include the percentage amount of the Interest to be bought
back by the Company, and such notice shall also include the dollar amount invested by the third party that equals the percentage
amount of the Interest to be bought back by the Company based on the one percent (1%) per each Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
(US$750,000.00) of Cumulative Investment exchange (the   Buyback Amount  ). In the event that such notice is provided
within two and one half (2 ) years of the Initial Investment Date, then the Company shall pay Valour two (2) times the Buyback
Amount within ten (10) business days of providing such notice. In the event that such notice is provided after two and one half
(2 ) years from the Initial Investment Date, then the Company shall pay Valour three and one half (3 ) times the Buyback
Amount within ten (10) business days of providing such notice. Upon the Company s paying to Valour the Buyback Amount with
respect to the Interest or any portion of the Interest, such Interest or portion of the Interest, as appropriate, shall be deemed
either extinguished or transferred or sold back to the Company, at the Company s direction, and have no further legal effect
and Valour shall have no rights with respect to such amount of Interest bought back by the Company.  For illustrative purposes,
if such a notice is delivered three (3) years after the Initial Investment Date and provides for a Buyback Amount of Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars (US$750,000.00), which represents a one percent (1.0%) amount of Interest, then the Company shall pay Valour
Two Million Six Hundred Twenty Five Dollars (US$2,625,000.00), which is equal to three and one half (3 ) times the Buyback
Amount within ten (10) business days of such notice and upon such payment all of the Valour s rights related to such one percent
(1.0%) amount of Interest shall cease as Valour shall only own one and two fifteenths percent (1.1333)% of Interest.  

2.    Net Profit Audits, Updates, Distributions and Other Transactions.    

2.1         The Company shall
provide Valour with an annual audit of Net Profits (the   Audit  ), which Audit shall be completed after the end
of each calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 2.1 shall not be applicable until the Products generate
Net Profit. 

2.2         After the end of
each quarter of the calendar year, the Company shall provide Valour with a written or electronic update with respect to the status
of the Products. If the Products generate Net Profit, then the Company shall also provide Valour with a written or electronic statement
of the estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest. 

2.3         After the end of
each of the first three quarters of the calendar year, the Company shall distribute to Valour eighty percent (80%) of such calendar
quarter s Net Profit represented by the Interest, which amount shall be estimated in good faith by the Company. Upon the
completion of the Audit for such calendar year, the Company shall distribute to Valour the Net Profit represented by the Interest
for the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In the event that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Net Profit represented
by the Interest for the first three quarters of the calendar year (the   Audited NP  ) to be greater than the
estimated Net Profit represented by the Interest actually paid to Valour for the first three calendar quarters (the   Estimated
NP  ), then the Company shall distribute to Valour the difference between the Audited NP and the Estimated NP. In the event
that the Audit for such calendar year determines the Audited NP to be less than the Estimated NP, then the Company shall deduct
the difference between the Estimated NP and the Audited NP from the distribution for the fourth quarter of such calendar year and,
if required, each following distribution until such amount is fully deducted. 

2.4         In the event that
any of the Products are sold by the Company, then Valour shall receive the percentage Interest that it holds of the net proceeds
of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale.
In the event that the Company is sold, then the Company shall engage an independent financial or accounting firm to determine the
fair value of the Company which is directly attributable to the Products and Valour shall receive the percentage Interest that it
owns of such amount after the deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale. All other material transactions involving
the Products not addressed herein shall be addressed in good faith by the Company and Valour.  For illustrative purposes, with
a Cumulative Investment equal to One Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$1,600,000.00) , which represents two and two fifteenths
percent (2.1333)% amount of Interest, then in the event that one of the Products is sold by the Company, Valour shall receive two
and two fifteenths percent (2.1333%) of the net proceeds of such sale, pro rata, and in the form of such net proceeds, after the
deduction of all expenses and costs related to such sale.   

3.    Option to Exchange Interest for Common Stock.    

3.1         If none of the Products
are introduced to the market within thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date, then Valour shall have the option to receive
a number of shares of common stock at a rate equal to Fifty Thousand (50,000) shares of the Company s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, per each Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$500,000.00) of Cumulative Investment, up to a total maximum of One
Hundred Sixty Thousand (160,000) shares of the Company s common stock for One Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$1,600,000.00)
of Cumulative Investment (the   Shares  ) in lieu of the Interest (the   Option  ). Shares shall
be adjusted for stock splits and standard adjustments. 

3.2         In the event that
none of the Products are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or an equivalent body in Europe for marketing and none
of the Products are actually marketed within thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date, then Valour shall have sixty (60)
calendar days to provide written notice to the Company that Valour intends to exercise the Option. Valour shall waive their rights
to the Option if it fails to provide sixty (60) calendar days written notice to the Company of its intent to exercise the Option
within such sixty (60) calendar days. If Valour exercises the Option, then it shall waive all rights to the Interest and receive
fully paid and non-assessable Shares. 

4.    Representations and Warranties of the Company.    

The Company represents
and warrants to Valour that: 

4.1         The Company is a public
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Nevada and has all requisite power and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. 

4.2         This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, or the availability of
equitable remedies. 

5.    Representations, Warranties and Agreements of Valour.    

Valour represents and warrants
to, and agrees with, the Company as follows: 

5.1          No Guarantee of

Product, is accurate and complete in all material respects and not misleading and will update Torreya promptly if it becomes aware
of any material developments or proposals in relation to the Product that would be likely to directly or indirectly impact on the
Transaction. 

In addition, Torreya will ultimately rely

authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.    

Annex A Indemnity   

LIGHTLAKE THERAPEUTICS INC.  (the
 Company ) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless TORREYA PARTNERS (EUROPE) LLP ( Advisor ), and its agents,
representatives, employees, officers, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, the  Indemnitees  and each
individually an  Indemnitee ), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all claims,
demands, causes of action, obligations, losses, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses arising in law, equity or otherwise, of
any nature whatsoever, including without limitation, any and all legal, accounting and other professional fees and related costs
and disbursements and other costs, expenses, or disbursements relating thereto (collectively, the  Liabilities ), directly
or indirectly caused by, relating to, based upon, arising out of, or in connection with any act or omission of the Company in connection
with the Engagement Letter between the Advisor and the Company to which this Annex A is an integral part or the transactions contemplated
thereby, including, without limitation, any violation of applicable laws or regulations by the Company (or any affiliate thereof);
or any breach by the Company of any of the terms of the Engagement Letter between the Advisor and the Company. 

The Company may, at its own expense, seek
reimbursement of amounts already paid to such Indemnitee once and to the extent the relevant Liabilities are determined in a final
judgment by court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) to have resulted primarily and proximately from any
Indemnitee s gross negligence or willful misconduct. These indemnification provisions are in addition to any liability that
the Company may otherwise have to any Indemnitee. 

The Company further agrees that no Indemnitee
will have any liability for any Liabilities (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company (or any
affiliate thereof), or to any person (including, without limitation, Company shareholders) claiming through the Company (or any
affiliate thereof) in connection with the engagement of the Advisor in connection with the acts or omissions of any such Indemnitee
or any other Indemnitee, except to the extent that any such Liabilities are found in final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction
(not subject to further appeal) to have resulted primarily and proximately from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Indemnitee seeking indemnification. 

In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution, if a claim for indemnification pursuant to these indemnification provisions is made but it is found in final judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case,
then the Company, on the one hand, and the claiming Indemnitees on the other hand, will contribute to the losses, claims, damages,
obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, liabilities, costs, expenses and disbursements (collectively, the  Losses )
to which such Indemnitees may be subject. Said contribution will be made in accordance with all relative benefits received by,
and the fault of, the Company on the one hand, and such Indemnitees on the other hand, in connection with the statements, acts
or omissions which resulted in such Losses, together with the relevant equitable considerations. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
the Indemnitees will not be obligated to contribute in the aggregate for all of the Losses in any amount that exceeds the aggregate
amount of fees actually received by the Advisor pursuant to the Engagement Letter. 

Torreya Partners (Europe) LLP is
authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.    

If any action, suit, proceeding, or investigation
commenced which gives rise to a claim for indemnification and which, in any Indemnitee s reasonable judgment, gives rise
to a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitees, then the Indemnitees will have the right to retain legal counsel
of their own choice to represent and advise them, and the Company will pay the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of one
(1) law firm for all Indemnitees incurred from time to time in the manner set forth above. Such law firm will, to the extent consistent
with their professional responsibilities, cooperate with the Company and any counsel designated by the Company. Neither the Company
nor any affiliate thereof will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee seeking indemnification, settle or compromise
any actual, potential or threatened claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder, or permit a default or consent to the
entry of any judgment in respect thereof, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes, as an unconditional term thereof,
the giving by the claimant to the Indemnitees of an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim. 

Neither termination nor completion of the
engagement of the Advisor pursuant to the Engagement Letter will affect these indemnification provisions, which will survive any
such termination or completion and remain operative and in full force and effect. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in the Engagement Letter or this Annex A is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained
herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 

The Company indemnifies Torreya for any
liabilities and costs (including reasonable professional fees) arising from the Company or other recipients of Torreya s
services under this letter agreement not providing information in regard to place of belonging for VAT purposes at the relevant
VAT tax point dates and any liabilities arising from the Company or other recipients of Torreya s services under this letter
agreement failing to comply with any reverse charge requirements in respect of VAT (or equivalent tax).
