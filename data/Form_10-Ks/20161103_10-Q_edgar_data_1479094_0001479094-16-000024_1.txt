  1. Organization     and     Description of Business 
    
  STAG Industrial, Inc. (the  Company ) is an industrial real estate operating company focused on the acquisition and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. The Company was formed as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be treated and intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).  The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, commonly called an UPREIT, and owns substantially all of its assets and conducts substantially all of its business through its operating partnership, STAG Industrial Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership ). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned a   95.2%   and   95.1%  , respectively, common equity interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.  As used herein, the  Company  refers to STAG Industrial, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships, including the Operating Partnership, except where context otherwise requires. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   300   buildings in   37   states with approximately   58.6 million   rentable square feet, consisting of   236   warehouse/distribution buildings,   47   light manufacturing buildings,   16   flex/office buildings, and   one   building in redevelopment. The Company s buildings were approximately   95.3%   leased to   262   tenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Interim Financial Information 
    
  The accompanying interim financial statements have been presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair statement in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The year-end consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries. Interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company are referred to as  Noncontrolling Common Units.  These Noncontrolling Common Units are held by other limited partners in the form of common units ("Other Common Units") and long term incentive plan units ( LTIP units ) issued pursuant to the STAG Industrial, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the  2011 Plan ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation of entities. The financial statements of the Company are presented on a consolidated basis for all periods presented. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which provides clarified guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard effective July 1, 2016, and the effects of this standard were applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The effect of the change in accounting principle was an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately   $2.0 million   for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and a corresponding increase in net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the payment of loan prepayment fees and costs.   
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of cash flow. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after  
  
   8                                                         

     Table of Contents  

December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2016. As a result, the Company's policy is to recognize forfeitures in the period which they occur, whereas the former guidance required the Company to estimate expected forfeitures. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has certain operating and land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, Topic 840,   Leases  . The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In April of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30)  . ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (Subtopic 835-30)  , which clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016. As a result, debt issuance costs related to the debt liabilities that are not line-of-credit arrangements are included as a direct deduction from the related debt liability and those related to line-of-credit arrangements continue to be included as an asset within prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effects of this standard were applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The effect of the change in accounting principle was the reduction of unsecured term loans by approximately   $3.4 million  , unsecured notes by approximately   $2.3 million  , and mortgage notes by approximately   $1.3 million   and a corresponding reduction of prepaid expenses and other assets by approximately   $6.9 million   as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  In February of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)  , which amends the current consolidation model. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this standard, modifying the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities or voting interest model entities. The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model. Under the revised guidance, the Operating Partnership will be a variable interest entity of the Company. As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the financial statements of the Company, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption. In addition, there were no voting interest entities under prior existing guidance determined to be variable interest entities under the revised guidance. 
    
  In January of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10)  . The amendments in ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and for annual periods and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August of 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending

     Table of Contents  

December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May of 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     (Topic 606)  . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from a lease contract with a tenant is not within the scope of this revenue standard. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. Additionally, this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Rental Property 
    
  The Company capitalizes costs directly and indirectly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment, or improvement of rental property. Real estate taxes, compensation costs of development personnel, insurance, interest, and other directly related costs during construction periods are capitalized as incurred and depreciated commencing with the date the property is substantially completed. Such costs begin to be capitalized to the development projects from the point the Company is undergoing the necessary activities to get the development ready for its intended use and cease when the development projects are substantially completed and held available for occupancy. Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate of the Company's unsecured indebtedness during the period. 
    
  Tenant Accounts Receivable, net 
    
  Tenant accounts receivable, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both tenant accounts receivable, net and accrued rental income, net. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of tenant accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  The Company accrues rental income earned, but not yet receivable, in accordance with GAAP. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had accrued rental income of approximately   $17.7 million   and   $16.1 million  , respectively. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from those revenues. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an allowance on accrued rental income of   $0   and   $0  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $6.9 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively, of total lease security deposits available in the form of existing letters of credit, which are not reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $4.3 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively, of lease security deposits available in cash, which are included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of lease security deposits available in cash, which are included in restricted cash on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These funds may be used to settle tenant accounts receivables in the event of a default under the related lease. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's total liability associated with these lease security deposits was approximately   $4.7 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, and is included in tenant prepaid rent and security deposits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Related Parties 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, of amounts due from related parties, which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Tenant Recoveries 
    
  By the terms of their leases, certain tenants are obligated to pay directly the costs of their properties  insurance, real estate taxes, ground lease payments, and certain other expenses, and these costs are not reflected on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not recognize recovery revenue related to leases where the tenant has assumed the cost for real estate taxes, insurance, ground lease payments and certain other expenses. To the extent any tenant responsible for these costs under its respective lease defaults on its lease or it is deemed probable that the tenant will fail to pay for such costs, the Company will record a liability for such obligation. The Company estimates that real estate taxes, which are the responsibility of these certain tenants, were approximately   $2.7 million  ,   $7.9 million  ,   $2.7 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. These amounts would have been the maximum real estate tax expense of the Company, excluding any penalties or interest, had the tenants not met their contractual obligations for these periods.  
    
  Termination Income 
    
  On October 20, 2015, the tenant at the Dayton, OH property exercised its early lease termination option per the terms of the lease agreement. The option provided that the tenant's lease terminate effective October 31, 2016 and required the tenant to pay a termination fee of approximately   $0.2 million  . The termination fee was being recognized on a straight-line basis from October 20, 2015 through the relinquishment of the space on October 31, 2016. On August 29, 2016, the Company sold the Dayton, OH property to an unaffiliated third party and recognized the remaining unamortized termination fee. The termination fee income of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   is included in rental income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Taxes 
    
  Federal Income Taxes 
    
  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT. The Company is generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to its stockholders that it derives from its REIT qualifying activities. As a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.  
    
  The Company will not be required to make distributions with respect to income derived from the activities conducted through subsidiaries that the Company elects to treat as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ) for federal income tax purposes, nor will it have to comply with income, assets, or ownership restrictions inside of the TRS. Certain activities that the Company undertakes must or should be conducted by a TRS, such as performing non-customary services for its tenants and holding assets that it cannot hold directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. On June 24, 2016, the Operating Partnership, through its wholly owned subsidiary, transferred a vacant land parcel located in Burlington, NJ to the Company's TRS. The Company's TRS recognized a net loss of approximately   $0.1 million  ,   $0.1 million  ,   $7,000   and   $7,000  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, which has been included on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  State and Local Income, Excise, and Franchise Tax 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to certain state and local income, excise, and franchise taxes. Taxes in the amount of   $0.2 million  ,   $0.7 million  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.8 million   have been recorded in other expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
    
  Tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits, with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. The measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the  more likely than not  threshold is based on a cumulative probability model under which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   liabilities for uncertain tax positions.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
    
  Concentrations of credit risk relevant to the Company may arise when a number of financing arrangements, including revolving credit facilities or derivatives, are entered into with the same lenders or counterparties, and have similar economic features that would cause their inability to meet contractual obligations. The Company mitigates the concentration of credit risk as it relates to financing arrangements by entering into loan syndications with multiple, reputable financial institutions and diversifying its debt counterparties. The Company also reduces exposure by diversifying its derivatives across multiple counterparties who meet established credit and capital guidelines.  
    
  Concentration of credit risk may also arise when the Company enters into leases with multiple tenants concentrated in the same industry, or into a significant lease or multiple leases with a single tenant, or tenants are located in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their inability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected. The Company regularly monitors its tenant base to assess potential concentrations of credit risk through financial statement review, tenant management calls, and press releases. Management believes the current credit risk portfolio is reasonably well diversified and does not contain any unusual concentration of credit risk.

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , amortization of deferred financing fees and debt issuance costs included in interest expense was approximately   $0.5 million  ,   $1.4 million  ,   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  On September 29, 2016, the Company assumed a mortgage note with Thrivent Financial for Lutherans of approximately   $4.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of the property located in Rock Hill, SC, which serves as collateral for the debt. The debt matures on December 15, 2023 and bears interest at   4.78%   per annum. The assumed debt was recorded at fair value and a fair value premium of approximately   $0.1 million   was recorded. The fair value of debt was determined by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate of approximately   4.45%   at which loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for loans with similar remaining maturities, similar terms, and similar loan-to-value ratios. The fair value of the debt is based on Level 3 inputs and is a nonrecurring fair value measurement.

Financial Covenant Considerations 
    
  The Company s ability to borrow under the unsecured credit facility and the unsecured term loans are subject to its ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants. The Company's unsecured notes and mortgage notes also contain financial and other covenants. The Company was in compliance with all such applicable restrictions and financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . In the event of a default under the unsecured credit facility or the unsecured term loans, the Company s dividend distributions are limited to the minimum amount necessary for the Company to maintain its status as a REIT. The real estate net book value of the properties that are collateral for the Company s debt arrangements was approximately   $261.2 million   and   $268.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and is limited to senior, property-level secured debt financing arrangements.  
    
  Fair Value of Debt 
    
  The fair value of the Company s debt was determined by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for loans with similar remaining maturities, similar terms, and similar loan-to-value ratios. The discount rates ranged from approximately   1.73%   to   4.45%   and   1.58%   to   4.82%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were applied to each individual debt instrument. The applicable fair value guidance establishes a three tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The fair value of the Company s debt is based on Level 3 inputs. The following table presents the aggregate principal outstanding of the Company s debt and the corresponding estimate of fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands). 

5. Use of Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
    
  The Company s use of derivative instruments is limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure on existing and future liabilities and not for speculative purposes. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and related costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure.

The following table details the Company s outstanding interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  .   

The fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows. 

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate swaps are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  The Company uses interest rate swaps to fix the rate of its long term variable rate debt. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified to interest expense in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings on the Company s variable rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings into interest expense. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a loss of   $0  ,   $0  ,   $0.1 million   and   $0  , respectively, of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings due to short-term, partial mismatches in notional amounts.  
    
  The Company estimates that approximately   $3.3 million   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months.

The table below details the location in the financial statements of the gain or loss recognized on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   (in thousands).   

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
    
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on the indebtedness. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of all of the Company's   23   interest rate swaps were in a liability position of approximately   $16.6 million  , excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements. The adjustment for nonperformance risk included in the fair value of the Company s net liability position was approximately   $0.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Accrued interest expense for the Company's interest rate swaps was approximately   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of its provisions at   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreement of the interest rate swaps in a liability position plus accrued interest for approximately   $16.7 million  . 
    
  Fair Value of Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  The Company s valuation of the interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined by using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  
    
  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 
    
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.  However, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.  As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

  Restricted Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, the Company grants restricted shares of common stock to certain employees of the Company. The restricted shares of common stock are subject to time-based vesting. Restricted shares of common stock granted on January 8, 2016, subject to the recipient s continued employment, will vest in   four   equal installments on January 1 of each year. Holders of restricted shares of common stock have voting rights and rights to receive dividends. Restricted shares of common stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of and are subject to a risk of forfeiture prior to the expiration of the applicable vesting period. The following table summarizes activity related to the Company s unvested restricted shares of common stock for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

The unrecognized compensation expense associated with the Company s restricted shares of common stock at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $3.8 million   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.3 years  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair value at vesting date for the restricted shares of common stock vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  

7. Noncontrolling Interest 
    
  The Company is structured as an UPREIT, and owns substantially all of its assets and conducts substantially all of its business through its Operating Partnership. The Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their subsidiaries. The table below summarizes the activity for noncontrolling interest in the Company for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

The Company adjusts the carrying value of noncontrolling interest to reflect its share of the book value of the Operating Partnership when there has been a change in the Company s ownership of the Operating Partnership. Such adjustments are recorded to additional paid-in capital as a rebalancing of noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Equity. 
    
  LTIP Units 
    
  LTIP units are granted to certain executive officers and senior employees of the Company as part of their compensation, and to independent directors for their service. LTIP units are valued by reference to the value of the Company s common stock and are subject to such conditions and restrictions as the compensation committee of the board of directors may determine, including continued employment or service. LTIP units granted on January 6, 2016 to independent directors, subject to the recipient s continued service, will vest on January 1, 2017. LTIP units granted on January 8, 2016 to certain senior executive officers and senior employees, subject to the recipient s continued employment, will vest quarterly over   four   years, with the first vesting date being March 31, 2016. LTIP units granted on February 22, 2016 to certain senior executive officers, subject to the recipient s continued employment, will vest quarterly over   four   years, with the first vesting date being March 31, 2016. Vested LTIP units can be converted to Other Common Units on a   one-for-one   basis once a material equity transaction has occurred that results in the accretion of the member s capital account to the economic equivalent of an Other Common Unit. All LTIP units, whether vested or not, will receive the same monthly per unit distributions as Other Common Units, which equal per share dividends on common stock.

     Table of Contents  

The LTIP units issued under the 2011 Plan were valued using the Monte Carlo lattice binomial option-pricing model at the grant date. The fair value of the LTIP units are based on Level 3 inputs and are non-recurring fair value measurements. The table below sets forth the assumptions used in valuing such LTIP units for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

On January 25, 2016, the Company and Geoffrey G. Jervis, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, agreed that Mr. Jervis s employment with the Company would terminate effective February 25, 2016. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the executive employment agreement and LTIP unit agreements between the Company and Mr. Jervis, and the Company s 2015 Outperformance Program ("OPP"), Mr. Jervis received a lump sum cash payment, the continuation of certain insurance benefits, immediate vesting of outstanding LTIP units, and eligibility to receive a pro-rated award payment under the OPP. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the expense recognition of Mr. Jervis's unvested LTIP units in the amount of approximately   $1.6 million  , which is included in general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the unrecognized compensation expense associated with Mr. Jervis's participation in the OPP after February 25, 2016 will not be recognized.  The Company also incurred approximately   $1.5 million   related to the lump sum cash payment and continuation of certain insurance benefits, which is included in general and administrative expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  The following table summarizes activity related to the Company s unvested LTIP units for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

The unrecognized compensation expense associated with the Company s LTIP units at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $7.7 million   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.6 years  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair value at vesting date for the LTIP units vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 

Other Common Units 
    
  Other Common Units and shares of the Company s common stock have essentially the same economic characteristics in that Other Common Units directly, and shares of the Company s common stock indirectly, through the Company s interest in the Operating Partnership, share equally in the total net income or loss distributions of the Operating Partnership. Subject to certain restrictions, investors who own Other Common Units have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem any or all of their Other Common Units for cash equal to the then-current value of   one   share of the Company s common stock, or, at the Company s election, shares of common stock on a   one-for-one   basis. The value of a share of common stock is calculated as the average common stock

closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for the   10   trading days immediately preceding the redemption notice date. Each Other Common Unit will receive the same monthly distribution as a share of common stock. 

8. Equity Incentive Plan 
    
  On March 8, 2016, the Company granted performance units, approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors, under the 2011 Plan to provide certain key employees of the Company with incentives designed to align those key employees' interests more closely with those of the stockholders.  
    
  The ultimate value of the performance units depends on the Company s total stockholder return ("TSR") over a   three  -year period commencing January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2018 (the "measuring period"). At the end of the   three  -year measuring period, the performance units convert into shares of common stock, or, at the Company's election and with the award recipient's consent, LTIP units or other securities, at a rate depending on the Company s TSR over the measuring period as compared to   three   different benchmarks and on the absolute amount of the Company s TSR. A recipient of performance units may receive as few as   zero   shares or as many as   250%   of the number of target units, plus deemed dividends. The target amount of the performance units is nominally allocated as: i)   25%   to the Company s TSR compared to the TSR of an industry peer group; ii)   25%   to the Company s TSR compared to the TSR of a size-based peer group; and iii)   50%   to the Company s TSR compared to the TSR of the companies in the MSCI US REIT index. 
    
  No dividends are paid to the recipient during the measuring period. At the end of the measuring period, if the Company s TSR is such that the recipient earns shares of common stock or, at the Company's election and with the award recipient's consent, LTIP units or other securities ( Award Shares ), the recipient will receive additional Award Shares relating to dividends deemed to have been paid and reinvested on the Award Shares. The Company, in the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors, may pay the cash value of the deemed dividends instead of issuing additional Award Shares. The number of Award Shares is determined at the end of the measuring period, and   one-half   of the Award Shares and all dividend shares vest immediately. The other   one-half   of the Award Shares will be restricted (subject to forfeiture) and vest   one   year after the end of the measuring period. 
    
  The fair value of the performance units at the date of grant was   $2.6 million  , as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a weighted average volatility factor of   23.0%  , a weighted average risk-free interest rate of   1.0849%  , and a weighted average expected dividend yield of   6.0%  . The performance unit equity compensation expense is recognized into earnings on a straight-line basis from the grant date over the respective vesting periods.  
    
  The unrecognized compensation expense associated with the OPP and the performance plan at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $0.6 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.3 years   and   2.7 years  , respectively.  
    
  Non-cash Compensation Expense 
    
  The following table summarizes the amount recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the amortization of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, the OPP, performance units, and the Company s board of directors  compensation.

    Inclusive of approximately   $1.6 million   of non-cash compensation expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   associated with the severance cost of an executive officer as discussed Note 7.  
              (2) 
    All of the Company s independent directors elected to receive shares of common stock in lieu of cash for their service during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The number of shares of common stock granted is calculated based on the trailing   10 days   average common stock price ending on the third business day preceding the grant date. 

9. Earnings Per Share 
    
  The Company uses the two-class method of computing earnings per common share, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid  
  
   26

or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities as these stock-based awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, unless and until a forfeiture occurs, and these awards must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were   272,337  ,   277,720  ,   275,663   and   284,020  , respectively, unvested shares of restricted stock on a weighted average basis that were considered participating securities, which were not dilutive. 
    
  The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

Overview 
    
  We are a REIT focused on the acquisition and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. We (i) identify properties that create relative value investments across all locations, single-tenant industrial property types, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol  STAG.  
    
  We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
    
  Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
    
  Our ability to increase revenues or cash flow will depend in part on our (i) external growth, specifically acquisition activity, and (ii) internal growth, specifically occupancy and rental rates on our portfolio. A variety of other factors, including those noted below, also affect our future results of operations. 
    
  Outlook 
    
  The outlook for our business remains positive, albeit on a moderated basis in light of continued slow economic growth, uncertainty of the upcoming election cycle, and continued asset appreciation. The federal funds target rate remains very low, in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Additionally, from December 31, 2015 to November 2, 2016, the 10-year treasury yield has declined from 2.27% to 1.81%. In the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve did not raise rates as it balanced its position on inflation and employment. This outcome aligns with the U.S. Federal Reserve s comments, from its rate increase in December 2015, that future rate increases will be gradual and that interest rates will likely remain historically low for an extended period of time. At the same time, its recent commentary suggests growing comfort with increasing rates again in the near future. If interest rates were to rise as a result of U.S. Federal Reserve policy action (short-term interest rates) or changes in market expectations and capital flows (long-term interest rates), we believe strengthening economic conditions are likely to accompany these changes. This strengthening of economic conditions combined with the currently favorable industrial supply-demand environment should translate to a net positive result for our business. Specifically, our existing portfolio should benefit from rising rental rates and our acquisition activity should benefit from higher yields. Furthermore, we believe certain characteristics of our business should position us well in a rising interest rate environment including the fact that we have minimal floating rate debt exposure and that many of our competitors for the assets we purchase tend to be smaller regional investors who are likely to be more heavily impacted by interest rate increases. 
    
  Other notable results and events include the continued relative strength of the U.S. dollar versus competing currencies including the euro and pound, continued low oil prices, and Brexit. A strong U.S. dollar can harm U.S. exporters and U.S. multi-nationals;

however, it can also benefit foreign multi-nationals positively which support U.S. subsidiaries that operate U.S. industrial properties. Oil price declines over the past two years and the currently sustained low price have put significant pressure on oil and gas exploration and production companies, resulting in many oil and gas sector bankruptcies, while simultaneously benefiting many industries (e.g. automotive and freight) and consumers  disposable incomes. In June, the passing of the United Kingdom s referendum to separate itself from the European Union, known as Brexit, was a major surprise to the markets. The process to renegotiate financial and economic relationships and the resulting outcomes will take many years to unfold. Right now, the decline in value of the pound is a short-term benefit to United Kingdom exporters. The long-term impacts on the U.S. and global economy are unclear. We believe our direct exposure to the United Kingdom market is limited. We believe that those of our tenants who have direct exposure to the United Kingdom, we believe they are well-diversified businesses. We will continue to monitor these trends for short-term and long-term impacts to our business.   
    
  Several economic indicators and other factors provide insight into the U.S. economic environment and industrial demand. Presently, we believe the key factors include gross domestic product ("GDP") growth rate, unemployment rate, non-farm payrolls, Conference Board consumer confidence index, manufacturing-purchasing manager index ( ISM ), the 10-year Treasury yield, U.S. total vehicle sales, and durable goods new orders. The table below summarizes recent trends in each of these factors.

    Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Conference Board, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Census Bureau, and Institute for Supply Management. Each statistic is the latest revision available at the time of publishing this report. 
              (2) 
    ISM is a composite index based on a survey of over 300 purchasing and supply executives from across the country who respond to a monthly questionnaire about changes in production, new orders, new export orders, imports, employment, inventories, prices, lead-times, and timelines of supplier deliveries in their companies. When the index is over 50, it indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 signals contraction. 
       
  Currently, the GDP growth rate, growing non-farm employment, strong U.S. total vehicle sales, ISM level, consumer confidence, and low interest rates are positive fundamental signs for industrial demand. Expanding job count and the ongoing low unemployment rate suggests consumers will be spending more money on goods in the foreseeable future. At the end of September, the consumer confidence index reached its highest level since the Great Recession. On the negative side, the speculative grade corporate default rate is expected to surpass its long-term average in 2016 driven by oil and gas and mining industry defaults. We also note that automotive sales declined year-over-year in September and we are seeing many large multinational companies experience weak organic growth, commonly due to negative currency effects and commodity price deflation. We believe these signal some caution in underlying economic strength, however, we still expect an increase in industrial activity and more demand for industrial space in the foreseeable future given the job growth, low-interest rate environment, and GDP growth. 
    
  Several industrial specific trends contribute to the expected demand increase, including: 

an increasing attractiveness of the U.S. as a manufacturing and distribution location because of the size of the U.S. consumer market, an increase in overseas labor costs and the overall cost of supplying and shipping goods (i.e. the shortening and fattening of the supply chain); 
                
    the overall quality of the transportation infrastructure in the U.S.; and  
                
    the rise of e-commerce (as compared to the traditional retail store distribution model) and the concomitant demand by e-commerce industry participants for well-located, functional distribution space. 
       
  Furthermore, the lack of material speculative development in most of our markets and the broader failure of supply to keep pace with demand in many of our markets may improve occupancy levels and rental rates in our owned portfolio. We believe, however, that industrial supply, more so than other real estate property types, has historically had a short lead time and can develop quickly. We have started to see a notable increase in development activity in a growing number of active industrial markets, but this has yet to take firm hold on a broader scale. We will continue to monitor the supply demand fundamentals for industrial real estate and assess its impact on our business.

Conditions in Our Markets 
    
  The buildings in our portfolio are located in markets throughout the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, new supply, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and other factors in these markets may affect our overall performance. 
    
  Rental Income 
    
  We receive income primarily in the form of rental income from the tenants who occupy our buildings. The amount of rental income generated by the buildings in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy and rental rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Operating Portfolio was approximately   96.4%   leased and our lease rates as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") on new and renewal leases together grew approximately   16.4%   and   6.8%   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.   We define our Operating Portfolio as including all warehouse and light manufacturing assets and excluding non-core flex/office assets and assets under redevelopment. The Operating Portfolio also excludes billboard, parking lot and cell tower leases.   Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our buildings. Our ability to lease our properties and the attendant rental rate is dependent upon, among other things, (i) the overall economy, (ii) the supply/demand dynamic in our markets, (iii) the quality of our properties, including age, clear height, and configuration, and (iv) our tenants  ability to meet their contractual obligations to us. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of our Operating Portfolio leases executed during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Certain leases contain rental concessions; any such rental concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 

(1) 
    We define Cash Basis Rent Change as the ratio of the change in base rent (excluding straight-line rent adjustments and above/below market lease amortization as required by GAAP) of the Comparable Lease.   We define a Comparable Lease as a lease with a similar lease structure as compared to the previous in-place lease, excluding new leases for space that was not occupied under our ownership, leases on space with downtime in excess of two years, and leases with materially different lease structures. 
              (2) 
    We define GAAP Rent Change as the change in the average base rent over the contractual lease term (excluding above/below market lease amortization) of the Comparable Lease. 
              (3) 
    We define Turnover Costs as the costs for improvements of vacant and renewal spaces, as well as the commissions for leasing transactions. Turnover Costs per square foot represent the total turnover costs expected to be incurred on the leases signed during the period and do not reflect actual expenditures for the period. 
              (4) 
    We define Weighted Average Lease Term as the contractual lease term in years as of the lease start date weighted by square footage. Weighted Average Lease Term related to acquired assets reflects the remaining lease term in years as of the acquisition date weighted by square footage. 
              (5) 
    Represents the total concession (free rent) for the entire lease term. 
              (6) 
    We define a New Lease as any lease that is signed for an initial term equal to or greater than twelve months for any vacant space; this includes a new tenant or an existing tenant that is expanding into new (additional) space.   
              (7) 
    We define a Renewal Lease as a lease signed by an existing tenant to extend the term for twelve months or more, including (i) a renewal of the same space as the current lease at lease expiration, (ii) a renewal of only a portion of the current space at lease expiration and (iii) an early renewal or workout, which ultimately does extend the original term for twelve months or more, but the renewal term commences before the lease expiration of their current lease.  
              (8) 
    We define a Temporary Lease or a License Agreement as any lease that is signed for an initial term of less than twelve months; this includes short-term new leases and short-term renewal leases.

Property Operating Expenses 
    
  Our rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, management fees, insurance and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of our tenants, our rental expenses are controlled, in part, by the triple net provisions in tenant leases. In our triple net leases, the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term, including utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. However, we also have modified gross leases and gross leases in our building portfolio. The terms of those leases vary and on some occasions we may absorb building related expenses of our tenants. In our modified gross leases, we are responsible for some building related expenses during the lease term, but the cost of most of the expenses is passed through to the tenant for reimbursement to us. In our gross leases, we are responsible for all costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term. Our overall performance will be affected by the extent to which we are able to pass-through rental expenses to our tenants. 
    
  Scheduled Lease Expirations 
    
  Our ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual buildings. Leases that comprise approximately   9.7%   of our annualized base rental revenue will expire during the period from   October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017  , excluding month to month leases. We assume, based upon internal renewal probability estimates that some of our tenants will renew and others will vacate and the associated space will be re-let subject to downtime assumptions. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that the rental rates on the respective new leases will generally be lower than the rates under existing leases expiring during the period   October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017  , thereby resulting in lower revenue from the same space. 
    
  The following table and chart set forth a summary of lease expirations for leases in place as of   September 30, 2016  , plus available space, for each of the ten calendar years beginning with 2016 and thereafter in our portfolio. The information in the table and chart assumes that tenants exercise no renewal options and no early termination rights. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , for the period   October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017  , none of our top ten leases based on   September 30, 2016   annualized base rental revenue will be expiring.

  The following table summarizes the acquisitions during the   nine   months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

Portfolio Dispositions 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   14   buildings comprised of approximately   2.0 million   square feet with a net book value of   $28.7 million   to third parties. These buildings contributed   $2.5 million   to revenue and   $0.4 million   to   net income (exclusive of loss on impairments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on the sales of rental property, net)   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net proceeds from the sales of rental property were approximately   $50.3 million   and we recognized a gain on the sales of rental property, net of approximately   $21.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  All of the dispositions were accounted for under the full accrual method.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Rental Property 
    
  We capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment or improvement of rental property. Real estate taxes, compensation costs of development personnel, insurance, interest, and other directly related costs during construction periods are capitalized as incurred and depreciated commencing with the date the property is substantially completed. Such costs begin to be capitalized to the development projects from the point we are undergoing the necessary activities to get the development ready for its intended use and cease when the development projects are substantially completed and held available for occupancy. Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate of our unsecured indebtedness during the period. 
    
  Incentive and Equity-Based Employee Compensation Plans 
    
  In March of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of cash flow. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2016. As a result, our policy is to recognize forfeitures in the period which they occur, whereas the former guidance required us to estimate expected forfeitures. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Our results of operations are largely driven by our levels of occupancy as well as the rental rates we receive from tenants. From a rental rate standpoint, we have historically achieved overall rental increases in our tenant rollovers on a cash basis and GAAP basis. 
    
  The following discussion of our results of our same store net operating income ( NOI ) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  below. We consider our same store portfolio to consist of only those buildings owned and operated at the beginning and at the end of both of the applicable periods presented.  Same store results are considered to be useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in building-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions or dispositions. However, because we have generally acquired 100% occupied properties and grown the portfolio significantly every year since our initial public offering, our same store results do not represent a market portfolio with market occupancy. Because we have above market occupancy, our same store results may look unfavorable at times as we trend to market levels. We encourage the reader to not only look at our same store results, but also our total portfolio results, due to historic and future growth. 
    
  Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our results of operations are affected by the acquisition and disposition activity during the   2016   and   2015   periods as described below. The following discussion of our same store portfolio excludes flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and those classified as held for sale on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. On   September 30, 2016  , we owned   228   industrial buildings consisting of   45.8 million   square feet, which represents approximately   78.2%   of our total portfolio, that are considered our same store portfolio in the analysis below. Same store occupancy decreased approximately   0.8%   to   95.9%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   96.7%   as of   September 30, 2015  .

Same Store Total Operating Revenue 
    
  Same store operating revenue consists primarily of (i) rental income consisting of base rent, termination income, straight-line rent and above and below market lease amortization from our properties, and (ii) tenant reimbursements for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( tenant recoveries ). 
    
  Net loss   for our total portfolio decreased by   $4.3 million   or   91.4%   to   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $4.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio to net income, see the table on the previous page. 
    
  Same store rental income   increased   by   $0.4 million   or   0.9%   to   $42.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $42.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Approximately $1.2 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants. Same store rental income also increased approximately $0.1 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. These increases were partially offset by an approximately $0.9 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies. 
    
  Same store tenant recoveries   increased   by   $0.4 million   or   6.7%   to   $7.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $6.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to increases in occupancy and real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority.  
    
  Same Store Operating Expenses 
    
  Same store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance. 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio to net income, see the table on the previous page.  
    
  Total same store expenses   decreased   by   $0.3 million   or   3.9%   to   $8.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to a gain on involuntary conversion of approximately $0.2 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to expenses previously recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2016 related a mold remediation and restoration project at one of our buildings, where we received acknowledgment from our insurance carrier that we will be receiving insurance proceeds to reimburse our expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Acquisitions     and Dispositions     Net Operating Income 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions portfolio to net income, see the table on the previous page. 
    
  Subsequent to   July 1, 2015  , we acquired   55   buildings consisting of approximately   11.4 million   square feet, and sold   20   buildings consisting of approximately   2.8 million   square feet. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the buildings acquired after   July 1, 2015   contributed approximately   $8.4 million   and   $1.2 million   to NOI, respectively. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the buildings sold after   July 1, 2015   contributed approximately   $0.3 million   and   $1.5 million   to NOI, respectively. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold. 
    
  Other Net Operating Income 
    
  Our other assets include our flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and buildings classified as held for sale. It also includes corporate sublease rental income and asset management fee income, which are separated for purposes of calculating NOI for the total portfolio. 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and buildings classified as held for sale to net income, see the table on the previous page. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   we owned 15 flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.9 million square feet,   one   redevelopment building consisting of approximately   0.3 million   square feet, and   one   building consisting of approximately   0.1 million   square feet was classified as held for sale. These building contributed approximately $1.4 million and $2.1 million to NOI for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Additionally, we earned   $0  ,   $0.1 million  ,   $0.1 million  , and   $0.1

million   in corporate sublease rental income and asset management fee income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Total Other Expenses  
    
  Total other expenses consist of general and administrative expense, property acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses. 
    
  Total other expenses   decreased     $0.2 million   or   0.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $41.9 million   compared to   $42.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily related to a decrease of   $5.7 million   in loss on impairments recorded due to the impairment of three buildings for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to no impairments during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This decrease was partially offset by an increase of   $3.4 million   in depreciation and amortization as a result of buildings acquired which increased the depreciable asset base. General and administrative expenses also had an increase of   $1.2 million  , primarily related to non-cash compensation expense related to the 2016 equity grants for employees and independent directors. Additionally, property acquisition costs increased   $1.0 million  , primarily attributable to transfer taxes levied in certain states for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Total Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Total other income (expense) consists of interest income, interest expense, and gain on the sales of rental property. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt. 
    
  Total other income (expense) increased   $2.3 million   or   29.7%   to a net other expense of   $9.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately   $1.2 million   related to the increase in total average debt outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Comparison of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our results of operations are affected by the acquisition and disposition activity during the   2016   and   2015   periods as described below. The following discussion of our same store portfolio excludes flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and those classified as held for sale on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. On   September 30, 2016   we owned   211   industrial buildings consisting of   42.7 million   square feet, which represents approximately   72.9%   of our total portfolio, that are considered our same store portfolio in the analysis below. Same store occupancy decreased approximately   1.1%   to   95.6%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   96.7%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The following table summarizes selected operating information for our same store portfolio and our total portfolio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   (dollars in thousands). This table includes a reconciliation from our same store portfolio to our total portfolio by also providing information for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   with respect to the buildings acquired and disposed of after   January 1, 2015   and our flex/office and held for sale buildings.

Same Store Total Operating Revenue 
    
  Same store operating revenue consists primarily of (i) rental income consisting of base rent, termination income, straight-line rent and above and below market lease amortization from our properties, and (ii) tenant reimbursements for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( tenant recoveries ). 
    
  Net income (loss)   for our total portfolio increased by   $12.3 million   or   108.2%   to net income of   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a net loss of   $11.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio to net income (loss), see the table on the previous page. 
    
  Same store rental income   increased   by   $1.0 million   or   0.9%   to   $115.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $114.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Approximately $3.5 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants. Same store rental income also increased approximately $0.3 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. These increases were partially offset by an approximately $2.8 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies. 
    
  Same store tenant recoveries   increased   by   $0.7 million   or   3.7%   to   $18.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $18.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is primarily related to an increase of approximately $1.5 million related to increases of real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority, occupancy in previously vacant buildings, as well in changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes directly to the taxing authority. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.8 million related to decreases of real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority and vacancies. 
    
  Same Store Operating Expenses 
    
  Same store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance. 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio to net income, see the table on the previous page. 
    
  Total same store expenses   decreased   by   $(0.2) million   or   0.8%   to   $23.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $23.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is primarily related to a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in snow removal expenses attributable to a more mild winter in 2016 as compared to 2015, as well as a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in general repairs and maintenance expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.2 million related to increases of real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes directly to the taxing authority. 
    
  Acquisitions     and Dispositions     Net Operating Income 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions portfolio to net income, see the table on the previous page. 
    
  Subsequent to   January 1, 2015  , we acquired   72   buildings consisting of approximately   14.5 million   square feet, and sold   20   buildings consisting of approximately   2.8 million   square feet. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the buildings acquired after   January 1, 2015   contributed approximately   $30.7 million   and   $8.1 million   to NOI, respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the buildings sold after   January 1, 2015   contributed approximately   $1.5 million   and   $4.0 million   to NOI, respectively. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold. 
    
  Other Net Operating Income 
    
  Our other assets include our flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and buildings classified as held for sale. It also includes corporate sublease rental income and asset management fee income, which are separated for purposes of calculating NOI for the total portfolio. 
    
  For a detailed reconciliation of our flex/office buildings, redevelopment buildings, and buildings classified as held for sale to net income, see the table on the previous page.

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   we owned 15 flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.9 million square feet,   one   redevelopment building consisting of approximately   0.3 million   square feet, and   one   building consisting of approximately   0.1 million   square feet was classified as held for sale. These buildings contributed approximately $4.5 million and $6.6 million to NOI for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Additionally, we earned   $0  ,   $0.2 million  ,   $0.2 million  , and   $0.3 million   in corporate sublease rental income and asset management fee income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Total Other Expenses  
    
  Total other expenses consist of general and administrative expense, property acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses. 
    
  Total other expenses   increased     $19.6 million   or   17.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $134.9 million   compared to   $115.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily related to an increase of   $11.3 million   in depreciation and amortization as a result of buildings acquired which increased the depreciable asset base. The increase was also attributable to an increase of   $2.9 million   in loss on impairments recorded due to the impairment of nine buildings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the impairment of four buildings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Approximately   $4.9 million   of the increase relates to an increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to compensation expense of approximately $3.1 million related to the severance costs of a former executive officer during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as well as the   2016   equity grants for employees and independent directors. This increase is also attributable to an increase in property acquisition costs of   $0.6 million  , primarily attributable to transfer taxes levied in certain states for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Total Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Total other income (expense) consists of interest income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on the sales of rental property. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt. 
    
  Total other income (expense) decreased   $12.3 million   or   50.2%   to a net other expense of   $12.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $24.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is primarily the result of an increase in the gain on the sales of rental property of approximately   $19.9 million   due to the sales of 14 buildings, whereas there were two rental property sales during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   $2.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , whereas there was no loss on extinguishment of debt during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was also partially offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately   $5.6 million   related to the increase in total average debt outstanding for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In this report, we disclose and discuss funds from operations ( FFO ) and NOI, which meet the definition of  non-GAAP financial measures  as set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. 
    
  Funds From Operations 
    
  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, FFO should be compared with our reported net income or net loss in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). FFO represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating buildings, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
    
  Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs. FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. 

43 

     Table of Contents  

However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our buildings that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our buildings, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs  FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. 
    
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. 

Net Operating Income 
    
  We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because we believe it helps investors and management understand the core operations of our buildings. NOI is defined as rental revenue, including reimbursements, less property expenses and real estate taxes and insurance. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. 
    
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our NOI for the periods presented to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. 

Cash Flows 
    
  Comparison of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

44 

     Table of Contents  

Net cash provided by operating activities     increased     $7.8 million   to   $97.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $90.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after   September 30, 2015  , and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after   September 30, 2015  , fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts, and a higher cash interest paid due to an increase in our total average indebtedness outstanding. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities     decreased     $24.8 million   to   $220.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $244.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily related to the sale of   14   buildings during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for net proceeds of approximately   $50.3 million  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   where we sold 2 buildings for net proceeds of approximately   $9.2 million  . This was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for additions of land and building improvements of approximately   $10.7 million  , primarily due to a tenant improvements project and the expansion of a building. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities     decreased     $21.0 million   to   $122.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $143.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change is primarily due to a decrease in cash inflow from our unsecured notes of   $120.0 million   from the issuance of the $100 million 4.32% Series D 10-year unsecured notes and the $20 million 4.42% Series E 12-year unsecured notes on February 20, 2015. The change is also attributable to an increase of repayment of mortgage notes of   $17.7 million  , an increase of   $3.0 million   in offering costs related to the issuance of the 6.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock") on March 17, 2016 and a new at-the-market common stock offering program on May 13, 2016, and an increase in dividends and distributions paid of   $8.3 million   as a result of the increased number of shares and units outstanding as well as a   $0.026664   increase in the dividend paid per share during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases are were offset by the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock for proceeds of   $75.0 million  , an increase of net cash inflow of   $26.3 million   from our unsecured credit facility, and an increase in proceeds from sales of common stock of   $25.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations, disposition proceeds, and financing activities. Operating cash flow is primarily rental income, expense recoveries from tenants, and other income from operations and is our principal source of funds that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We look to the capital markets (common equity, preferred equity, and debt) to primarily fund our acquisition activity. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our buildings that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from building sales and debt and equity financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term and medium-term liquidity needs. 
    
  Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our buildings, including interest expense, interest rate swap payments, scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, funding of property acquisitions under contract, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
    
  Our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to recurring short-term liquidity needs as discussed above, consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, non-recurring capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity or debt securities, other borrowings, property dispositions, or, in connection with acquisitions of certain additional buildings, the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total immediate liquidity of approximately   $479.8 million  , comprised of   $12.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents and   $467.5 million   of immediate availability on our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans.  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

In addition, we require funds for future dividends to be paid to our common and preferred stockholders and common unit holders in our Operating Partnership. The table below sets forth the dividends attributable to our common stock that were declared or paid during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These distributions on our common stock are voluntary (at the discretion of our board of directors), to the extent we have satisfied distribution requirements in order to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes, and may be reduced or stopped if needed to fund other liquidity requirements or for other reasons. 

On   November 2, 2016  , our board of directors declared the common stock dividend for the months ending   January 31, 2017  ,   February 28, 2017   and   March 31, 2017   at a monthly rate of   $0.116667   per share of common stock. 
    
  We pay quarterly cumulative dividends on the 9.0% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred Stock ), the 6.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series B Preferred Stock ), and the Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Preferred Stock Issuances") at a rate equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $2.25, $1.65625, and $1.71875 per share, respectively.   Dividends on the     Series C Preferred Stock were accrued and cumulative from and including the issuance date of March 17, 2016 to the first payment date on June 30, 2016. The table below sets forth the dividends on the Preferred Stock Issuances during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

On   November 2, 2016  , our board of directors declared the Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock dividend for the quarter ending   December 31, 2016   at a quarterly rate of   $0.4140625   per share and   $0.4296875   per share, respectively.  
    
  On     November 2, 2016  , we redeemed all of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a cash redemption price of   $25.00   per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date, without interest, at a rate of   $0.19375   per share.

Indebtedness Outstanding 
    
  The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our indebtedness outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(1) 
    Current interest rate as of   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the one-month LIBOR ( L ) was   0.53111%  . The current interest rate is not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums. The spread over the applicable rate for our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans is based on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the respective loan agreements. 
              (2) 
    Prepayment terms consist of (i) pre-payable with no penalty; (ii) pre-payable with penalty; (iii) pre-payable without penalty   three   months prior to the maturity date; (iv) pre-payable without penalty   two   months prior to the maturity date; (v) pre-payable without penalty   three   months prior to the maturity date, however can be defeased; (vi) pre-payable without penalty   six   months prior to the maturity date; and (vii) pre-payable without penalty   three   months prior to the maturity date, however can be defeased beginning January 1, 2016.  
              (3) 
    The capacity of the unsecured credit facility is   $450.0 million  .  
               (5) 
    The weighted average interest rate was calculated using the fixed interest rate swapped on the current notional amount of   $450.0 million   of debt, and is not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums. 
       
  The aggregate undrawn nominal commitments on the combined   unsecured credit facility   and   unsecured term loans   as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $467.5 million  . Our actual borrowing capacity at any given point in time may be less and is restricted to a maximum amount based on our debt covenant compliance.  
    
  Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants.

The chart below details our debt capital structure as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(1) 
    We define Net Debt is defined as our amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes, less cash and cash equivalents.   We define Real Estate Cost Basis as the book value of rental property and deferred leasing intangibles, exclusive of the related accumulated depreciation and amortization.  
       
  We regularly pursue new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position. As a result of these dedicated efforts, we are confident in our ability to meet future debt maturities and building acquisition funding needs. We believe that our current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing, despite possible volatility in the credit markets. 
    
  Our interest rate exposure as it relates to interest expense payments on our floating rate debt is managed through our use of interest rate swaps, which fix the rate of our long term floating rate debt. For a detailed discussion on our use of interest rate swaps, see  Interest Rate Risk  below. 
    
  Equity 
    
  Preferred Stock 
    
  On March 17, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of   3,000,000   shares of   6.875%   Series C Preferred Stock,   $0.01   par value per share, at a price to the public of   $25.00   per share. The table below sets forth our outstanding Preferred Stock Issuances as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The Preferred Stock Issuances rank on parity and ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and     rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The Preferred Stock Issuances have no stated maturity date and are not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. Generally, we are not permitted to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock prior to November 2, 2016, April 16, 2018, and March 17, 2021, respectively, except in limited circumstances relating to our ability to qualify as a REIT and in certain other circumstances related to a change of control. 
    
  On     November 2, 2016  , we redeemed all of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a cash redemption price of   $25.00   per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date, without interest, at a rate of $0.19375 per share.

Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we sold   3,124,700   shares under the 2016 $200 million ATM common stock offering program for gross proceeds of   $71.1 million  . The net proceeds of   $70.2 million   were used to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility. 
    
  Noncontrolling Interest 
    
  We own our interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned approximately   95.2%   of the common units of our Operating Partnership, and our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common units in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining   4.8%  . 
    
  Non-cash Compensation Expense 
    
  We recorded approximately   $5.8 million   in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for the amortization of our equity incentive plan, excluding severance costs and board of directors' compensation. We expect to recognize approximately   $7.8 million   for the year ending December 31,   2016   for the amortization of our equity incentive plan, excluding severance costs and board of directors compensation. The following table summarizes the expected amortization of our unrecognized compensation expense over the next five years as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We use interest rate swaps to fix the rate of our variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our outstanding variable rate debt was fixed with interest rate swaps. 
    
  We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss, which is a component of equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense.  
    
  We have established criteria for suitable counterparties in relation to various specific types of risk. We only use counterparties that have a credit rating of no lower than investment grade at swap inception from Moody s Investor Services, Standard   Poor s, or Fitch Ratings or other nationally recognized rating agencies.

     Table of Contents  

The following table details our outstanding interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The swaps outlined in the above table were all designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, and all are valued as Level 2 financial instruments. Level 2 financial instruments are defined as significant other observable inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of all of our   23   interest rate swaps were in a liability position of approximately   $16.0 million  , including any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $429.0 million   of variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our outstanding variable rate debt was fixed with interest rate swaps.  To the extent interest rates increase, interest costs on our floating rate debt not fixed with interest rate swaps will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 
    
  Inflation 
    
  Our business could be impacted in multiple ways due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Specifically, our weighted average lease term is approximately   4.1 years   and, on average, 10-20% of our leases will roll annually over the next few years. We expect that this lease roll will allows us to capture inflationary increases in rent on a relatively efficient basis. In addition, we have long term liabilities averaging approximately 6.0     years when excluding our unsecured credit facility. Our variable rate debt has been fully swapped to fixed rates through maturity with the exception of the unsecured credit facility. Therefore, as rents rise and increase our operating cash flow, this positive impact will flow more directly to the bottom line without the offset of higher in place debt costs. Lastly, while inflation will likely lead to increases in the operating costs of our portfolio, such as real estate taxes, utility expenses, and other operating expenses, the majority of our leases are either triple net leases or otherwise provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to these expenses. Therefore, the increased costs in an inflationary environment would generally be passed through to our tenant.  
    
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3.  Quantitative     and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The primary market risk we are exposed to is interest rate risk.  We have used derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings, primarily through interest rate swaps. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our variable rate interest debt was fixed with interest rate swaps. To the extent we undertake additional variable rate indebtedness, if interest rates increase, then so will the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under GAAP. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we have evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures for the periods covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by our Company in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls 
    
  There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
