  The use of the words  we,   us  or  our  refers to Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, except where the context otherwise requires. 
   
  1. Organization and Description of Business    
  Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated on   January 23, 2015   and therefore we consider that our date of inception. We were initially capitalized on   February 6, 2015  . We invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We may also originate and acquire secured loans and real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income. We intend to elect to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. 
  On February 16, 2016, we commenced our initial public offering, or our offering, in which we were offering to the public a minimum of   $2,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock, or the minimum offering, and a maximum of   $3,000,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock in our primary offering at a purchase price of   $10.00   per share. Effective June 17, 2016, we reallocated certain of the unsold shares being offered, such that we are currently offering up to approximately   $2,800,000,000   in shares of Class T common stock at a price of   $10.00   per share and   $200,000,000   in shares of Class I common stock at a price of   $9.30   per share in our primary offering, and up to   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, at a purchase price of   $9.50   per share, aggregating up to   $3,150,000,000  , or the maximum offering. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the primary offering and the DRIP, and among classes of stock. 
  The conditions of our minimum offering were satisfied on April 12, 2016, and we admitted our initial public subscribers as stockholders, excluding shares purchased by residents of Ohio, Washington and Pennsylvania (who were subject to higher minimum offering amounts). Having raised the minimum offering, the offering proceeds were released by the escrow agent to us on April 13, 2016 and were made available for the acquisition of properties and other purposes as disclosed in our prospectus dated February 16, 2016, or our prospectus, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC (provided that subscriptions from residents of Ohio, Washington and Pennsylvania were to continue to be held in escrow until we had received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least   $10,000,000  ,   $20,000,000   and   $150,000,000  , respectively). The conditions of our minimum offering in Ohio and Washington were satisfied on June 14, 2016 and July 8, 2016, respectively, and as of such dates we were able to admit Ohio and Washington subscribers as stockholders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for   5,374,861   aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or approximately   $53,443,000  , excluding subscriptions from residents in Pennsylvania (who will not be admitted as stockholders until we have received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least   $150,000,000  ) and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP.  
  We conduct substantially all of our operations through Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership. We are externally advised by Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, LLC, or Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, or our advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement, or the Advisory Agreement, between us and our advisor that has a   one  -year term that expires on February 16, 2017 and is subject to successive   one  -year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties. Our advisor uses its best efforts, subject to the oversight and review of our board of directors, to, among other things, research, identify, review and make investments in and dispositions of properties and securities on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Our advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as our fiduciary.   Our a  dvisor is   75.0%   owned and managed by American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or American Healthcare Investors, and   25.0%   owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Corporation, or Griffin Capital, or collectively, our co-sponsors. Effective March 1, 2015, American Healthcare Investors is   47.1%   owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC, or AHI Group Holdings,   45.1%   indirectly owned by NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), or NSAM, and   7.8%   owned by James F. Flaherty III, one of NSAM s partners. NSAM has announced its intention to merge with Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE:CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) to form a new combined company, Colony NorthStar, Inc. The proposed merger is subject to substantial closing conditions, including the required approval from each respective company s stockholders, governmental and regulatory agencies and third parties. We are not affiliated with Griffin Capital, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, or Griffin Capital Securities, or our dealer manager, NSAM, Mr. Flaherty, Colony Capital, Inc. or NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.; however, we are affiliated with Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, American Healthcare Investors and AHI Group Holdings.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed   five   property acquisitions comprising   five   buildings, or approximately   211,000   square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of   $59,670,000  .  
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership and the wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, as well as any variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and of which we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 810,   Consolidation  , or ASC Topic 810. 
  We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, or wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, will own substantially all of the properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of o  ur operating partnership, and as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned greater than a   99.99%   and a   99.00%   general partnership interest, respectively, therein. Our advisor is a limited partner, and as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our advisor owned less than a   0.01%   and a   1.00%   noncontrolling limited partnership interest, respectively, in our operating partnership.  
  Because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership), the accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Interim Unaudited Financial Data  
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable.  
  In preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events through the financial statement issuance date. We believe that although the disclosures contained herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash 
  Cash consists of all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. 
  Restricted Cash Held in Escrow 
  Restricted cash held in escrow of   $45,000   as of   September 30, 2016   is not included in our assets in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash held in escrow consists of funds received in connection with subscription agreements from residents of Pennsylvania to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our offering. Such funds were held in an escrow account and will not be released to or available to us until we raise the minimum offering of   $150,000,000   required by the state of Pennsylvania. 
  Revenue Recognition, Tenant Receivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts  
  We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , or ASC Topic 605. ASC Topic 605 requires that all four of the following basic criteria be met before revenue is realized or realizable and earned: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Tenant receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that collectability is not reasonably assured, and thus such revenue is recognized using the cash basis method. 
  In accordance with ASC Topic 840,   Leases  , minimum annual rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Differences between real estate revenue recognized and cash amounts contractually due from tenants under the lease agreements are recorded to deferred rent receivable or deferred rent liability, as applicable. Tenant reimbursement revenue, which comprises additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with ASC Subtopic 605-45,   Revenue Recognition   Principal Agent Consideration  , or ASC Subtopic 605-45. ASC Subtopic 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We recognize lease termination fees at such time when there is a signed termination letter agreement, all of the conditions of such agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property.  
  Tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain tenants to meet the contractual obligations under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rent receivables arising from the straight line recognition of rents. Such allowances are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the tenant s financial condition, security deposits, letters of credit, lease guarantees, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any allowances for uncollectible accounts.  
  Real Estate Investments, Net  
  We carry our operating properties at our historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of operating properties includes the cost of land and completed buildings and related improvements. Expenditures that increase the service life of properties are capitalized and the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. The cost of buildings and capital improvements is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and capital improvements, up to   39 years  , and the cost for tenant improvements is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life, up to   fourteen years  . Furniture, fixtures and equipment, if any, is depreciated over the estimated useful life, up to   10 years  . When depreciable property is retired, replaced or disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.  
  As part of the leasing process, we may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event we are not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease inducement and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well

as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs,   e.g  ., unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process. Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease. Recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements when we are the owner of the leasehold improvements. However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date (and the date on which recognition of lease revenue commences) is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets  
  We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.  
  If impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare the estimated fair value to the intangible asset s carrying value. We recognize any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any impairment losses. 
  Property Acquisitions 
  In accordance with ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , or ASC Topic 805, we, with assistance from independent valuation specialists, measure the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities, as applicable, based on their respective fair values for acquired properties. Our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings, land, leasehold interests, furniture, fixtures and equipment, above- or below-market rent, in-place leases, master leases, above- or below-market debt assumed and derivative financial instruments assumed. These estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. In addition, we amortize the value assigned to above- or below-market rent as a component of revenue, unlike in-place leases and other intangibles, which we include in depreciation and amortization in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  The determination of the fair value of land is based upon comparable sales data. In cases where a leasehold interest in the land is acquired, the value of the leasehold interest is determined by discounting the difference between the contract ground lease payments and a market ground lease payment back to a present value as of the acquisition date. The market ground lease payment is estimated as a percentage of the land value. The fair value of buildings is based upon our determination of the value as if it were to be replaced and vacant using cost data and discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by us include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. We also recognize the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment on the premises, if any, as well as the above- or below-market rent, the value of in-place leases, master leases, above- or below-market debt and derivative financial instruments assumed.  
  The value of the above- or below-market component of the acquired in-place leases is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between: (i) the level payment equivalent of the contract rent paid pursuant to the lease; and (ii) our estimate of market rent payments taking into account rent steps throughout the lease. In the case of leases with options, a case-by-case analysis is performed based on all facts and circumstances of the specific lease to determine whether the option will be assumed to be exercised. The amounts related to above-market leases are included in identified intangible assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to real estate revenue over the remaining non-cancelable lease term of the acquired leases with each property. The amounts related to below-market leases are included in identified intangible liabilities, net in our

accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to real estate revenue over the remaining non-cancelable lease term plus any below-market renewal options of the acquired leases with each property.  
  The value of in-place lease costs, if any, are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenants. Characteristics considered by us in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. The net amounts related to in-place lease costs are included in identified intangible assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the average downtime of the acquired leases with each property. The net amounts related to the value of tenant relationships, if any, would be included in identified intangible assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and would be amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the average remaining non-cancelable lease term of the acquired leases plus the market renewal lease term. The value of a master lease, if any, in which a previous owner or a tenant is relieved of specific rental obligations as additional space is leased, is determined by discounting the expected real estate revenue associated with the master lease space over the assumed lease-up period.  
  The value of above- or below-market debt, if any, is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage at the time of assumption. The net value of above- or below-market debt is included in mortgage loan payable, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the assumed mortgage.  
  The value of derivative financial instruments, if any, is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , or ASC Topic 820, and is included in derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  The values of contingent consideration assets and liabilities, if any, are analyzed at the time of acquisition. For contingent purchase options, the fair market value of the acquired asset is compared to the specified option price at the exercise date. If the option price is below market, it is assumed to be exercised and the difference between the fair market value and the option price is discounted to the present value at the time of acquisition.  
  These values are preliminary estimates in nature and subject to adjustments, which could be material. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. 
  Fair Value Measurements  
  We follow ASC Topic 820 to account for the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements  , for a further discussion.

Real Estate Deposits  
  Real estate deposits include funds held by escrow agents and others to be applied towards the purchase of real estate. 
  Other Assets, Net 
  Other assets consist of deferred financing costs on the Line of Credit, as defined in   Note 7, Line of Credit  , prepaid expenses and deposits and deferred rent receivables. Deferred financing costs on the Line of Credit include amounts paid to lenders and others to obtain financing. Such costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related loan, which approximates the effective interest rate method. Amortization of deferred financing costs on the Line of Credit is included in interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prepaid expenses are amortized over the related contract periods.  
  See Note 5, Other Assets, Net  , for a further discussion. 
  Stock Compensation 
  We follow ASC Topic 718,   Compensation       Stock Compensation  , or ASC Topic 718, to account for our stock compensation pursuant to the 2015 Incentive Plan, or our incentive plan, and the 2015 Independent Directors Compensation Plan.   See Note 11, Equity     2015 Incentive Plan and Independent Directors Compensation Plan, for a further discussion of grants under such plans. 
  Income Taxes 
  We have not yet elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, and we intend to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. To qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least   90.0%   of our annual ordinary taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.  
  If we fail to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to elect to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse affect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Because of our intention to elect REIT status for our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, we did not benefit from the loss incurred for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We follow ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes  , to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any tax benefits nor liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Segment Disclosure 
  ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting  , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about a public entity s reportable segments. We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have determined that we operate through   one   reportable business segment, with activities related to investing in medical office buildings. 
  Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , or ASU 2014-09, which replaces the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 provides a five-step framework to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Since its issuance, the FASB has amended several aspects of ASU 2014-09, including provisions that address principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and identifying performance obligations. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. It may be adopted either by restating all years presented in the financial statements or by recording the

impact of adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,   or ASU 2015-02, which amends the consolidation analysis required under ASC Topic 810. Specifically, ASU 2015-02: (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities; (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; and (iii) amends the effect of fee arrangements in the primary beneficiary determination. Further, the application of ASU 2015-02 permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption approach. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   or ASU 2015-03, which amends the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of such costs is required to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  , or ASU 2015-15, which clarified that debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements may continue to be presented as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangemen  t. T  he application of ASU 2015-03 requires retrospective adjustment of all prior periods presented. ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   or ASU 2015-16, which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in a business combination. The cumulative effect of a measurement period adjustment as a result of a change in the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date, is required to be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined, rather than retrospectively. Further, ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in the current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , or ASU 2016-01, which amends the classification and measurement of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 revises the accounting related to: (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities; and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, with respect to only certain of the amendments in ASU 2016-01, for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2016-01 requires the application of the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with certain exceptions. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , or ASU 2016-02, which amends the guidance on accounting for leases, including extensive amendments to the disclosure requirements. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under ASU 2016-02, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest

comparative period presented in the financial statements. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   or ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 requires disclosures about a change in accounting principle under ASC 250,   Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,   in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   or ASU 2016-13, which introduces a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2018. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   or ASU 2016-15, which intends to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,   or ASU 2016-16, which removes the prohibition in ASC 740,   Income Taxes  , against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-16 on January 1, 2018 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  , or ASU 2016-17, which amends the consolidation requirements that apply to a single decision maker s evaluation of interests held through related parties that are under common control when it is determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-17 on December 15, 2016 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

7. Line of Credit    
  On August 25, 2016, we, through our operating partnership, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, and us, collectively as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, as administrative agent, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer; and KeyBank, National Association, or KeyBank, as syndication agent and letters of credit issuer, to obtain a revolving line of credit with an aggregate maximum principal amount of   $100,000,000  , or the Line of Credit, subject to certain terms and conditions.  
  On August 25, 2016, we also entered into separate revolving notes, or the Revolving Notes, with each of Bank of America and KeyBank, whereby we promised to pay the principal amount of each revolving loan and accrued interest to the respective lender or its registered assigns, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of loans made under the Line of Credit may be used for general working capital (including acquisitions), capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes not inconsistent with obligations under the Credit Agreement. We may obtain up to   $20,000,000   in the form of standby letters of credit and up to   $25,000,000   in the form of swing line loans. The Line of Credit matures on August 25, 2019, and may be extended for   one     12  -month period during the term of the Credit Agreement subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee.  
  The maximum principal amount of the Credit Agreement may be increased by up to   $100,000,000  , for a total principal amount of   $200,000,000  , subject to: (i) the terms of the Credit Agreement; and (ii) at least five business days  prior written notice to Bank of America.

Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%  , (3) the one-month Eurodollar Rate plus   1.00%  , and (4)   0.00%  , plus (ii) a margin ranging from   0.55%   to   1.05%   based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Accrued interest on the Line of Credit is payable monthly. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.  
  We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders  commitments under the Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to   0.20%   if the average daily used amount is greater than   50.0%   of the commitments and   0.25%   if the average daily used amount is less than or equal to   50.0%   of the commitments, which fee shall be measured and payable on a quarterly basis.  
  The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities and transactions of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of debt by our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also imposes certain financial covenants based on the following criteria, which are specifically defined in the Credit Agreement: (a) Consolidated Leverage Ratio; (b) Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio; (c) Consolidated Tangible Net Worth; (d) Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio; (e) Unencumbered Indebtedness Yield; (f) Consolidated Unencumbered Leverage Ratio; (g) Consolidated Unencumbered Interest Coverage Ratio; (h) Secured Recourse Indebtedness; and (i) Consolidated Unsecured Indebtedness.  
  The Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America has the right to terminate its obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the funding of future loans, and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and interest thereon. Additionally, in connection with the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a Pledge Agreement on August 25, 2016, pursuant to which we pledged the capital stock of our subsidiaries which own the real property to be included in the Unencumbered Property Pool, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement. The pledged collateral will be released upon achieving a consolidated total asset value of at least   $750,000,000  .

Environmental Matters  
  We follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.  
  Other 
  Our other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business, which include calls/puts to sell/acquire properties. In our view, these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  10. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned greater than a   99.99%   and a   99.00%   general partnership interest, respectively, in our operating partnership, and our advisor owned less than a   0.01%   and a   1.00%   limited partnership interest, respectively, in our operating partnership. The noncontrolling interest of our advisor in our operating partnership, which has redemption features outside of our control, is accounted for as a redeemable noncontrolling interest and is presented outside of permanent equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.   See Note 11, Equity     Noncontrolling Interest of Limited Partner in Operating Partnership, for a further discussion. In addition,   see Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Liquidity Stage   Subordinated Participation Interest   Subordinated Distribution Upon Listing, and   Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Subordinated Distribution Upon Termination, for a further discussion of the redemption features of the limited partnership units. 
  We record the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interest at the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest s share of net income or loss and distributions; or (ii) the redemption value. The changes in the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interest consisted of the following for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

11. Equity    
  Preferred Stock 
  Our charter authorizes us to issue   200,000,000   shares of our preferred stock, par value   $0.01   per share. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. 
  Common Stock 
  Our charter authorizes us to issue   1,000,000,000   shares of our common stock, par value   $0.01   per share. We commenced our public offering of shares of our common stock on February 16, 2016, and as of such date we were offering to the public up to   $3,150,000,000   of shares of our Class T common stock, consisting of up to   $3,000,000,000   of shares of our Class T common stock for   $10.00   per share in our primary offering and up to   $150,000,000   of shares of our Class T common stock for   $9.50   per share pursuant to the DRIP. Effective June 17, 2016, we reallocated certain of the unsold shares of our Class T common stock being offered, such that we are currently offering up to approximately   $2,800,000,000   in shares of Class T common stock at a price of   $10.00   per share and   $200,000,000   in shares of Class I common stock at a price of   $9.30   per share in our primary offering, and up to   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP at a purchase price of   $9.50   per share. Subsequent to the reallocation, of the   1,000,000,000   shares of common stock authorized,   900,000,000   shares are classified as Class T common stock and   100,000,000   shares are classified as Class I common stock. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the primary offering and the DRIP, and among classes of stock.

Each share of our common stock, regardless of class, will be entitled to one vote per share on matters presented to the common stockholders for approval; provided, however, that stockholders of one share class shall have exclusive voting rights on any amendment to our charter that would alter only the contract rights of that share class, and no stockholders of another share class shall be entitled to vote thereon. 
  On February 6, 2015, our advisor acquired   22,222   shares of our Class T common stock for total cash consideration of   $200,000   and was admitted as our initial stockholder. We used the proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class T common stock to our advisor to make an initial capital contribution to our operating partnership. We effected a reverse stock split as of July 23, 2015, whereby every 2.50 shares of our Class T common stock issued and outstanding were combined into one share of our Class T common stock, resulting in our advisor owning   8,889   shares of our Class T common stock following the reverse stock split. On October 22, 2015, we effected a stock split, whereby every share of our Class T common stock issued and outstanding was split into   2.343749   shares of our Class T common stock, resulting in our advisor owning   20,833   shares of our Class T common stock. 
  On April 13, 2016, we granted an aggregate of   15,000   shares of our restricted common stock to our independent directors. Through   September 30, 2016  , we had issued   5,374,861   aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock in connection with the primary portion of our offering and   23,379   shares of our Class T and Class I common stock pursuant to the DRIP. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   5,434,073   and   20,833   shares of our Class T and Class I common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a receivable of   $926,000   for offering proceeds, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, from our transfer agent, which was received in October 2016. 
  Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  We have registered and reserved   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock for sale pursuant to the DRIP in our offering. The DRIP allows stockholders to purchase additional Class T shares and Class I shares of our common stock through the reinvestment of distributions during our offering at an offering price equal to   95.0%   of the primary offering price for Class T shares, or   $9.50   assuming a   $10.00   per share primary offering price for Class T shares. Pursuant to the DRIP, distributions with respect to Class T shares are reinvested in Class T shares and distributions with respect to Class I shares are reinvested in Class I shares.  
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $203,000   and   $222,000   in distributions, respectively, were reinvested and   21,376   and   23,379   shares of our common stock, respectively, were issued pursuant to the DRIP. No reinvestment of distributions were made for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a total of   $222,000   and   $0   in distributions, respectively, were reinvested and   23,379   and   0   shares of our common stock, respectively, were issued pursuant to the DRIP. 
  Share Repurchase Plan 
  In February 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase plan. The share repurchase plan allows for repurchases of shares of our common stock by us when certain criteria are met. Share repurchases will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Subject to the availability of the funds for share repurchases, we will limit the number of shares of our common stock repurchased during any calendar year to   5.0%   of the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year; provided, however, that shares subject to a repurchase requested upon the death of a stockholder will not be subject to this cap. Funds for the repurchase of shares of our common stock will come exclusively from the cumulative proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP. 
  All repurchases will be subject to a   one  -year holding period, except for repurchases made in connection with a stockholder s death or  qualifying disability,  as defined in our share repurchase plan. Further, all share repurchases will be repurchased following a   one  -year holding period at a price between   92.5%   and   100%   of each stockholder s repurchase amount depending on the period of time their shares have been held. At any time while we are engaged in an offering of shares of our common stock, the repurchase amount for shares repurchased under our share repurchase plan will always be equal to or lower than the applicable per share offering price. However, if shares of our common stock are repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, the repurchase price will be no less than   100%   of the price paid to acquire the shares of our common stock from us. Furthermore, our share repurchase plan provides that if there are insufficient funds to honor all repurchase requests, pending requests will be honored among all requests for repurchase in any given repurchase period, as follows: first, pro rata as to repurchases sought upon a stockholder s death; next, pro rata as to repurchases sought by

stockholders with a qualifying disability; and, finally, pro rata as to other repurchase requests. No share repurchases were requested or made for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  2015 Incentive Plan and Independent Directors Compensation Plan 
  In February 2016, we adopted our incentive plan, pursuant to which our board of directors or a committee of our independent directors may make grants of options, restricted shares of common stock, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights or other awards to our independent directors, employees and consultants. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to our incentive plan is   4,000,000   shares. 
  Upon the election of our   three   independent directors to our board of directors on February 12, 2016, or the service inception date, the independent directors each became entitled to   5,000   shares of our restricted Class T common stock, as defined in our incentive plan, upon the initial release from escrow of the minimum offering. Having raised the minimum offering and upon the initial release from escrow, on April 13, 2016, or the grant date, we granted   5,000   shares of our restricted Class T common stock, as defined in our incentive plan, to each of our   three   independent directors in connection with their initial election to our board of directors, of which   20.0%   immediately vested on the grant date and   20.0%   will vest on each of the first   four   anniversaries of the grant date. Shares of our restricted common stock may not be sold, transferred, exchanged, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered. Such restrictions expire upon vesting. Shares of our restricted common stock will have full voting rights and rights to distributions. 
  From the service inception date to the grant date, we recognized compensation expense related to the shares of our restricted Class T common stock based on the reporting date fair value, which was estimated at   $10.00   per share, the price paid to acquire one share of Class T common stock in our offering. After the grant date, compensation cost related to the shares of our restricted common stock is measured based on the grant date fair value. Stock compensation expense is recognized from the service inception date to the vesting date for each vesting tranche (i.e., on a tranche-by-tranche basis) using the accelerated attribution method. 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized compensation expense of   $14,000   and   $66,000  , respectively, which is included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. We did not incur compensation expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not assume any forfeitures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $84,000   and   $0  , respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested shares of our restricted common stock. This expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of   2.03   years. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted average grant date fair value of the nonvested shares of our restricted common stock was   $120,000   and   $0  , respectively. A summary of the status of the nonvested shares of our restricted common stock as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the changes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is presented below:

Offering Costs  
  Selling Commissions 
  Generally, we pay our dealer manager selling commissions of up to   3.0%   of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class T shares of our common stock pursuant to the primary offering. No selling commissions are payable on Class I shares or shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP. Our dealer manager may re-allow all or a portion of these fees to participating broker-dealers. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $1,012,000   and   $1,392,000  , respectively, in selling commissions to our dealer manager, which are charged to stockholders  equity as such amounts were paid to our dealer manager from the gross proceeds of our offering. Our dealer manager did not receive any selling commissions for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  .  
  Dealer Manager Fee 
  Generally, our dealer manager receives a dealer manager fee of up to   3.0%   of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the primary offering, of which   1.0%   of the gross offering proceeds is funded by us. No dealer manager fee is payable on shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP. Our dealer manager may re-allow all or a portion of these fees to participating broker-dealers. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $370,000   and   $521,000  , respectively, in dealer manager fees to our dealer manager, which are charged to stockholders  equity as such amounts were paid to our dealer manager or its affiliates from the gross proceeds of our offering. Our dealer manager did not receive any dealer manager fees for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  .   See Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Offering Stage   Dealer Manager Fee, for a further discussion of the dealer manager fee funded by our advisor. 
  Stockholder Servicing Fee 
  We pay our dealer manager a stockholder servicing fee with respect to our Class T shares sold as additional compensation to the dealer manager and participating broker-dealers. No stockholder servicing fee shall be paid with respect to Class I shares or shares sold pursuant to the DRIP. The stockholder servicing fee accrues daily equal to 1/365th of   1.0%   of the purchase price per share of our Class T shares sold and is paid quarterly. We will cease paying the stockholder servicing fee with respect to our Class T shares sold in our offering upon the occurrence of certain defined events. Our dealer manager may re-allow to participating broker-dealers all or a portion of the stockholder servicing fee for services that such participating broker-dealers perform in connection with the shares of our Class T common stock. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $1,349,000   and   $1,856,000  , respectively, to our dealer manager in connection with the stockholder servicing fee. As of   September 30, 2016  , we accrued   $1,847,000   in connection with the stockholder servicing fee payable, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities with a corresponding offset to stockholders  equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Noncontrolling Interest of Limited Partner in Operating Partnership 
  On February 6, 2015, our advisor made an initial capital contribution of   $2,000   to our operating partnership in exchange for   222   Class T partnership units. Following our reverse stock split and the corresponding conversion of the partnership units of our operating partnership, our advisor owned   89   Class T partnership units effective as of July 23, 2015. On October 22, 2015, we effected a stock split, which increased the number of Class T partnership units outstanding to   208  . Upon the effectiveness of the Advisory Agreement on February 16, 2016, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor became our advisor. As our advisor, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor is entitled to redemption rights of its limited partnership units. Therefore, as of February 16, 2016, such limited partnership units no longer meet the criteria for classification within the equity section of our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and as such, were reclassified outside of permanent equity, as a mezzanine item, in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.   See Note 10, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest  , for a further discussion.

We entered into the Advisory Agreement, which entitles our advisor and its affiliates to specified compensation for certain services, as well as reimbursement of certain expenses. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $2,331,000   and   $5,500,000  , respectively, in fees and expenses to our affiliates as detailed below. We did not incur fees and expenses to our affiliates for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  Offering Stage 
  Dealer Manager Fee 
  Generally, our dealer manager receives a dealer manager fee of up to   3.0%   of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the primary offering, of which   2.0%   of the gross offering proceeds is funded by our advisor. No dealer manager fee is payable on shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP. Our advisor intends to recoup the portion of the dealer manager fee it funds through the receipt of the Contingent Advisor Payment from us, as described below, through the payment of acquisition fees. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $741,000   and   $1,043,000  , respectively, payable to our advisor as part of the Contingent Advisor Payment in connection with the dealer manager fee that our advisor had incurred. We did not incur any dealer manager fees to our advisor for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our advisor had   no  t incurred any dealer manager fees as we commenced our offering in February 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we accrued   $1,043,000   as part of the Contingent Advisor Payment related to the dealer manager fee that our advisor had incurred, which is included in accounts payable due to affiliates with a corresponding offset to stockholders  equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not paid any amounts to our advisor in connection with the Contingent Advisor Payment.   See Note 11, Equity     Offering Costs   Dealer Manager Fee, for a further discussion of the dealer manager fee funded by us. 
  Other Organizational and Offering Expenses  
  Our other organizational and offering expenses in connection with our offering (other than selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the stockholder servicing fee) are funded by our advisor. Our advisor intends to recoup such expenses it funds through the receipt of the Contingent Advisor Payment from us, as described below, through the payment of acquisition fees. We anticipate that our other organizational and offering expenses will not exceed   1.0%   of the gross offering proceeds for shares of our common stock sold pursuant to our primary offering. No other organizational and offering expenses will be paid with respect to shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $344,000   and   $2,759,000  , respectively, payable to our advisor as part of the Contingent Advisor Payment in connection with the other organizational and offering expenses that our advisor had incurred. We did not incur any other organizational and offering expenses to our advisor or its affiliates for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our advisor has incurred other organizational and offering expenses of approximately   $1,606,000   on our behalf, which expenses were not recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets because such costs did not become our liability until we reached the minimum offering on April 12, 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2,759,000   as part of the Contingent Advisor Payment related to the other organizational and offering expenses that our advisor had incurred, which is included in accounts payable due to affiliates with a corresponding offset to stockholders  equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not paid any amounts to our advisor in connection with the Contingent Advisor Payment. 
  Acquisition and Development Stage    
  Acquisition Fee    
  We pay our advisor an acquisition fee of up to   4.50%   of the contract purchase price, including any contingent or earn-out payments that may be paid, of each property we acquire or, with respect to any real estate-related investment we originate or acquire, up to   4.25%   of the origination or acquisition price, including any contingent or earn-out payments that may be paid. The   4.50%   or   4.25%   acquisition fees consist of a   2.25%   or   2.00%   base acquisition fee, or the base acquisition fee, for real estate and real estate-related acquisitions, respectively, and an additional   2.25%   contingent advisor payment, or the Contingent Advisor Payment. The Contingent Advisor Payment allows our advisor to recoup the portion of the dealer manager fee and

other organizational and offering expenses funded by our advisor. Therefore, the amount of the Contingent Advisor Payment paid upon the closing of an acquisition shall not exceed the then outstanding amounts paid by our advisor for dealer manager fees and other organizational and offering expenses at the time of such closing. For these purposes, the amounts paid by our advisor and considered as  outstanding  will be reduced by the amount of the Contingent Advisor Payment previously paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial   $7,500,000   of amounts paid by our advisor to fund the dealer manager fee and other organizational and offering expenses, or the Contingent Advisor Payment Holdback, shall be retained by us until the later of the termination of our last public offering or the third anniversary of the commencement date of our initial public offering, at which time such amount shall be paid to our advisor or its affiliates. In connection with any subsequent public offering of shares of our common stock, the Contingent Advisor Payment Holdback may increase, based upon the maximum offering amount in such subsequent public offering and the amount sold in prior offerings. Our advisor or its affiliates will be entitled to receive these acquisition fees for properties and real estate-related investments acquired with funds raised in our offering, including acquisitions completed after the termination of the Advisory Agreement (including imputed leverage of   50.0%   on funds raised in our offering), or funded with net proceeds from the sale of a property or real estate-related investment, subject to certain conditions. Our advisor may waive or defer all or a portion of the acquisition fee at any time and from time to time, in our advisor s sole discretion.  
  The base acquisition fee in connection with the acquisition of properties is expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC Topic 805 and included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The base acquisition fee in connection with the acquisition of real estate-related investments is capitalized as part of the associated investment in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid base acquisition fees of   $1,220,000   and   $1,343,000  , respectively, to our advisor. We did not pay any base acquisition fees to our advisor for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . The Contingent Advisor Payment is used to decrease the liability we incur to our advisor in connection with the dealer manager fee and other organizational and offering expenses. For a further discussion of amounts paid in connection with the Contingent Advisor Payment, see Dealer Manager Fee and Other Organizational and Offering Expenses, above. In addition,   see Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net  , for a further discussion. 
  Development Fee    
  In the event our advisor or its affiliates provide development-related services, we pay our advisor or its affiliates a development fee in an amount that is usual and customary for comparable services rendered for similar projects in the geographic market where the services are provided; however, we will not pay a development fee to our advisor or its affiliates if our advisor or its affiliates elect to receive an acquisition fee based on the cost of such development.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any development fees to our advisor or its affiliates. 
  Reimbursement of Acquisition Expenses    
  We reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for acquisition expenses related to selecting, evaluating and acquiring assets, which will be reimbursed regardless of whether an asset is acquired. The reimbursement of acquisition expenses, acquisition fees and real estate commissions paid to unaffiliated parties will not exceed, in the aggregate,   6.0%   of the contract purchase price of the property or real estate-related investment or total development costs, unless fees in excess of such limits are approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction.  
  Reimbursements of acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC Topic 805 and included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Reimbursements of acquisition expenses in connection with the acquisition of real estate-related investments are capitalized as part of the associated investment in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any acquisition expenses to our advisor or its affiliates.

Operational Stage    
  Asset Management Fee    
  We pay our advisor or its affiliates a monthly fee for services rendered in connection with the management of our assets equal to one-twelfth of   0.80%   of average invested assets. For such purposes, average invested assets means the average of the aggregate book value of our assets invested in real estate properties and real estate-related investments, before deducting depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves, computed by taking the average of such values at the end of each month during the period of calculation. 
  Asset management fees are included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. We did not incur any asset management fees for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a result of our advisor waiving   $29,000   and   $31,000  , respectively, in asset management fees. Our advisor agreed to waive certain asset management fees that may otherwise be due to our advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement until such time as the amount of such waived asset management fees is equal to the amount of distributions payable to our stockholders for the period beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on the date of the acquisition of our first property or real estate-related investment, as such terms are defined in the Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, pursuant to such waiver, the asset management fees of   $31,000   that would have been incurred through September 2016 were waived by our advisor and we anticipate an additional   $49,000   in asset management fees will be waived in subsequent months. Our advisor will not receive any additional securities, shares of our stock, or any other form of consideration or any repayment as a result of the waiver of such asset management fees. We did not incur any asset management fees to our advisor or its affiliates for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . 
  Property Management Fee    
  Our advisor or its affiliates may provide property management services with respect to our properties or may sub-contract these duties to any third party and provide oversight of such third-party property manager. We pay our advisor or its affiliates a monthly management fee equal to a percentage of the gross monthly cash receipts of such property as follows: (i) a   1.0%   property management oversight fee for any stand-alone, single-tenant, net leased property, except for such properties operated utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a  RIDEA  structure (the provisions of the Code authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008), for which we pay a property management oversight fee of   1.5%   of the gross monthly cash receipts with respect to such property; (ii) a   1.5%   property management oversight fee for any property that is not a stand-alone, single-tenant, net leased property and for which our advisor or its affiliates provide oversight of a third party that performs the duties of a property manager with respect to such property; or (iii) a fair and reasonable property management fee that is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, that is not less favorable to us than terms available from unaffiliated third parties for any property that is not a stand-alone, single-tenant, net leased property and for which our advisor or its affiliates directly serve as the property manager without sub-contracting such duties to a third party. 
  Property management fees are included in rental expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred property management fees of   $5,000   to our advisor or its affiliates. We did not incur any property management fees to our advisor or its affiliates for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  Lease Fees 
  We may pay our advisor or its affiliates a separate fee for any leasing activities in an amount not to exceed the fee customarily charged in arm s-length transactions by others rendering similar services in the same geographic area for similar properties as determined by a survey of brokers and agents in such area. Such fee is generally expected to range from   3.0%   to   6.0%   of the gross revenues generated during the initial term of the lease.  
  Lease fees are capitalized as lease commissions and are included in other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any lease fees to our advisor or its affiliates.

Construction Management Fee 
  In the event that our advisor or its affiliates assist with planning and coordinating the construction of any capital or tenant improvements, we pay our advisor or its affiliates a construction management fee of up to   5.0%   of the cost of such improvements. Construction management fees are capitalized as part of the associated asset and included in real estate investments, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets or are expensed and included in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, as applicable. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any construction management fees to our advisor or its affiliates.  
  Operating Expenses    
  We reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for operating expenses incurred in rendering services to us, subject to certain limitations. However, we cannot reimburse our advisor or its affiliates at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses that, in the   four   consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of: (i)   2.0%   of our average invested assets, as defined in the Advisory Agreement; or (ii)   25.0%   of our net income, as defined in the Advisory Agreement, unless our independent directors determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and nonrecurring factors which they deem sufficient.  
  For the 12 months ended   September 30, 2016  , our operating expenses exceeded this limitation by   $498,000  . Our operating expenses as a percentage of average invested assets and as a percentage of net income were   7.9%   and   (24.1)%  , respectively, for the 12 months ended   September 30, 2016  . We raised the minimum offering and had funds held in escrow released to us to commence real estate operations in April 2016. We purchased our first property in June 2016. At this early stage of our operations, our general and administrative expenses are relatively high compared with our net income and our average invested assets. Our board of directors determined that the relationship of our general and administrative expenses to our funds from operations and our average invested assets was justified for the 12 months ended   September 30, 2016   given the costs of operating a public company and the early stage of our operations.  
   For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our advisor incurred operating expenses on our behalf of   $21,000   and   $350,000  , respectively. Our advisor or its affiliates did not incur any operating expenses on our behalf for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . Operating expenses are generally included in general and administrative in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Compensation for Additional Services 
  We pay our advisor and its affiliates for services performed for us other than those required to be rendered by our advisor or its affiliates under the Advisory Agreement. The rate of compensation for these services has to be approved by a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, and cannot exceed an amount that would be paid to unaffiliated parties for similar services. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , our advisor and its affiliates were not compensated for any additional services.  
  Liquidity Stage    
  Disposition Fees    
  For services relating to the sale of one or more properties, we pay our advisor or its affiliates a disposition fee up to the lesser of   2.0%   of the contract sales price or   50.0%   of a customary competitive real estate commission given the circumstances surrounding the sale, in each case as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, upon the provision of a substantial amount of the services in the sales effort. The amount of disposition fees paid, when added to the real estate commissions paid to unaffiliated parties, will not exceed the lesser of the customary competitive real estate commission or an amount equal to   6.0%   of the contract sales price. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not incur any disposition fees to our advisor or its affiliates.

Subordinated Participation Interest 
  Subordinated Distribution of Net Sales Proceeds    
  In the event of liquidation, we will pay our advisor a subordinated distribution of net sales proceeds. The distribution will be equal to   15.0%   of the remaining net proceeds from the sales of properties, after distributions to our stockholders, in the aggregate, of: (i) a full return of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan); plus (ii) an annual   6.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock, as adjusted for distributions of net sales proceeds. Actual amounts to be received depend on the sale prices of properties upon liquidation. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not pay any such distributions to our advisor. 
  Subordinated Distribution Upon Listing    
  Upon the listing of shares of our common stock on a national securities exchange, in redemption of our advisor s limited partnership units, we will pay our advisor a distribution equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which: (i) the market value of our outstanding common stock at listing plus distributions paid prior to listing exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan) and the amount of cash that, if distributed to stockholders as of the date of listing, would have provided them an annual   6.0%   cumulative, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the date of listing. Actual amounts to be received depend upon the market value of our outstanding stock at the time of listing, among other factors. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not pay any such distributions to our advisor. 
  Subordinated Distribution Upon Termination 
  Pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended, of our operating partnership upon termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement, our advisor will also be entitled to a subordinated distribution in redemption of its limited partnership units from our operating partnership equal to     15.0%     of the amount, if any, by which: (i) the appraised value of our assets on the termination date, less any indebtedness secured by such assets, plus total distributions paid through the termination date, exceeds (ii) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders (less amounts paid to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan) an  d the total amount of cash equal to an annual   6.0%   cumula  tive, non-compounded return on the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through the termination date. In addition, our advisor may elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either a listing or other liquidity event, including a liquidation, sale of substantially all of our assets or merger in which our stockholders receive in exchange for their shares of our common stock, shares of a company that are traded on a national securities exchange.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had not recorded any charges to earnings related to the subordinated distribution upon termination.  
  Stock Purchase Plans    
  On February 29, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Jeffrey T. Hanson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Danny Prosky, and our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Mathieu B. Streiff, each executed stock purchase plans, or the stock purchase plans, whereby they each irrevocably agreed to invest   100%   of their net after-tax base salary and cash bonus compensation earned as employees of American Healthcare Investors directly into our company by purchasing shares of our common stock. In addition, on February 29, 2016, three Executive Vice Presidents of American Healthcare Investors, including our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions, Stefan K.L. Oh, executed similar stock purchase plans, whereby each individual irrevocably agreed to invest a portion of their net after-tax base salary or a portion of their net after-tax base salary and cash bonus compensation, ranging from   10.0%   to   15.0%  , earned as employees of American Healthcare Investors directly into our company by purchasing shares of our common stock.  
  Purchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock purchase plans commenced beginning with the officers  regularly scheduled payroll payment after the initial release from escrow of the minimum offering amount, on April 13, 2016. The stock purchase plans terminate on December 31, 2016 or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, unless otherwise renewed or extended. The shares of common stock were purchased at a price of   $9.60   per share, reflecting the purchase price of the Class T shares in our offering, exclusive of selling commissions and the portion of the dealer manager fee funded by us.

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our officers invested the following amounts and we issued the following shares of our Class T common stock pursuant to the applicable stock purchase plan: 

Accounts Payable Due to Affiliates 
  The following amounts were outstanding to our affiliates as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

13. Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair Value  
  ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments,   requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet. Fair value is defined under ASC Topic 820. 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: cash, accounts and other receivables, real estate deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accounts payable due to affiliates, mortgage loan payable and borrowings under the Line of Credit.   
  We consider the carrying values of cash, accounts and other receivables, real estate deposits and accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments based upon an evaluation of the underlying characteristics, market data and because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of cash is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of accounts payable due to affiliates is not determinable due to the related party nature of the accounts payable. The fair value of the other financial instruments is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The fair value of the mortgage loan payable and the Line of Credit is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using borrowing rates available to us for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the mortgage loan payable was   $4,102,000  , compared to the carrying value of   $3,847,000  . As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the Line of Credit was   $12,007,000  , compared to the carrying value of   $11,030,000  . We did not have any mortgage loan payable nor line of credit as of December 31, 2015. We have determined that the mortgage loan payable and the Line of Credit are classified in Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  14. Business Combinations    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , using net proceeds from our offering and debt financing, we completed   five   property acquisitions comprising   five   buildings, which have been accounted for as business combinations. The aggregate contract purchase price for these property acquisitions was   $59,670,000  , plus closing costs and base acquisition fees of   $1,980,000  , which are included in acquisition related expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. See   Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net  , for a listing of the properties acquired, acquisition dates and the amount of financing initially incurred in connection with such acquisitions. In addition, we incurred Contingent Advisor Payments of   $1,342,000   to our advisor for these property acquisitions. See   Note 12, Related Party Transactions  , for a further discussion of

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   (Continued) 

the Contingent Advisor Payment. We did not complete any property acquisitions for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Results of operations for these property acquisitions during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the period from the date of acquisition of each property through   September 30, 2016  . For the period from the acquisition date through   September 30, 2016  , we recognized the following amounts of revenue and net income for the property acquisitions:   

  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during 2016 were preliminary estimates determined using the income, cost and market approaches. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one year from the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of our   five   property acquisitions in 2016:   

  Assuming the property acquisitions in 2016 discussed above had occurred on January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception), for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , unaudited pro forma revenue, net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest and net income (loss) per Class T and Class I common share attributable to controlling interest   basic and diluted would have been as follows:   

  The unaudited pro forma adjustments assume that the offering proceeds, at a price of   $10.00   per share, net of offering costs, were raised as of January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception). In addition, acquisition related expenses associated with the acquisitions have been excluded from the pro forma results in 2016 and added to the 2015 pro forma results. The pro forma

results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been obtained had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
   
  15. Concentration of Credit Risk    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily cash, accounts and other receivables and real estate deposits. Cash is generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants is limited. In general, we perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution. 
  Based on leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016  ,   four   states in the United States accounted for   10.0%   or more of our annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Our properties located in Virginia, Alabama, Pennsylvania and Michigan accounted for approximately   35.0%  ,   28.7%  ,   14.7%   and   13.0%  , respectively, of the annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state s economy. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two   tenants that accounted for   10.0%   or more of our annualized base rent, as follows: 
   
 ___________ 
           (1) 
    Annualized base rent is based on contractual base rent from the leases in effect as of   September 30, 2016  . The loss of any of these tenants or their inability to pay rent could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
     For the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not own any properties. 
   
  16. Per Share Data    
  We report earnings (loss) per share pursuant to ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share  . Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of   $2,000   and   $3,000  , respectively, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , we did not allocate any distributions to participating securities. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   12,000   and   0   nonvested shares, respectively, of our restricted common stock outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   208   units of redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. 
   
  17. Subsequent Events 
  Status of Our Offering  
  As of November 4, 2016, we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for   7,689,964   aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or   $76,512,000  , excluding subscriptions from residents of Pennsylvania (who will not be admitted as stockholders until we have received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least   $150,000,000  ) and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP.

Property Acquisition 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we completed   one   property acquisition comprising   three   buildings from unaffiliated parties. The contract purchase price of this property was   $31,000,000  , plus closing costs, and we incurred   $1,395,000   in total acquisition fees to our advisor in connection with this property acquisition. We have not yet measured and determined the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities nor the proforma results of the acquisition. The following is a summary of our property acquisition subsequent to   September 30, 2016  :

    Our advisor was paid, as compensation for services rendered in connection with the investigation, selection and acquisition of our property, a base acquisition fee of   2.25%   of the contract purchase price upon the closing of the acquisition. In addition, the total acquisition fee includes a Contingent Advisor Payment in the amount of   2.25%   of the contract purchase price of the property acquired, which shall be paid by us to our advisor, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.   See Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Acquisition and Development Stage   Acquisition Fee, for a further discussion.

  The use of the words  we,   us  or  our  refers to Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, except where the context otherwise requires. 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 7, 2016. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and information have been prepared to reflect our financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , together with our results of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015   and cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . 
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Historical results and trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Our statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements.

Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future investments on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically; legislative and regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing the taxation of real estate investment trusts, or REITs; the availability of capital; changes in interest rates; competition in the real estate industry; the supply and demand for operating properties in our proposed market areas; changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, policies and guidelines applicable to REITs; the success of our best efforts initial public offering; the availability of properties to acquire; the availability of financing; and our ongoing relationship with American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or American Healthcare Investors, and Griffin Capital Corporation, or Griffin Capital, and their affiliates. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional information concerning us and our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the SEC. 
  Overview and Background 
  Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated on   January 23, 2015   and therefore we consider that our date of inception. We were initially capitalized on   February 6, 2015  . We invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We may also originate and acquire secured loans and real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income. We intend to elect to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. 
  On February 16, 2016, we commenced our initial public offering, or our offering, in which we were offering to the public a minimum of   $2,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock, or the minimum offering, and a maximum of   $3,000,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock in our primary offering at a purchase price of   $10.00   per share. Effective June 17, 2016, we reallocated certain of the unsold shares being offered, such that we are currently offering up to approximately   $2,800,000,000   in shares of Class T common stock at a price of   $10.00   per share and   $200,000,000   in shares of Class I common stock at a price of   $9.30   per share in our primary offering, and up to   $150,000,000   in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, at a purchase price of   $9.50   per share, aggregating up to   $3,150,000,000  , or the maximum offering. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the primary offering and the DRIP, and among classes of stock. 
  The conditions of our minimum offering were satisfied on April 12, 2016, and we admitted our initial public subscribers as stockholders, excluding shares purchased by residents of Ohio, Washington and Pennsylvania (who were subject to higher minimum offering amounts). Having raised the minimum offering, the offering proceeds were released by the escrow agent to us on April 13, 2016 and were made available for the acquisition of properties and other purposes as disclosed in our prospectus dated February 16, 2016, or our prospectus, as filed with the SEC (provided that subscriptions from residents of Ohio, Washington and Pennsylvania were to continue to be held in escrow until we had received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least   $10,000,000  ,   $20,000,000   and   $150,000,000  , respectively). The conditions of our minimum offering in

     Table of Contents  

Ohio and Washington were satisfied on June 14, 2016 and July 8, 2016, respectively, and as of such dates we were able to admit Ohio and Washington subscribers as stockholders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for   5,374,861   aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or approximately   $53,443,000  , excluding subscriptions from residents in Pennsylvania (who will not be admitted as stockholders until we have received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least $150,000,000) and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP.  
  We conduct substantially all of our operations through Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership. We are externally advised by Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, LLC, or Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, or our advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement, or the Advisory Agreement, between us and our advisor that has a   one  -year term that expires on February 16, 2017 and is subject to successive   one  -year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties. Our advisor uses its best efforts, subject to the oversight and review of our board of directors, to, among other things, research, identify, review and make investments in and dispositions of properties and securities on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Our advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as our fiduciary.   Our a  dvisor is   75.0%   owned and managed by American Healthcare Investors and   25.0%   owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Corporation, or collectively, our co-sponsors. Effective March 1, 2015, American Healthcare Investors is   47.1%   owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC, or AHI Group Holdings,   45.1%   indirectly owned by NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), or NSAM, and   7.8%   owned by James F. Flaherty III, one of NSAM s partners. NSAM has announced its intention to merge with Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE:CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) to form a new combined company, Colony NorthStar, Inc. The proposed merger is subject to substantial closing conditions, including the required approval from each respective company s stockholders, governmental and regulatory agencies and third parties. We are not affiliated with Griffin Capital, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, or Griffin Capital Securities, or our dealer manager, NSAM, Mr. Flaherty, Colony Capital, Inc. or NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.; however, we are affiliated with Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, American Healthcare Investors and AHI Group Holdings. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had completed   five   property acquisitions comprising   five   buildings, or approximately   211,000   square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of   $59,670,000  .  
  Critical Accounting Policies

  Interim Unaudited Financial Data 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016.

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 
  We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, management and operation of properties other than those listed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those Risk Factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016. 
  Real Estate Revenue 
  The amount of revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of leased space and to lease available space and space available from lease terminations at the then existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in the future. 
  Offering Proceeds 
  If we fail to raise significant proceeds above our minimum offering, we will not have enough proceeds to invest in a diversified real estate portfolio. Our real estate portfolio would be concentrated in a small number of properties, resulting in increased exposure to local and regional economic downturns and the poor performance of one or more of our properties and, therefore, expose our stockholders to increased risk. In addition, many of our expenses are fixed regardless of the size of our real estate portfolio. Therefore, depending on the amount of proceeds we raise from our offering, we would expend a larger portion of our income on operating expenses. This would reduce our profitability and, in turn, the amount of net income available for distribution to our stockholders. 
  Scheduled Lease Expirations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our properties were 97.2% leased and during the remainder of 2016, none of the leased GLA is scheduled to expire. Our leasing strategy focuses on negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the next 12 months. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate renewals, we will try to identify new tenants or collaborate with existing tenants who are seeking additional space to occupy.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our remaining weighted average lease term was 6.7 years.  
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and disclosure requirements applicable to public companies have increased the costs of compliance with corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. These costs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could impact our ability to pay distributions at current rates to our stockholders. Furthermore, we expect that these costs will increase in the future due to our continuing implementation of compliance programs mandated by these requirements. Any increased costs may affect our ability to distribute funds to our stockholders. As part of our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be providing management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. 
  In addition, these laws, rules and regulations create new legal bases for potential administrative enforcement, civil and criminal proceedings against us in the event of non-compliance, thereby increasing the risks of liability and potential sanctions against us. We expect that our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations will continue to involve significant and potentially increasing costs, and that our failure to comply with these laws could result in fees, fines, penalties or administrative remedies against us. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  We had no results of operations   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  , and therefore our results of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  , are not comparable. In general, we expect all amounts to increase in the future based on a full year of operations as well as increased activity as we acquire additional real estate or real estate-related investments. Our results of operations are not indicative of those expected in future periods.  
  Except where otherwise noted, our results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are primarily comprised of income derived from our five medical office buildings acquired as of   September 30, 2016   and acquisition related expenses related to such properties, as well as general and administrative expenses.

Real Estate Revenue 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , real estate revenue was   $312,000   and   $338,000  , respectively, and primarily comprised base rent of $191,000 and $194,000, respectively, and expense recoveries of $88,000 and $111,000, respectively.  
  Rental Expenses 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , rental expenses were   $98,000   and   $121,000  , respectively. Rental expenses consisted of the following for the periods then ended:    

  General and Administrative 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expenses were   $329,000   and  $725,000  , respectively. General and administrative consisted of the following for the periods then ended:    

  We did not incur any asset management fees for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as a result of our advisor waiving   $31,000   in asset management fees through September 2016.   See Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Operational Stage   Asset Management Fee, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for a further discussion of such waiver.  
  Acquisition Related Expenses 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , acquisition related expenses were   $1,857,000   and   $2,227,000  , respectively, and were related primarily to expenses associated with our four and five property acquisitions, respectively, including base acquisition fees of   $1,220,000   and   $1,343,000  , respectively, incurred to our advisor. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $64,000   and consisted primarily of depreciation on our operating properties of $40,000 and amortization on our identified intangible assets of $24,000. 
  Interest Expense 
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , interest expense was   $56,000   and related primarily to the unused fee of $26,000 and to amortization of deferred financing costs of $27,000 on our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, or the Line of Credit.   See Note 7, Line of Credit  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for a further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our sources of funds will primarily be the net proceeds of our offering, operating cash flows and borrowings. We believe that these resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other sources within the next 12 months.  
  We are dependent upon the net proceeds to be received from our offering to conduct our proposed activities. Our ability to raise funds through our offering is dependent on general economic conditions, general market conditions for REITs and our operating performance. We expect a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as net offering proceeds are expended in connection with the acquisition, management and operation of our investments in real estate and real estate-related investments. 
  Our principal demands for funds will be for acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments, payment of operating expenses and interest on our future indebtedness and payment of distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we require resources to make certain payments to our advisor and our dealer manager, which during our offering will include payments to our dealer manager and its affiliates for selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the stockholder servicing fee.   See Note 11, Equity     Offering Costs, and   Note 12, Related Party Transactions  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for a further discussion of our payments to our advisor and our dealer manager.  
  Generally, cash needs for items other than acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments will be met from operations, borrowings and the net proceeds of our offering, including the proceeds raised through the DRIP. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares of common stock and our investments in real estate and real estate-related investments, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investments. 
  Our advisor evaluates potential investments and engages in negotiations with real estate sellers, developers, brokers, investment managers, lenders and others on our behalf. Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract for a property is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence, which includes review of the title insurance commitment, market evaluation, review of leases, review of financing options and an environmental analysis. In some instances, the proposed acquisition will require the negotiation of final binding agreements, which may include financing documents. Until we invest the proceeds of our offering in real estate and real estate-related investments, we may invest in short-term, highly liquid or other authorized investments. Such short-term investments will not earn significant returns, and we cannot predict how long it will take to fully invest the proceeds in real estate and real estate related-investments. The number of properties we may acquire and other investments we will make will depend upon the number of shares of our common stock sold and the resulting amount of the net proceeds available for investment from our offering as well as our ability to arrange debt financing. 
  When we acquire a property, our advisor prepares a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan will also set forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include a line of credit or other loan established with respect to the investment, other borrowings, operating cash generated by the investment, additional equity investments from us or joint venture partners or, when necessary, capital reserves. Any capital reserve would be established from the net proceeds of our offering, proceeds from sales of other investments, operating cash generated by other investments or other cash on hand. In some cases, a lender may require us to establish capital reserves for a particular investment. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. 
  Based on the properties we own as of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that our expenditures for capital improvements will require up to $231,000 for the remaining three months of 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any restricted cash in reserve accounts for such capital expenditures. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not exceed these estimated expenditure and distribution levels or be able to obtain additional sources of financing on commercially favorable terms or at all.  
  Other Liquidity Needs  
  In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to various factors, including, without limitation, the timing of distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to pay distributions by means of secured or unsecured debt financing through one or more third parties, or our advisor or its affiliates. There are currently no limits or restrictions on the use of proceeds from our advisor or its affiliates which would prohibit us from making the proceeds available for distribution. We may also pay distributions from cash from capital transactions, including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties.

     Table of Contents  

If we experience lower occupancy levels, reduced rental rates, reduced revenues as a result of asset sales, or increased capital expenditures and leasing costs compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewed leases, the effect would be a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities. If such a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities is realized, we may have a cash flow deficit in subsequent periods. Our estimate of net cash available is based on various assumptions which are difficult to predict, including the levels of leasing activity and related leasing costs. Any changes in these assumptions could impact our financial results and our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth changes in cash flows:   

  The following summary discussion of our changes in our cash flows is based on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
  Operating Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows used in operating activities related primarily to the payment of acquisition related expenses and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to increase as we purchase additional real estate investments and have a full year of operations. 
  Investing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows used in investing activities related primarily to the acquisition of five medical office buildings in the amount of   $55,619,000   and the payment of   $1,000,000   for real estate deposits. Cash flows used in investing activities are heavily dependent upon the investment of our offering proceeds in real estate investments. We anticipate cash flows used in investing activities to increase as we acquire additional properties.  
  Financing Activities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows provided by financing activities related primarily to funds raised from investors in our offering in the amount of $  52,484,000   and borrowings on the Line of Credit of   $12,000,000  , partially offset by the payment of offering costs of $  1,889,000   in connection with our offering, the payment of deferred financing costs of   $1,027,000   in connection with the Line of Credit and mortgage loan payable and distributions to our common stockholders of $  148,000  . For the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  , cash flows provided by financing activities related to $200,000 received from our advisor for the purchase of 20,833 shares of our common stock and an initial capital contribution of $2,000 from our advisor into our operating partnership. We anticipate cash flows from financing activities to increase in the future as we raise additional funds from investors and incur debt to purchase properties.  
  Distributions 
  On April 13, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period from May 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. Our advisor agreed to waive certain asset management fees that may otherwise be due to our advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement until such time as the amount of such waived asset management fees is equal to the amount of distributions payable to our stockholders for the period beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on the date of the acquisition of our first property or real estate-related investment, as such terms are defined in the Advisory Agreement. Having raised the minimum offering in April 2016, the distributions declared for each record date in the May 2016 and June 2016 periods were paid in June 2016 and July 2016, respectively, from legally available funds. The daily distributions were calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and were equal to   $0.001643836   per share of our Class T common stock. These distributions were aggregated and paid in cash or shares of our  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

common stock pursuant to the DRIP monthly in arrears. We acquired our first property on June 28, 2016, and as such, our advisor waived asset management fees equal to the amount of distributions paid from May 1, 2016 through June 27, 2016.   See Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Operational Stage   Asset Management Fee, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of such waiver. Our advisor will not receive any additional securities, shares of our stock, or any other form of consideration or any repayment as a result of the waiver of such asset management fees. 
  On June 28, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending September 30, 2016 and to our Class I stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on the date that the first Class I share was sold and ending on September 30, 2016. On September 28, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T and Class I stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on October 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016. The daily distributions were or will be calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and are equal to $0.001643836 per share of our Class T and Class I common stock. These distributions were or will be aggregated and paid in cash or shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP monthly in arrears, only from legally available funds. 
  The amount of distributions paid to our stockholders is determined quarterly by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. We have not established any limit on the amount of offering proceeds that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences. 
  We did not pay any distributions   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the sources of distributions as compared to cash flows from operations were as follows:   

  Under GAAP, acquisition related expenses are expensed, and therefore, subtracted from cash flows from operations. However, these expenses may be paid from offering proceeds or debt. 
  Our distributions of amounts in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits have resulted in a return of capital to our stockholders, and all or any portion of a distribution to our stockholders may be paid from offering proceeds. The payment of distributions from our offering proceeds could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and negatively impact the amount of income available for future distributions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an amount payable of   $3,835,000   to our advisor or its affiliates primarily for the Contingent Advisor Payment and operating expenses, which will be paid from cash flows from operations in the future as it becomes due and payable by us in the ordinary course of business consistent with our past practice. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates had been deferred, waived or forgiven other than the   $31,000   in asset management fees waived by our advisor.   See Note 12, Related Party Transactions     Operational Stage   Asset Management Fee, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of such waiver. Other than the waiver of asset management fees by our advisor to provide us with additional funds to pay initial distributions to our stockholders through June 27, 2016, our advisor and its affiliates, including our co-sponsors, have no obligation to defer or forgive fees owed by us to our advisor or its affiliates or to advance any funds to us. In the future, if our advisor or its affiliates do not defer or continue to defer, waive or forgive amounts due to them, this would negatively affect our cash flows from operations, which could result in us paying distributions, or a portion thereof, using borrowed funds. As a  
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

result, the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
  We did not pay distributions   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the sources of our distributions as compared to funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or FFO, were as follows:   

  The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. For a further discussion of FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, including a reconciliation of our GAAP net loss to FFO, see Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations, below. 
  Financing 
  We intend to continue to finance a portion of the purchase price of our investments in real estate and real estate-related investments by borrowing funds. We anticipate that, after an initial phase of our operations (prior to the investment of all of the net proceeds of our offering) when we may employ greater amounts of leverage to enable us to purchase properties more quickly and therefore generate distributions for our stockholders sooner, our overall leverage will not exceed 50.0% of the combined market value of all of our properties and other real estate-related investments, as determined at the end of each calendar year beginning with our first full year of operations. For these purposes, the fair market value of each asset will be equal to the purchase price paid for the asset or, if the asset was appraised subsequent to the date of purchase, then the fair market value will be equal to the value reported in the most recent independent appraisal of the asset. Our policies do not limit the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual investment. As of   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate borrowings were 26.7% of the combined market value of all of our real estate investments. 
  Under our charter, we have a limitation on borrowing that precludes us from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets without the approval of a majority of our independent directors. Net assets for purposes of this calculation are defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. Generally, the preceding calculation is expected to approximate 75.0% of the aggregate cost of our real estate and real estate-related investments before depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves. In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge some or all of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real estate or for working capital. We may also borrow funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to ensure that we qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of   November 9, 2016   and   September 30, 2016  , our leverage did not exceed 300% of the value of our net assets.

  REIT Requirements 
  In order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to make

     Table of Contents  

distributions to our stockholders of at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to factors including, without limitation, the timing of such distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to pay distributions by means of secured debt financing through one or more unaffiliated parties. We may also pay distributions from cash from capital transactions including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties or from the proceeds of our offering. 
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  For a discussion of our commitments and contingencies,   see Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Debt Service Requirements 
  Our principal liquidity need is the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a $3,949,000 ($3,847,000, including deferred financing costs) fixed-rate mortgage loan payable outstanding secured by our Rochester MOB property. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $12,000,000 outstanding, and $88,000,000 remained available under the Line of Credit.   See Note 6, Mortgage Loan Payable, Net  , and   Note 7, Line of Credit  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet certain covenants, such as leverage ratios, net worth ratios, debt service coverage ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios and reporting requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our mortgage loan payable and the Line of Credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, was 4.00% per annum. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table provides information with respect to: (i) the maturity and scheduled principal repayment of our secured mortgage loan payable and the Line of Credit; (ii) interest payments on our mortgage loan payable and the Line of Credit; and (iii) ground and other lease obligations as of   September 30, 2016  :   

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements or obligations. 
  Inflation 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, inflation has not significantly affected our operations because of the moderate inflation rate; however, we expect to be exposed to inflation risk as income from future long-term leases will be the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that will protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions will include negotiated rental increases, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the anticipated leases, among other factors, the leases may not re-set frequently enough to cover inflation.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP. 
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above. 
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, which is the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. In addition, we believe it is appropriate to exclude impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over time. Testing for an impairment of an asset is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. If certain impairment indications exist in an asset, and if the asset s carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset, an impairment charge would be recognized. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property. 
  Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss). 
  However, FFO and modified funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 
  Changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed as operating expenses under GAAP. We believe these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered, non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. We will use the proceeds raised in our offering to acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a merger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or another similar transaction) within five years after the completion of our offering stage, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life. Due to  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs, and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities, as well as other non-operating items included in FFO, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering stage has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines modified funds from operations as funds from operations further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected to be received cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect modified funds from operations on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income (loss) in calculating cash flows from operations and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, and we do not rely on another party to manage such risk. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges will not be a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are based on market fluctuations and may not be directly related or attributable to our operations. 
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, change in deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to redeemable noncontrolling interest. The other adjustments included in the IPA s Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  . Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

expenses and other costs related to such property. In the future, we may pay acquisition fees or reimburse acquisition expenses due to our advisor and its affiliates, or a portion thereof, with net proceeds from borrowed funds, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from the proceeds of our offering. 
  Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income (loss) in determining cash flows from operations. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. 
  Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence, that the use of such measures may be useful to investors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information. 
  Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and modified funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in offerings such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no net asset value determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO. 
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

The following is a reconciliation of net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and for the period from   January 23, 2015   (Date of Inception) through   September 30, 2015  : 

___________ 
           (1) 
    In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered, non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. 
              (2) 
    Under GAAP, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease (including rent holidays). This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than the underlying contract terms. By adjusting for the change in deferred rent receivables, MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms, providing insight on the expected contractual cash flows of such lease terms, and aligns results with our analysis of operating performance. 
              (3) 
    Includes all adjustments to eliminate the redeemable noncontrolling interest s share of the adjustments described in Notes (1)   (2) to convert our FFO to MFFO.

Net Operating Income 
  Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, acquisition related expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses. The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders. However, we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties. Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties, and therefore, if there is no further cash on hand from the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses, such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment, operations and non-operating expenses would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. Nevertheless, our advisor or its affiliates will not accrue any claim on our assets if acquisition fees and expenses are not paid from the proceeds of our offering. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. 
  Net operating income is not equivalent to our net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, net operating income is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Net operating income should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. Investors are also cautioned that net operating income should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any acquisition related expenses. 
  We believe that net operating income is useful for investors as it provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because net operating income excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of the properties. We believe that net operating income is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term net operating income may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.

Subsequent Events 
  For a discussion of subsequent events,   see Note 17, Subsequent Events  , to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures, or in the methods we use to manage market risk, from those that were provided for in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties and make loans and other permitted investments. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow or lend at fixed or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivatives or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  
  As of September 30, 2016, the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.    

  Mortgage Loan Payable, Net and Line of Credit  
  Mortgage loan payable was $3,949,000 ($3,847,000, including deferred financing costs) as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had one fixed-rate mortgage loan payable with an effective interest rate of 5.25% per annum. In

     Table of Contents  

addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had $12,000,000 outstanding under the Line of Credit, at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.27% per annum.  
  Other Market Risk 
  In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  (a)   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  (b)   Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016, except as noted below. 
  We have not had sufficient cash available from operations to pay distributions, and therefore, we have paid distributions from the net proceeds of our offering, and in the future, may pay distributions from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows or from other sources. Any such distributions may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets, may negatively impact the value of our stockholders  investment and may cause subsequent investors to experience dilution. 
  Distributions payable to our stockholders may include a return of capital, rather than a return on capital, and it is likely that we will use offering proceeds to fund a majority of our initial distributions. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences. The actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and typically will depend on the amount of funds available for distribution, which will depend on items such as our financial condition, current and projected capital expenditure requirements, tax considerations and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify as a REIT. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. 
  We have used net proceeds from our offering and our advisor has waived certain fees payable to it as discussed below, and in the future, may use the net proceeds from our offering, borrowed funds, or other sources, to pay cash distributions to our stockholders in order to qualify as a REIT, which may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations, cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds or cause subsequent investors to experience dilution. Further, if the aggregate amount of cash distributed in any given year exceeds the amount of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess amount will be deemed a return of capital. 
  On April 13, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period from May 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. Our advisor agreed to waive certain asset management fees that may otherwise be due to our advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement until such time as the amount of such waived asset management fees is equal to the amount of distributions payable to our stockholders for the period beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on the date of the acquisition of our first property or real estate-related investment, as such terms are defined in the Advisory Agreement. Having raised the minimum offering in April 2016, the distributions declared for each record date in the May 2016 and June 2016 periods were paid in June 2016 and July 2016, respectively, from legally available funds. The daily distributions were calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and were equal to   $0.001643836   per share of our Class T common stock. These distributions were aggregated and paid in cash or shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP monthly in arrears. We acquired our first property on June 28, 2016, and as such, our advisor waived asset management fees equal to the amount of distributions paid from May 1, 2016 through June 27, 2016.  
  On June 28, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending September 30, 2016 and to our Class I stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on the date that the first Class I share was sold and ending on September 30, 2016. On September 28, 2016, our board of directors authorized a daily distribution to our Class T and Class I stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on October 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016. The daily distributions were or will be calculated based on 365 days in the calendar year and are equal to   $0.001643836   per share of our Class T and Class I common stock. These distributions were or will be aggregated and paid in cash or shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP monthly in arrears, only from legally available funds. 
  The amount of distributions paid to our stockholders is determined quarterly by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. We have not established any limit on the amount of offering proceeds that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be  
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  

unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences. 
  We did not pay any distributions   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the sources of distributions as compared to cash flows from operations were as follows:   

  Under GAAP, acquisition related expenses are expensed, and therefore, subtracted from cash flows from operations. However, these expenses may be paid from offering proceeds or debt. 
  Our distributions of amounts in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits have resulted in a return of capital to our stockholders, and all or any portion of a distribution to our stockholders may be paid from offering proceeds. The payment of distributions from our offering proceeds could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and negatively impact the amount of income available for future distributions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an amount payable of   $3,835,000   to our advisor or its affiliates primarily for the Contingent Advisor Payment and operating expenses, which will be paid from cash flows from operations in the future as it becomes due and payable by us in the ordinary course of business consistent with our past practice. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates had been deferred, waived or forgiven other than the   $31,000   in asset management fees waived by our advisor discussed above. Other than the waiver of asset management fees by our advisor to provide us with additional funds to pay initial distributions to our stockholders through June 27, 2016, our advisor and its affiliates, including our co-sponsors, have no obligation to defer or forgive fees owed by us to our advisor or its affiliates or to advance any funds to us. In the future, if our advisor or its affiliates do not defer or continue to defer, waive or forgive amounts due to them, this would negatively affect our cash flows from operations, which could result in us paying distributions, or a portion thereof, using borrowed funds. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
  We did not pay distributions   for the period from January 23, 2015 (Date of Inception) through September 30, 2015  . The distributions paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the amount of distributions reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and the sources of our distributions as compared to FFO were as follows:   

  The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as result of borrowed funds. For a further discussion of FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, including a reconciliation of our GAAP net income (loss) to FFO, see Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.

A high concentration of our properties in a particular geographic area would magnify the effects of downturns in that geographic area. 
  To the extent that we have a concentration of properties in any particular geographic area, any adverse situation that disproportionately effects that geographic area would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. As of   November 9, 2016  , our properties located in Alabama, Virginia and Pennsylvania accounted for approximately 49.0%, 25.7% and 10.3%, respectively, of the annualized base rent of our total property portfolio. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state s economy. 
  The U.S. Department of Labor, or DOL, has adopted certain amendments, including an amendment to the definition of  fiduciary  under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, and the Code, which could impact our ability to raise additional capital in our offering. 
  The DOL has adopted certain amendments, including an amendment to the definition of  fiduciary  under ERISA and the Code. The amendments have broadened the definition of  fiduciary  and have changed the prohibited transaction exemptions relating to investments by employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA or retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts). The amendments take effect between April 10, 2017 and January 1, 2018. The ultimate impact of the amendments is not yet known, but when they take effect, they could have a significantly negative effect on the sale of shares of our common stock to such plans or accounts.

  Our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-205960), registering a public offering of up to   $3,150,000,000   in shares of our common stock, was declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, on February 16, 2016. Griffin Capital Securities, Inc. is the dealer manager of our offering. Commencing on February 16, 2016, we offered to the public a minimum of   $2,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock, and a maximum of   $3,000,000,000   in shares of our Class T common stock for $10.00 per share in our primary offering. Effective June 17, 2016, we reallocated certain of the unsold shares being offered, such that we are currently offering up to approximately $2,800,000,000 in shares of Class T common stock at a price of $10.00 per share and $200,000,000 in shares of Class I common stock at a price of $9.30 per share in our primary offering, and up to $150,000,000 in shares of our common stock pursuant to the DRIP at a purchase price of $9.50 per share, aggregating up to $3,150,000,000. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between the primary offering and the DRIP, and among classes of stock. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for   5,374,861   aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or approximately   $53,443,000  , excluding subscriptions from residents in Pennsylvania (who will not be admitted as stockholders until we have received and accepted subscriptions aggregating at least $150,000,000) and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   $222,000   in distributions were reinvested pursuant to the DRIP and   23,379   shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to the DRIP. 
  Our equity raise as of   September 30, 2016   resulted in the following:
