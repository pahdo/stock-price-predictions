PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION       ITEM 1. CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.       BUSCAR COMPANY.     Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements.             BUSCAR COMPANY.     Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations     (Unaudited)            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements.             BUSCAR COMPANY.     Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows     (Unaudited)            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements.             Buscar Company     Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements        Note 1   Business       Buscar Company. ("Buscar", "we", "us", "our", the "Company") was incorporated in Nevada as Cascade Springs Ltd. on January 19, 2010.  In 2012, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Colorado Gold Mines, Inc. On June 18, 2014, changed our name to Buscar Oil, Inc. On May 19, 2015, the Company changed it's name to Buscar Company. On April 22, 2016, Buscar incorporated a wholly-owned California subsidiary, Buscar Stables, Inc. ("Buscar Stables"). Buscar is domiciled in the state of Colorado, and its corporate headquarters are located in Los Angeles, CA. The Company selected March 31 as its fiscal year end.        The Company's primary business is the breeding and selling of thoroughbreds, through its wholly owned subsidiary Buscar Stables. The Company will breed in California.  The Company expects that it will need to raise $5,500,000 to fully execute its breeding program.  The breeding program consists of the Company acquiring broodmares and paying stud fees to farms who own the studs.  The breeding season typically runs from February through May.  Under the rules of racing, every foal (a baby thoroughbred) is given a birthday of January 1 of the year of its birth regardless of its actual date of birth.  The Company will generate revenue from its breeding operations through the sale of the foals and purse winnings from the foals the Company keeps.  While the Company is building its breeding operations, the Company will own and manage thoroughbreds that will race in allowance or stakes races.  This will allow the Company to begin to develop relationships with other owners and trainers for the benefit of its breeding operations.        Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Presentation of Interim Financial Statements      The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017. Notes to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 have been omitted. This report should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company's Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2016.      Consolidation Policy      For September 30, 2016, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Buscar Stables, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.             Thoroughbreds      The Company depreciates thoroughbreds via straight-line depreciation over its useful life of 3 years.     The thoroughbreds are stated at the lower of cost or market value. The cost was deemed to be the best evidence of market value and the company's thoroughbreds were therefore stated at cost. Costs of maintaining horses prior to maturity and entered into a race or disposition are capitalized as additional costs of the horse. When a horse is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations.     The company evaluates the recoverability of its Long Term Assets in accordance with ASC topic 360, which requires recognition of impairments of long lived assets in the event an indication of impairment exists and the net book value of such assets exceeds the expected future value net cash flows attainable to such assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.            Thoroughbred Revenue Recognition      The Company pursues opportunities to realize revenues from a principal activity: breeding the thoroughbreds. It is the Company's policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25, "Revenue Recognition." Under ASC Topic 605-10-25, revenue earning activities such as selling the horses and the Company has substantially accomplished all it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenue. Gains or losses from the sale of the horses are recognized when the horse is sold, and the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.       Note 3   Going Concern       These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, has accumulated losses of $17,058,127 since its inception, has a working capital of $233,165 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available or on terms acceptable to the Company.              Note 4   Due to Related Parties       During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed a total amount of $191,796 from a shareholder, who is also married to our CEO of the Company, and repaid $88,430 for payments of operating expenses and purchase of thoroughbreds.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded due to a shareholder of $130,166.     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $7,500 to a shareholder, who is also a former officer of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded due to shareholder of $5,871 for payments of operating expense on behalf of the Company.     As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company owed related parties $136,037 and $40,171, respectively.       Note 5   Commitments and Contingencies       As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a total of $313,792 of outstanding liabilities. As of this date, the Company recognized $177,270 of outstanding liabilities related to previous Company directors, Robert Sawatsky and Kelly Fielder. The Company's legal counsel believes that the outstanding liabilities are expected to be paid back to the previous Company directors, Robert Sawatsky and Kelly Fielder, who had originally loaned money to the Company. However, there has been no resolution of this event.       Note 6   Equity       On July 7, 2016, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to amend the par value of preferred stock and common stock to $0.0001. Preferred share and common share amounts in these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this change in par value.       Preferred Stock       The Company has authorized 50,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Board of Directors are authorized to divide the authorized shares of Preferred Stock into one or more series, each of which shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes.      Series A Preferred Stock      The Company has designated 10,000,000 preferred shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had 8,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.      Series B Preferred Stock      The Company has designated 10,000,000 preferred shares of Series B Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued to our CEO for the par value as there is no stated value.     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, 35,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted at rate of 1 preferred share to 400 common shares, resulting in the issuance of 14,000,000 shares of common stock, for a value of $1,400, of which $1,397 was recorded as a deemed dividend.     As at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had 9,965,000 and 0 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.              Common Stock       The Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.     During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued common shares, as follows:           As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had 16,771,321 and 372,375 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.       Note 7   Subsequent events       On November 7, 2016, the Company began attending the Keeneland November sale.  At the auction the Company acquired Milania (Hip 13) for $310,000 and Sweet Dreams (Hip 80) for $180,000. The Company acquired the mares through our bloodstock agents and owns 100% of each mare.  The mares are the initial acquisition on the part of the company to build out its breeding division.  Both mares are currently pregnant and expected to deliver in February or March 2017. The mares were transported from Keeneland (which is located in Keeneland, Kentucky) to a farm outside of Lexington, Kentucky. The Company s goal is to sell the mares offspring at the Keeneland November 2017 and to stud the mares again in March/April 2017.      Milania (Hip 13) is carrying a colt sired by Pioneerof the Nile.  She is expected to give birth in February or March 2017. Pioneerof the Nile is among the leading sires with 4 crops of racing age that includes the following: 329 foals, 174 starters, 16 black-type winners, 128 winners of 271 races and earnings of $19,914,401, including triple crown champion American Pharoah. Pioneerof the Nile s colt weanlings have so far sold for an average of $360,000 in 2016. The Company expects to sell her offspring as a weanling at the 2017 November sale and stud her to a new sire in March 2017.  Milania was sired by Bernardini who was a Champion 3-year-old colt who won $3,060,480 including the Preakness. Milania s dam is Keeper Hill who won $1,661,281 and multiple stakes races including the Kentucky Oaks.            Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation      The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     As used in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation," except where the context otherwise requires, the term "we," "us," or "our," refers to the business of Buscar Company.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our accompanying financial statements.     Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company, we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC.     We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of our financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.     Although we are still evaluating the JOBS Act, it currently intends to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an "emerging growth company". We have elected not to opt out of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us. As a result, investor confidence in us and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.      Use of Estimates      Financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things, management makes estimates relating to the fair value of financial instruments and the valuation allowance related to deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.            Stock-Based Compensation      We periodically issue stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. We account for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 718, "Compensation - Stock Compensation", whereas the award is measured at its fair value at the date of grant and is amortized ratably over the service period. We account for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505, "Equity", whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.      Results of Operations and Financial Condition for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015            We have not generated any revenues as of September 30, 2016.     Operating expense increased to $1,256,223 from $10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the increase in management and consulting fees that resulted from stock based compensation issuances.     Operating expense increased to $1,795,339 from $167,402 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the increase in management and consulting fees that resulted from stock based compensation issuances.     There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.            Liquidity and Capital Resources            As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had cash of $546,957 and $0 respectively. Our cash position is insufficient and as such we plan to raise additional debt and equity financing to meet our obligations as they become due.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.      Timing needs for Funding       Immediate needs (current through December 2016)      $1,375,000: This capital is intended to be used to acquire broodmares and weanlings. The $1,375,000 is broken down as follows: $600,000 to acquire broodmares and weanlings, $375,000 for stud fees, $141,000 for reserve for fees associated with the thoroughbreds acquired (i.e. training and vet) and $250,000 in working capital. The Company expects the monthly costs of the thoroughbreds to be approximately $5,000 per month. The Company s reserve of $141,000 is for the thoroughbred s monthly costs.     The Company will be attending auctions in November 2016 with the intent of acquiring weanlings that can be resold in September 2017 auctions and broodmares that can be resold in November 2017 after being studded to a top Kentucky stallion. This will allow the company to begin generating revenue from its breeding operation next year.      The Company expects its on-going monthly expenses directly associated to the thoroughbreds in its breeding division to be approximately $10 to $17 per day for each broodmare.      The expenses directly associated to each thoroughbred acquired are $10-$17 per day depending on the trainer and the vet needs of each thoroughbred. The Company's current monthly burn rate is between $18,000   20,000 per month, which includes approximately $2,000 for training fees associated with the Company s thoroughbreds, $15,000 is general corporate expenses and approximately $2,000 associated with being a reporting company. The Company's monthly burn rate consists of the direct costs of the thoroughbreds the Company has acquired (such as training and vet fees) and the expected on-going general expenses of the Company (such as filing fees, audits and general administrative expenses).           The Company has included the $141,000 reserve since the Company expects it will take approximately 12-24 months from the date a broodmare is acquired before revenue may be generated from sale of foal, depending if the foal is sold as a yearling or 2-year-old. The Company expects to begin generating revenue within 12 -24 months of the acquisition of the broodmare as such the on-going monthly burn rate should be covered by the revenue generated from the sale of foals. However, there is no guarantee that the Company's revenue would be able to cover the Company's monthly burn rate.     If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate, the Company would be required to raise additional funds to cover those expenses. The Company will not know the amount that would be required to be raised to cover the monthly burn rate until the Company is able to determine what its monthly revenue is.     If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate and the Company cannot raise additional funds to cover those expenses, then the Company would have to sell its broodmares. This may require the Company to sell its thoroughbreds for less than the Company purchased.      Short-term needs (January through December 2017)      $3,000,000: This capital is intended to be used to acquire the additional broodmares and weanlings. The $3,000,000 is broken down as follows: $1,500,000 to acquire broodmares, $975,000 for stud fees, $275,000 for reserve for fees associated with the thoroughbreds acquires (i.e. training and vet) and $250,000 in working capital. The Company expects the monthly costs of the thoroughbreds to be approximately $5,000 per month. The Company s reserve of $275,000 for the monthly costs is intended for the expenses for the broodmares acquired.      The Company expects its on-going monthly expenses directly associated to the thoroughbreds in its breeding division to be approximately $10 to $17 per day for each broodmare.      The expenses directly associated to each thoroughbred acquired are $10-$17 per day depending on the trainer and the vet needs of each thoroughbred. The Company's current monthly burn rate is between $18,000   20,000 per month, which includes approximately $2,000 for training fees associated with the Company s thoroughbreds, $15,000 is general corporate expenses and approximately $2,000 associated with being a reporting company. The Company's monthly burn rate consists of the direct costs of the thoroughbreds the Company has acquired (such as training and vet fees) and the expected on-going general expenses of the Company (such as filing fees, audits and general administrative expenses).     The Company has included the $275,000 reserve since the Company expects it will take approximately 12-24 months from the date a broodmare is acquired before revenue may be generated from sale of foal, depending if the foal is sold as a yearling or 2-year-old. The Company expects to begin generating revenue within 12 -24 months of the acquisition of the broodmare as such the on-going monthly burn rate should be covered by the revenue generated from the sale of foals. However, there is no guarantee that the Company's revenue would be able to cover the Company's monthly burn rate.     If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate, the Company would be required to raise additional funds to cover those expenses. The Company will not know the amount that would be required to be raised to cover the monthly burn rate until the Company is able to determine what its monthly revenue is.           If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate and the Company cannot raise additional funds to cover those expenses, then the Company would have to sell its broodmares. This may require the Company to sell its thoroughbreds for less than the Company purchased.      Long-term needs (January through December 2018)      $5,500,000: This capital is intended to be used to acquire additional broodmares and weanlings. The $5,500,000 is broken down as follows: $2,700,000 to acquire broodmares, $2,000,000 for stud fees, $450,000 for reserve for fees associated with the thoroughbreds acquires (i.e. training and vet) and $250,000 in working capital. The Company expects the monthly costs of the thoroughbreds to be approximately $5,000 per month. The Company s reserve of $450,000 for the monthly costs is intended for the expenses for the broodmares acquired.      The Company expects its on-going monthly expenses directly associated to the thoroughbreds in its breeding division to be approximately $10 to $17 per day for each broodmare.      The expenses directly associated to each thoroughbred acquired are $10-$17 per day depending on the trainer and the vet needs of each thoroughbred. The Company's current monthly burn rate is between $18,000   20,000 per month, which includes approximately $2,000 for training fees associated with the Company s thoroughbreds, $15,000 is general corporate expenses and approximately $2,000 associated with being a reporting company. The Company's monthly burn rate consists of the direct costs of the thoroughbreds the Company has acquired (such as training and vet fees) and the expected on-going general expenses of the Company (such as filing fees, audits and general administrative expenses).     The Company has included the $450,000 reserve since the Company expects it will take approximately 12-24 months from the date a broodmare is acquired before revenue may be generated from sale of foal, depending if the foal is sold as a yearling or 2-year-old. The Company expects to begin generating revenue within 12 -24 months of the acquisition of the broodmare as such the on-going monthly burn rate should be covered by the revenue generated from the sale of foals. However, there is no guarantee that the Company's revenue would be able to cover the Company's monthly burn rate.     If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate, the Company would be required to raise additional funds to cover those expenses. The Company will not know the amount that would be required to be raised to cover the monthly burn rate until the Company is able to determine what its monthly revenue is.     If the Company's revenue is not sufficient to cover the monthly burn rate and the Company cannot raise additional funds to cover those expenses, then the Company would have to sell its broodmares. This may require the Company to sell its thoroughbreds for less than the Company purchased.      Dividend Policy      The Company has not paid dividends on its Common Stock in the past. The Company has decided to distribute at least 16% of its net purse winnings that the Company s thoroughbreds generate. However, our ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by Nevada law. Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute 78.288, dividends may be paid to the extent that a corporation s assets exceed it liabilities and it is able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.      Going Concern      We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive exploration activities. For these reasons our auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern.            Accounting and Audit Plan      In the next twelve months, we anticipate spending approximately $20,000 - $30,000 to pay for our accounting and audit requirements.      Off-balance sheet arrangements      We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
