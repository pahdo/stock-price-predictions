Note 1   Organization and Basis of Presentation  
    
  Business Development Corporation of America (the  Company ), incorporated in Maryland on May 5, 2010, is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ) and is applying the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 946, "  Financial Services - Investment Companies  " ("ASC 946"). The Company is, therefore, required to comply with certain regulatory requirements as promulgated under the 1940 Act. The Company is managed by BDCA Adviser, LLC (the  Adviser ) pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Services Agreement, as amended (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ). The Adviser was formed in Delaware as a private investment management firm and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the  Advisers Act ). The Adviser oversees the management of the Company's activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for its portfolio. Through the period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Adviser was indirectly, wholly-owned by the sponsor, AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global" or the "Sponsor").  
    
  The Company's investment objective is to generate both current income and to a lesser extent long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company invests primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans and mezzanine debt issued by middle market companies. The Company defines middle market companies as those with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. The Company may also purchase interests in loans through secondary market transactions in the "over-the-counter" market for institutional loans. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in bankruptcy priority and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. The Company may invest in the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles ( Collateralized Securities ). Structurally, Collateralized Securities are entities that are formed to manage a portfolio of senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade or, in limited circumstances, unrated. The senior secured loans within these Collateralized Securities meet specified credit and diversity criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to create a diverse investment portfolio. The Company expects that each investment generally will range between approximately 0.5% to 3.0% of its total assets. In most cases, companies to whom the Company provides customized financing solutions will be privately held at the time it invests in them. 
    
  On January 25, 2011, the Company commenced its initial public offering (the  IPO ) on a  reasonable best efforts basis  of up to   150.0 million   shares of common stock,   $0.001   par value per share, at an initial offering price of   $10.00   per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-166636) (the  Registration Statement ) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company sold   22,222   shares of common stock to its Adviser on July 8, 2010 at   $9.00   per share, which represented the initial public offering price of   $10.00   per share minus selling commissions of   $0.70   per share and dealer manager fees of   $0.30   per share.  On August 25, 2011, the Company had raised sufficient funds to break escrow on its IPO and commenced operations as of that date. On February 1, 2012, the Adviser contributed an additional $1.3 million to purchase 140,784 shares of our common stock at $9.234 per share so that the aggregate contribution by the Adviser was $1.5 million. The Adviser will not tender any amount of its shares for repurchase as long it continues to serve as our investment adviser. On July 1, 2014, the Company's registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-193241) for its follow-on offering (the "Follow-on") was declared effective by the SEC. Simultaneously with the effectiveness of the registration statement of the Follow-on, the Company's IPO terminated. Under the Follow-on, the Company offered up to 101,100,000 shares of its common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued   180.9 million   shares of common stock for gross proceeds of   $2.0   billion including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and shares issued under the Company's distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP"). Following the time the Company's updated registration statement was declared effective on June 30, 2015, the Company issued shares for subscription agreements that had been accepted through that date. Other than shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, the Company has not issued any new shares of common stock since July 1, 2015. 
       
  In addition, the Company is only allowed to borrow money such that the asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities (excluding borrowings) to total borrowings, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. The Company may use borrowed funds, known as  leverage,  to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to stockholders by reducing the overall cost of capital. The Company currently

has credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), Citibank, N.A. ( Citi ), and UBS AG, London Branch ("UBS") and has sold $100.0 million in aggregate principal of senior notes. The Company previously had a credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch ("Deutsche Bank") which was terminated in June 2016.  
       
  The Company has formed and expects to continue to form consolidated subsidiaries (the "Consolidated Holding Companies") to hold equity securities of portfolio companies. These Consolidated Holding Companies enable the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. Any tax payable by the Consolidated Holding Companies are included as an expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , 54th Street Equity Holdings, Inc., Kahala Aviation Holdings, LLC, Kahala Aviation US, Inc., Kahala LuxCo, and Park Ave RE, Inc. were the only Consolidated Holding Companies. 
    
  On February 10, 2016, AR Global received written notice from American National Stock Transfer, LLC ("ANST"), the Company's transfer agent and an affiliate of Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager"), that it would wind down operations by the end of the month. ANST withdrew as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. Subsequently, effective February 26, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with its previous third party provider of sub-transfer agency services to provide the Company directly with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services). 
    
  American Realty Capital II Advisors, LLC (the  Seller ), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of AR Global, the Sponsor of the Company, informed the Company that on July 19, 2016, the Seller entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with BSP Acquisition I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Purchaser ), a subsidiary of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. ( Benefit Street ). The Purchase Agreement provides, among other things, that the Seller would sell 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, to the Purchaser. 
    
  If the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the  Transaction ) is consummated, then it is expected to constitute an  assignment  (within the meaning of the 1940 Act) of the Third Amended and Restated Advisory and Management Services Agreement (the "Existing Advisory Agreement"). An assignment of the Existing Advisory Agreement would result in the termination of the Existing Advisory Agreement in accordance with its terms. A special committee comprised solely of the Company s independent directors (the  Special Committee ) is responsible for the review and approval of the new investment advisory agreement with the Adviser (the "New Advisory Agreement") that would go into effect if the Transaction is completed, subject to approval by the Company s stockholders as required by the 1940 Act (the  Stockholder Approval ). On August 12, 2016, the board of directors, including the members of the Special Committee, met in person and heard a further presentation from Benefit Street, discussed the Transaction and its possible effects on the Company, and evaluated the New Advisory Agreement. Senior officers of the Adviser and Benefit Street were present to answer questions from the board of directors. The board of directors, including all the members of the Special Committee, unanimously approved the New Advisory Agreement on August 12, 2016. See  Note 15 - Subsequent Events  for additional information regarding the closing of the Transaction, which occurred on November 1, 2016. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 
    
  The Company consolidates the following subsidiaries for accounting purposes: BDCA Funding I, LLC ("Funding I"), BDCA 2L Funding I, LLC ("2L Funding I"), BDCA-CB Funding, LLC ("CB Funding"), BDCA Helvetica Funding, Ltd. ("Helvetica Funding"), and the Consolidated Holding Companies.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In conjunction with the consolidation of subsidiaries, the Company recognizes non-controlling interests attributable to third party ownership in the following Consolidated Holding Companies: Kahala Aviation Holdings, LLC, Kahala Aviation US, Inc., and Kahala LuxCo.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated) 
  For the period ended September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, as appropriate. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements may not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2016. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company or controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the accounts of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
    
  Portfolio investments are reported on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value. On a quarterly basis the Company performs an analysis of each investment to determine fair value as follows: 
    
  Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of the Company's investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined readily available, the Company uses the quote obtained. 
    
  Investments without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in fair value pricing the Company's investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. 
    
  For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company measures the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 946, as of the Company's measurement date.  
    
  For investments in Collateralized Securities, both the assets and liabilities of each Collateralized Securities' capital structure are modeled. The model uses a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate collateral cash flows from the assets, and distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on the priority of payments. The waterfall cash flows are

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated) 
  For the period ended September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

discounted using rates that incorporate risk factors such as default risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk, among others. In addition, broker quotations and/or comparable trade activity is considered as an input to determining fair value when available.   
    
  As part of the Company's quarterly valuation process the Adviser may be assisted by one or more independent valuation firms engaged by the Company. The board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser and the the independent valuation firm(s) (to the extent applicable). 
    
  With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:  

Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by the Adviser, potentially with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by the board of directors;  

The independent valuation firm(s), if involved, will conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and 

The board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of the board of directors.  
       
  Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in its portfolio, the Company values substantially all of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by its board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company's investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize.  Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities.  If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. 
       
  Investment Classification 
    
  The Company classifies its investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, "control" is defined as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company. In addition, any person "who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25 per centum of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed to control such company. Any person who does not so own more than 25 per centum of the voting securities of any company shall be presumed not to control such company". Using this definition, the Company has determined to treat  Control Investments  as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities, maintains greater than 50% of the board representation or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. Consistent with the 1940 Act,  Affiliated Investments  are defined as those non-control investments in companies in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities. Consistent with the 1940 Act,  Non-affiliated Investments  are defined as investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliated Investments.  
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, liquid investments in a money market deposit account. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value.  
    
  Offering Costs 
    
    The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the registration of shares of its common stock. Offering costs principally relate to professional fees, printing costs, direct marketing expenses, due diligence costs, fees paid to regulators and other expenses, including the expenses of the Adviser and its affiliates engaged in registering and marketing the Company s

  (Unaudited) 

common stock.  Such allocated expenses of the Adviser and its affiliates may include the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company.  
    
  Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company and the Adviser have agreed that the Company will not be liable for organization and offering costs, including transfer agent fees, in excess of   1.5%   of the aggregate gross proceeds from the Company s on-going offering. Should the Company resume continually offering its shares, any offering costs incurred will be capitalized and amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over a 12 month period. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, offering costs have not been incurred in excess of the 1.5% limit.  
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Financing costs incurred in connection with the Company s unsecured notes and revolving credit facilities with Wells Fargo, Citi, and UBS are capitalized and amortized into expense using the straight-line method over the life of the respective facility. See Note 5 - Borrowings - for details on the Credit Facilities and unsecured notes.  
    
  Distributions 
    
  The Company s board of directors has authorized, and the Company has declared cash distributions payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on each day since it commenced operations. Since November 2013, the distribution rate has been $0.002378082 per day, which is equivalent to $0.868 per annum, per share of common stock. In March 2016, the Company s board of directors ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to $0.868 per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution amount to $0.002371585 per day per share of common stock, effective January 1, 2016, to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year.   
    
  The amount of each such distribution will be subject to the discretion of the board of directors and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. The Company will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates and accrue distributions on the date the Company accepts a subscription for shares of the Company s common stock. The distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. From time to time, the Company may also pay interim distributions, including capital gains distributions, at the discretion of the Company s board of directors. The Company s distributions may exceed earnings, especially during the period before it has substantially invested the proceeds from the offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions made by the Company may represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital is a return of each stockholder s investment rather than earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. 
    
    The Company may fund cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to the Company, including expense payments from the Adviser that are subject to reimbursement, as well as offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets, and non-capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. See Note 12 - Income Tax Information and Distributions to Stockholders for additional information. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Interest Income 
    
  Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the expected life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premiums on investments. 
    
  The Company has a number of investments in Collateralized Securities.  Interest income from investments in the "equity" class of these Collateralized Securities (in the Company's case, preferred shares or subordinated notes) is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC Topic 325-40-35, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The Company monitors the expected cash inflows from its  
  
   29 

    BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF AMERICA 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated) 
  For the period ended September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

equity investments in Collateralized Securities, including the expected principal repayments.  The effective yield is determined and updated quarterly. 
  Fee Income 
  Fee income, such as structuring fees, origination, closing, amendment fees, commitment and other upfront fees are generally non-recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned, either upfront or amortized into income. Upon the payment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees are recorded as income. 
  Payment-in-Kind Interest/Dividends 
    
  The Company holds debt and equity investments in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest and dividend provisions. The PIK interest and PIK dividend, which represent contractually deferred interest or dividends that add to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, are generally recorded on the accrual basis. 
    
  Non-accrual income 
    
  Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest/dividend payments are past due 30 days and/or more and/or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest is generally reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest is not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. 
    
  Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
    
  Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation will reflect the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
    
  Income Taxes  
    
  The Company has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Generally, a RIC is exempt from federal income taxes if it distributes to its stockholders at least 90% of   investment company taxable income,   as defined in the Code, each year. Distributions declared prior to the filing of the previous year's tax return and paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions to maintain its RIC status each year. The Company may be subject to federal excise taxes of 4%. See Note 12 - Income Tax Information and Distributions to Stockholders for additional information. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard has on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated) 
  For the period ended September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  . The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share practical expedient. Sufficient information must be provided to permit reconciliation of the fair value of assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The guidance is required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Accordingly, the Company adopted ASU 2015-07, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which removes investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  The ASU requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability.  The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 14, 2015.  The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and adjusted prior period balance sheets to reflect the change. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which amends the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity ("VIE") guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU 2015-02 changes the manner in which a reporting entity assesses one of the five characteristics that determine if an entity is a VIE. Accordingly, the Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
    Accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability of inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. 
    
  The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, if any, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
       
  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the above hierarchy requires significant judgment and factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement

falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. 
    
  All of the Company s investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was comprised of debt and equity instruments for which Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices, were not available. Therefore, at   September 30, 2016  , the investments were valued at fair value as determined in good faith using the valuation policy approved by the board of directors using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which the Company's investments are trading, in determining fair value. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, the estimate of fair value of the Company s investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016   may differ materially from values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. 
    
  In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company continues to employ the valuation policy approved by the board of directors. Portfolio investments are reported on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value. On a quarterly basis the Company performs an analysis of each investment to determine fair value as described below. 
    
  Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of the Company's investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined reliable and readily available, the Company uses the quote obtained. 
    
  Investments without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in fair value pricing the Company's investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. 
    
  For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company measures the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC Topic 946, as of the Company's measurement date.  
    
  For investments in Collateralized Securities, the Adviser models both the assets and liabilities of each Collateralized Securities' capital structure. The model uses a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate collateral cash flows from the assets, and distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on priority of payments. The waterfall cash flows are discounted using rates that incorporate risk factors such as default risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk, among others. In addition, the Adviser considers broker quotations and/or comparable trade activity as an input to determining fair value when available.   
    
  As part of the Company's quarterly valuation process, the Adviser may be assisted by one or more independent valuation firms engaged by the Company. The board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser and the independent valuation firm(s) (to the extent applicable). 
    
  Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations on the consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, AR Global became the successor business to AR Capital, LLC and became the parent of the Company's current Sponsor. 
    
  The Company has entered into the Amended and Restated Administration Servicing Agreement and the Amended and Restated Accounting Servicing Agreement with US Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the  Administrator ). The Administrator provides services, such as accounting, financial reporting, legal and compliance support and investor relations support, necessary for the Company to operate. On August 13, 2012, the Company entered into a custody agreement with U.S. Bank National Association ( U.S. Bank ). Under the custody agreement, U.S. Bank holds all of the portfolio securities and cash of the Company and for certain of its subsidiaries, and transfers such securities or cash pursuant to the Company s instructions. The custody agreement is terminable by either party, without penalty, on not less than ninety days prior notice to the other party.  
    
  On February 9, 2016, the Company and ARC Advisory Services, LLC ( ARC Advisory ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company s Sponsor, entered into an agreement for ARC Advisory to provide the Company with administrative services necessary for the Company s operation  (the  ARC Administration Agreement ). Pursuant to the ARC Administration Agreement, ARC Advisory provides the Company with, among other things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services.  In addition, ARC Advisory assists the Company in determining and publishing the Company s net asset value and the filing of the Company s tax returns. The Company will reimburse ARC Advisory for the costs and expenses incurred by ARC Advisory in performing its obligations pursuant to the ARC Administration Agreement. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events - for a discussion of the Company's new administration agreement with Benefit Street. 
    
  Management and Incentive Fee Compensation to the Adviser  
    
  The Adviser receives fees for the investment and management of the Company s assets. The Adviser is entitled to an annual base management fee calculated at an annual rate of   1.5%   of the Company s average gross assets. The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and shall be calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated. In addition, any management fees waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment at a later date.  
    
  The incentive fee consists of two parts.  The first part is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the Company, pursuant to an affirmative vote of stockholders at the Company s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, entered into the Existing Advisory Agreement between the Company and its investment adviser, BDCA Adviser, LLC (the  Adviser ). The Existing Advisory Agreement amends the manner in which the income incentive fee payable by the Company to the Adviser is earned and calculated. Specifically, under the Existing Advisory Agreement, the hurdle rate required for the Adviser to earn, and be paid, the income incentive fee is expressed as a percentage of the Company s net assets rather than  Adjusted Capital  (as defined below), as it was previously calculated under the then-existing advisory and management services agreement (the  Prior Advisory Agreement ).  
       
  Under the Existing Advisory Agreement, the applicable percentages related to the incentive fee on income, including the hurdle rate, remain the same as those in the Prior Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, the incentive fee on income will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equal 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the Company s net assets, equal to 1.75% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.0%.  
    
  The Prior Advisory Agreement defined  Adjusted Capital  to mean the amount of money received from sales of the Company s common stock (including reinvested dividends) minus distributions paid to stockholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. 
    
  The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the Company s portfolio and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Existing Advisory Agreement). This fee equals   20.0%   of the Company s incentive fee capital gains, which equals the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a

cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. Incentive fees waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment at a later date.  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred $  9.5   million and $  28.5   million, respectively, of management fees, of which the Adviser did not waive any portion of such fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $  9.4   million and $  26.5   million, respectively, of management fees, of which the Adviser did not waive any portion of such fees.  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred $  7.9   million and $  14.8   million, respectively, of subordinated incentive fees on income, of which the Adviser did not waive any portion of such fees.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred zero and $  10.1   million, respectively, of subordinated incentive fees on income, of which the Adviser waived zero and $3.5 million, respectively.  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, the Company did not incur any capital gains incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  
    
  For accounting purposes only, the Company is required under U.S. GAAP to also accrue a theoretical capital gains incentive fee based upon unrealized capital appreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this theoretical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation is realized in order to reflect a capital gains incentive fee that would theoretically be payable to the Adviser. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not incur any theoretical capital gains incentive fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a reduction of $0.5 million of theoretical capital gains incentive fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $0.9 million of theoretical capital gains incentive fees. The amounts actually paid to the Adviser will be consistent with the Advisers Act and formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital appreciation.  
    
  Expense Support Agreement 
    
  The Adviser and its affiliates may incur and pay costs and fees on behalf of the Company. The Company and its Adviser have entered into the Expense Support Agreement ("Expense Support Agreement"), whereby the Adviser may pay the Company up to   100%   of all operating expenses ( Expense Support Payment ) for any period beginning November 4, 2011, the date our prior registration statement on Form N-2 was declared effective, and continuing until the Adviser and the Company mutually agree otherwise. The Expense Support Payment for any month shall be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offsets against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser. 
    
  Operating expenses subject to this agreement include expenses as defined by U.S. GAAP, including, without limitation, advisory fees payable and interest on indebtedness for such period, if any. 
    
  Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Adviser for Expense Support Payments within three years of the date that the Expense Support Payment obligation was incurred by the Adviser, subject to the conditions described below. The amount of any reimbursement during any calendar quarter will be limited to an amount that does not cause the Company's other operating expenses to exceed 1.5% of its net assets attributable to common shares after taking such reimbursement payment into account. 
        
  In addition, the Company will only make reimbursement payments if its  operating expense ratio  (as described in footnote 1 to the table below) is equal to or less than its operating expense ratio at the time the corresponding expense payment was incurred and if the annualized rate of the Company's regular cash distributions to stockholders is equal to or greater than the annualized rate of its regular cash distributions to stockholders at the time the corresponding expense payment was incurred. 
    
  Below is a table that provides information regarding Expense Support Payment obligations incurred by the Adviser pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement as well as other information relating to the Company's ability to reimburse the Adviser for such payments. The amounts presented in the first column below, except as noted, are subject to reimbursement to the Adviser pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement:

  The Company has recorded $  0.2   million and $0.2 million as due to affiliate, net on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which reflects the netting of amounts due from the Adviser and affiliates and amounts due from the Company. On August 24, 2012, the Adviser made a payment to the Company in the amount of $0.8 million for $1.0 million of operating expenses pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement netted against $0.2 million due from the Company to the Adviser as reimbursement for payments made by the Adviser on behalf of the Company.  
    
  Offering Costs 
    
  The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the registration of shares of its common stock. Offering costs principally relate to professional fees, printing costs, direct marketing expenses, due diligence costs, fees paid to regulators and other expenses, including the salaries and/or expenses of the Adviser and its affiliates engaged in registering and marketing the Company s common stock. Such allocated expenses of the Adviser and its affiliates may include the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company.

Other Affiliates  
    
    The Company has entered into agreements with affiliates of the Sponsor, whereby it has paid and/or may in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Adviser, its affiliates and entities under common ownership with the Adviser in connection with items such as acquisition and financing activities, sales and maintenance of common stock under its IPO, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. The predecessor to AR Global is a party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ( RCS Advisory ), pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided the Company and certain other companies sponsored by AR Global with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. The predecessor to AR Global instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided by RCS Advisory. The Company was also party to a transfer agency agreement with ANST, pursuant to which ANST provided the Company with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by a third-party transfer agent.  
    
  On February 10, 2016, AR Global received written notice from ANST that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. Subsequently, effective February 26, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with DST Systems, Inc., its previous provider of sub-transfer agency services, to directly provide the Company with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services).

As of   September 30, 2016  , offering costs payable no longer includes offering costs that are payable to third parties. In prior periods, offering costs payable to third parties were included in due (to)/from affiliate as they were an offset to the organization and offering costs in excess of 1.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds from the Company s on-going offering that were the responsibility of the Adviser. Total organization and offering costs do not exceed 1.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds at   September 30, 2016   so offering costs payable to third parties is no longer applicable as an offsetting balance in due (to)/from affiliate.

  UBS Credit Facility           
  On April 7, 2015, the Company, through a wholly-owned, special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Helvetica Funding, entered into a debt financing facility with UBS AG, London Branch ( UBS ), pursuant to which $150.0 million will be made available to the Company to fund investments in new securities and for other general corporate purposes (the  UBS Credit Facility ).

  Unsecured Notes           
  On August 26, 2015, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers, relating to the Company s sale of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% fixed rate senior notes due 2020 to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and for initial resale by the Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (the "Unsecured Notes"). The Company relied upon these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers. The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities under the Securities Act. The Unsecured Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The net proceeds from the sale of the Unsecured Notes was approximately $97.9 million, after deducting Initial Purchasers  discounts and commissions of approximately $1.6 million payable by the Company and estimated offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million payable by the Company. The Company used the net proceeds to make investments in accordance with the Company s investment objectives and for general corporate purposes. 
       
  The Unsecured Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 31, 2015, between the Company and the Trustee. The Unsecured Notes will mature on September 1, 2020, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time, or from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per year payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2016. The Unsecured Notes will be general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of the Company s secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness incurred by the Company s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities, including credit facilities held by the Company s wholly owned, special purpose financing subsidiaries.

Note 9   Share Repurchase Program 
    
  The Company intends to conduct semi-annual tender offers pursuant to its share repurchase program ("SRP"). The Company s board of directors will consider the following factors, among others, in making its determination regarding whether to cause the Company to offer to repurchase shares and under what terms:  

the effect of such repurchases on the Company's qualification as a RIC (including the consequences of any necessary asset sales); 

the liquidity of the Company's assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of assets); 

the Company's investment plans and working capital requirements; 

the relative economies of scale with respect to the Company's size; 

the Company's history in repurchasing shares or portions thereof; and 

the condition of the securities markets. 

On March 8, 2016, the Company's board of directors amended the Company's SRP. The Company will conduct tender offers on a semi-annual basis, instead of on a quarterly basis as was done previously. The Company will continue to limit the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 5.0% at each semi-annual tender offer. In addition, in the event of a stockholder s death or disability, any repurchases of shares made in connection with a stockholder s death or disability may be included within the overall limitation imposed on tender offers during the relevant redemption period, which provides that the Company may limit the number of shares to be repurchased during any redemption period to the number of shares of common stock the Company is able to repurchase with the proceeds received from the sale of shares of common stock under the DRIP during such redemption period.  

Share amounts in the table above represent amounts filed in the tender offer.  
    
  In light of the announced proposed strategic sale of the Adviser to a subsidiary of Benefit Street, the Company announced on July 26, 2016 that it had amended and extended its previously announced tender offer to acquire up to 8,610,409 shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to $8.86 per share, which represented the Company s net asset

value per share at March 31, 2016. The tender offer was due to expire at 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on July 27, 2016. The Company s board of directors approved amending the tender offer to: (i) increase the offer to purchase from up to 8,610,409 to up to 17,220,818, which represents 10.0% of the weighted average number of the Company s shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, at a price equal to the Company s net asset value per share as of September 30, 2016; and (ii) extend the duration of the tender offer to December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company s board of directors amended the Company s share repurchase program, solely with respect to 2016, to permit an annual tender offer, instead of two semi-annual tender offers. All other provisions of the share repurchase program will continue to apply, including limiting the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, and limiting funding for repurchases in any redemption period to proceeds received during that same period through the sale of common stock under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. 
    
  The Company s board of directors approved the amendments and extension of the tender offer and the amendment to the share repurchase program in light of the announced proposed strategic sale of BDCA Adviser to Benefit Street and the required approval of both a special committee, which is comprised of the independent directors of the Company s board of directors, and the Company s stockholders. None of the shares of the Company s common stock previously tendered under the original tender offer were purchased and, as a result of the amendment and extension of the tender offer, all of such shares will remain pending acceptance by the Company until the expiration of the offer on December 31, 2016 unless withdrawn by a stockholder prior to such date. Any stockholder who has previously tendered shares may withdraw his/her shares at any time prior to the expiration of the offer (including any extension period) by submitting a Notice of Withdrawal to the Company. The withdrawal process is outlined in Amendment No.1 to the Company s Schedule TO filed with the SEC on July 26, 2016. 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company had repurchased an aggregate of   5.8   million shares of common stock for payments of $  55.8   million. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for payments of $27.6 million. Amounts include additional shares tendered for death and disability as permitted. 

Note 10   Net Increase in Net Assets 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. The Company had no potentially dilutive securities as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
    
  The following information sets forth the computation of the weighted average basic and diluted net increase (decrease) in net assets per share from operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015:

Note 11   Distributions 
    
  The Company s board of directors has authorized, and the Company has declared cash distributions payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on each day since it commenced operations. Since November 2013, the distribution rate has been $0.002378082 per day, which is equivalent to $0.868 per annum, per share of common stock. In March 2016, the Company s board of directors ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to $0.868 per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution amount to $0.002371585 per day per share of common stock, effective January 1, 2016, to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year.  
    
  The amount of each such distribution will be subject to the discretion of the board of directors and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. The Company will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates and accrue distributions on the date the Company accepts a subscription for shares of the Company s common stock. The distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. 
    
  From time to time, the Company may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of its board of directors. The Company may fund its cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to it, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets. The Company s distributions may exceed its earnings, especially during the period before the Company has substantially invested the proceeds from its IPO and Follow-on. As a result, a portion of the distributions the Company will make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued $  12.9   million in stockholder distributions that were unpaid. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued $13.2 million in stockholder distributions that were unpaid.

The following table reflects the stock distributions per share that the Company declared on its common stock to date:  

The Company has not established any limit on the extent to which it may use borrowings, if any, or proceeds from its IPO and Follow-on to fund distributions (which may reduce the amount of capital it ultimately invests in assets). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level. 

Note 12   Income Tax Information and Distributions to Stockholders 
    
    The Company has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Generally, a RIC is exempt from federal income taxes if it meets, certain quarterly asset diversification requirements, annual income tests, and distributes to stockholders its   Investment Company Taxable Income,   as defined in the Code, each taxable year. Distributions declared prior to the filing of the previous year's tax return and paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the

distributions paid in such tax year. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions to maintain its RIC status each year. The Company may also be subject to federal excise taxes of 4%.  
    
  A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its  investment company taxable income  (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If the Company's expenses in a given taxable year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), it would incur a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent taxable years and such net operating losses do not pass through to the RIC s stockholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, realized capital losses in excess of realized capital gains) to offset the RIC s investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset capital gains indefinitely. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, the Company may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that it is required to distribute and that is taxable to stockholders even if such taxable income is greater than the aggregate net income the Company actually earned during those taxable years. Such required distributions may be made from the Company cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. The Company may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event the Company realizes net capital gains from such transactions, the Company may receive a larger capital gain distribution than it would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
    
  The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740-10-25,   Income Taxes   ("ASC Topic 740"), nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits as of the periods presented herein. The Company's 2013, 2014 and 2015 federal tax years remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a deferred tax asset of $5.3 million and a deferred tax liability of $3.9 million. Given the losses generated by certain entities, deferred tax assets have been offset by valuation allowances of $5.3 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a deferred asset of $2.1 million and a deferred liability of $3.0 million. Given the losses generated by certain entities, deferred tax assets have been offset by valuation allowances of $2.1 million.  
    
  The deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been determined pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740, including the Company's estimation of future taxable income, if necessary, and is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.

Note 13   Financial Highlights 
    
  The following is a schedule of financial highlights for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015:  

______________ 
            (1)   
    The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Net investment income per share excluding the expense waiver and reimbursement equals $0.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
               (2)   
    The per share data for distributions reflects the actual amount of distributions declared per share during the period. 
               (3)   
    The issuance of common stock on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock mainly from the Company's dividend reinvestment program. 
               (4)   
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding the expense waiver and reimbursement, the ratio of net investment income and total expenses to average net assets is 7.75% and 5.37%, respectively. 
               (5)   
    Total return is calculated assuming a purchase of shares of common stock at the current net asset value on the first day and a sale at the current net asset value on the last day of the periods reported. Distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under the DRIP. The total return based on net asset value for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes the effect of the expense waiver and reimbursement which equaled 0.22%.  
               (6)   
    Portfolio turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of year-to-date purchases or sales over the average of the invested assets at fair value. Not annualized. 
               (7)   
    Ratios are annualized, except for incentive fees. 
               (8)   
    Offering costs are not included as an expense in the calculation of this ratio.

Note 15   Subsequent Events  
    
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Form   10-Q   and determined that there have been no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to the Company s disclosures in the consolidated financial statements except for the following:  
    
  DRIP Sales 
    
  From October 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016, the Company made distributions of $26.2 million. These distributions consisted of $15.8 million in cash and 1.2 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP. Total gross proceeds from the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP were $10.4 million.  
    
  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 
    
  On July 19, 2016, American Realty Capital II Advisors, LLC, the parent of the Adviser, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of Benefit Street, pursuant to which Benefit Street acquired all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of the Adviser (the  Transaction ). 
    
  In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a New Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, effective as of November 1, 2016, to allow the Adviser to serve as investment adviser to the Company following the closing of the Transaction, which occurred on November 1, 2016. The New Advisory Agreement was approved by the Company s stockholders at a special meeting on October 28, 2016. 
    
  The New Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 days  written notice. The New Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for an initial period of two years and thereafter will continue in effect from year to year if such continuance is approved at least annually by both (a) the vote of the Company s board of directors or the vote of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and (b) the vote of a majority of the board of directors who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act). All material terms of the New Advisory Agreement, which will have an initial term of two (2) years, are substantially similar in all material respects to the Existing Advisory Agreement. 
    
  A more detailed description of the terms of the New Advisory Agreement was previously reported on the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on September 16, 2016.  
    
    Pursuant to an administration agreement, ARC Advisory, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AR Global Investments, LLC, previously furnished the Company with, among other things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services (the  ARC Administration Agreement ). In addition, ARC Advisory assisted the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value and the filing of its tax returns. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company terminated the ARC Administration Agreement and entered into a new administration agreement with Benefit Street on November 1, 2016 (the  New Administration Agreement ). In connection with the New Administration Agreement, Benefit Street will provide the Company with office facilities and administrative services previously provided by ARC Advisory.  
    
  In connection with the closing of the Transaction on November 1, 2016, an affiliate of Benefit Street purchased $10.0 million of the Company s common stock based on the Company s net asset value per share in a private placement (the  Private Placement ) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
    
  On November 7, 2016, the Company issued approximately 1.2 million shares of the Company s common stock as a result of the Private Placement.

  Overview 
    
  We are a specialty finance company incorporated in Maryland in May 2010. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") and is applying the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 946, "  Financial Services - Investment Companies"   ("ASC 946").  
    
  Our investment objective is to generate both current income and to a lesser extent long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans and mezzanine debt issued by middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. We may also purchase interests in loans through secondary market transactions in the "over-the-counter" market for institutional loans. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated  
  
   59 

debt and equity in bankruptcy priority and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. We may invest in the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles ("Collateralized Securities"). Structurally, Collateralized Securities are entities that are formed to manage a portfolio of senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade or, in limited circumstances, unrated. The senior secured loans within these Collateralized Securities meet specified credit and diversity criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to create a diverse investment portfolio. We expect that each investment will generally range between approximately 0.5% to 3.0% of our total assets. In most cases, companies to whom we provide customized financing solutions will be privately held at the time we invest in them. 
       
  Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As our expected operating plans occur we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in addition to those discussed below. 
    
  Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates include: 
    
  Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
    
  Portfolio investments are reported on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value. On a quarterly basis the Adviser performs an analysis of each investment to assist the board of directors in its determination of fair value as follows: 
    
  Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined readily available, we use the quote obtained.  
    
  Investments without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Adviser may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process.  
    
  For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Adviser measures the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of  
  
   60 

the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of FASB ASC 946, as of our measurement date. The value of our total return swap agreement ("TRS") was primarily based on the increase or decrease in the value of the loans underlying the TRS, as determined by Citi based upon indicative pricing by an independent third-party pricing service.  
    
  For investments in Collateralized Securities, the Adviser models both the assets and liabilities of each Collateralized Securities' capital structure. The model uses a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate collateral cash flows from the assets, and distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on the priority of payments. The waterfall cash flows are discounted using rates that incorporate risk factors such as default risk, recovery risk, prepayment risk, reinvestment risk, and interest rate risk, among others. In addition, the Adviser considers broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services as an input to determining fair value when available. 
    
  With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:  

Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by the Adviser, potentially with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors;  

The independent valuation firm(s), if involved, will conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and 

Our board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of our Adviser, independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors.  
       
  Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
    
  Investment Advisory and Administration Agreements 
    
  Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement we have with the Adviser, we pay the Adviser a fee for its services consisting of two components - a management fee and an incentive fee. The management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our average gross assets and is payable quarterly in arrears.  
    
  The incentive fee consists of two parts.  The first part is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, we, pursuant to an affirmative vote of stockholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Advisory and Management Services Agreement (the  Existing Advisory Agreement ) between us and our investment adviser, BDCA Adviser, LLC (the  Adviser ). The Existing Advisory Agreement amends the manner in which the income incentive fee payable by us to the Adviser is earned and calculated. Specifically, under the Existing Advisory Agreement, the hurdle rate required for the Adviser to earn, and be paid, the income incentive fee is expressed as a percentage of our net assets rather than  Adjusted Capital  (as defined below), as it was previously calculated under the then-existing advisory and management services agreement (the  Prior Advisory Agreement ).  
       
  Under the Existing Advisory Agreement, the applicable percentages related to the incentive fee on income, including the hurdle rate, remain the same as those in the Prior Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, the incentive fee on income will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equal 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on our net assets, equal to 1.75% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.0%.  

61 

The Prior Advisory Agreement defined  Adjusted Capital  to mean the amount of money received from sales of our common stock (including reinvested dividends) minus distributions paid to stockholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
    
  The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Existing Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains, which  equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. Realized gains received from loans underlying the TRS we had with Citi were not included for purposes of evaluating the incentive fee on capital gains.  
    
  We have entered into the Amended and Restated Administration Servicing Agreement and the Amended and Restated Accounting Servicing Agreement with US Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the  Administrator ). The Administrator provides services, such as accounting, financial reporting and compliance support, necessary to operate. On August 13, 2012, we entered into a custody agreement with U.S. Bank National Association ( U.S. Bank ). Under the custody agreement, U.S. Bank holds all of our portfolio securities and cash for certain of our subsidiaries, and transfers such securities or cash pursuant to our instructions. The custody agreement is terminable by either party, without penalty, on not less than ninety days prior notice to the other party. Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of our IPO until May 2015, when we terminated our offering. RCS Capital Corporation ("RCAP"), the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with our Sponsor. In May 2016, RCAP and its affiliated debtors emerged from bankruptcy under the new name, Aretec Group, Inc.  
    
  On February 9, 2016, we and ARC Advisory Services, LLC ( ARC Advisory ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Sponsor, entered into an agreement pursuant to which ARC Advisory provides us with administrative services necessary for our operation  (the  ARC Administration Agreement ). Pursuant to the ARC Administration Agreement, ARC Advisory provides us with, among other things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. In addition, ARC Advisory assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value and the filing of our tax returns. We will reimburse ARC Advisory for the costs and expenses incurred by ARC Advisory in performing its obligations pursuant to the ARC Administration Agreement. 
    
  American Realty Capital II Advisors, LLC (the  Seller ), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of AR Global, our Sponsor, informed us that on July 19, 2016, the Seller entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with BSP Acquisition I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Purchaser ), a subsidiary of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. ( Benefit Street ). The Purchase Agreement provides, among other things, that the Seller would sell 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, to the Purchaser. 
    
  If the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the  Transaction ) is consummated, then it is expected to constitute an  assignment  (within the meaning of the 1940 Act) of the Existing Advisory Agreement. An assignment of the Existing Advisory Agreement would result in the termination of the Existing Advisory Agreement in accordance with its terms. A special committee comprised solely of our independent directors (the  Special Committee ) is responsible for the review and approval of the new investment advisory agreement with the Adviser (the "New Advisory Agreement") that would go into effect if the Transaction is completed, subject to approval by our stockholders as required by the 1940 Act (the  Stockholder Approval ). On August 12, 2016, our board of directors, including the members of the Special Committee, met in person and heard a further presentation from Benefit Street, discussed the Transaction and its possible effects on the Company, and evaluated the New Advisory Agreement. Senior officers of the Adviser and Benefit Street were present to answer questions from the board of directors. The board of directors, including all the members of the Special Committee, unanimously approved the New Advisory Agreement on August 12, 2016. See  Note 15 - Subsequent Events  for additional information regarding the closing of the Transaction, which occurred on November 1, 2016.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Generally, a RIC is exempt from federal income taxes if it distributes at least 90% of its   investment company taxable income,   as defined in the Code, each year. Distributions declared prior to the filing of the previous year's tax return and paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for  
  
   62 

determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to distribute sufficient distributions to maintain our RIC status each year. We may also be subject to federal excise taxes of 4%.   
    
  Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
    
  We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
    
    See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements.  
    
  Portfolio and Investment Activity  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we made $  376.2   million of investments in new and existing portfolio companies and had $  462.4   million in aggregate amount of exits and repayments, resulting in net repayments of $86.2 million for the period. The portfolio composition by loan market at fair value consisted of 77.1% Middle Market    (1)   , 3.8% Large Corporate    (2)   , and 19.1% Other    (3)    investments. In addition, the total portfolio of debt investments at fair value consisted of 93.0% bearing variable interest rates and 7.0% bearing fixed interest rates.  
  ______________ 
   (1)     Middle market represents companies whose annual revenues are between $10 million and $1 billion. 
   (2)     Large corporate represents companies whose annual revenues are in excess of $1 billion. 
   (3)     Other represents collateralized securities and equity investments. 
    
  Our portfolio composition, based on fair value at   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

______________ 
   (1)     Excludes the effect of the amortization or accretion of loan premiums or discounts.  
   (2)     Weighted average current yield for Collateralized Securities is based on the estimation of effective yield to expected maturity for each security as calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 325-40-35, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
    
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we made $1.2 billion of investments in new and existing portfolio companies and had $0.7 billion in aggregate amount of exits and repayments, resulting in net investments of $0.5 billion for the period. The portfolio composition by loan market consisted of 80.4% Middle Market    (1)   , 3.7% Large Corporate    (2)   , and 15.9% Other    (3)    investments. In addition, the total portfolio of debt investments consisted of 91.2% bearing variable interest rates and 8.8% bearing fixed interest rates.

  Portfolio Asset Quality 
    
  Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. 
                    Loan Rating 
      
    Summary Description 
      1 
       
    Debt investment exceeding fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since the time of investment are favorable. 

2 
       
    Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments are initially rated a  2 . 

3 
       
    Performing debt investment requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 

4 
       
    Underperforming debt investment. Some loss of interest or dividend expected, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 

5 
       
    Underperforming debt investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. 

The weighted average risk ratings of our investments based on fair value was 2.19 and 2.19 as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had six portfolio companies, which represented six portfolio investments, on non-accrual status. These investments had a total principal of $137.0 million and a total fair value of $56.6 million, which represented 5.4% and 2.6%, respectively, of our portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . We are currently evaluating potential value recovery alternatives for these investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had three portfolio companies, which represented three portfolio investments, on non-accrual status. These investments had a total principal of $51.9 million and a total fair value of $33.0 million, which represented 2.0% and 1.4%, respectively, of our portfolio as of December 31, 2015.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Operating results for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and September 30, 2015 was as follows: 

Investment Income  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , total investment income was $  62.2   million and $  176.7   million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to interest income from investments in portfolio companies with an average portfolio fair value of $2.3 billion and a weighted average current yield of 9.9%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, total investment income was $52.0 million and $157.5 million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to interest income from investments in portfolio companies with an average portfolio fair value of $2.1 billion and a weighted average current yield of 10.2%. 
    
  Operating Expenses  
    
  The composition of our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015 was as follows: 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred $  9.5   million and $  28.5   million, respectively, of management fees, of which the Adviser did not waive any such fees. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred $  7.9   million and $  14.8   million, respectively, of incentive fees, of which the Adviser did not waive any such fees. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $9.4 million and $26.5 million, respectively, of management fees, of which the Adviser did not waive any such fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred zero and $10.1 million, respectively, of incentive fees, of which the Adviser waived zero and $3.5 million, respectively. 
  
   65 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred interest and credit facility financing expenses of   $9.2   million and   $27.9   million, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred interest and credit facility financing expenses of   $7.6   million and   $17.4   million, respectively.  Interest and credit facility financing expenses are comprised of interest expense, non-usage fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of discount if applicable related to the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, Citi Credit Facility, UBS Credit Facility and Unsecured Notes. The increase in interest and credit facility financing expenses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in 2015 is a result of an increase in the weighted average interest rate as well as an increase in the average debt outstanding.   
       
  We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with our Adviser, whereby the Adviser may pay up to 100% of all of our operating expenses ( Expense Support Payment ) for any period beginning November 4, 2011, the date our prior registration statement on Form N-2 was declared effective and continuing until we and the Adviser mutually agree otherwise. The Expense Support Payments for any month shall be paid to us by the Adviser in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offsets against amounts due from us to the Adviser. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, no Expense Support Payments were made by our Adviser.  
    
  Net Realized Gain and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments (dollars in thousands): 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investments, net of deferred taxes, resulted in a net loss of   $(38.3)   million and   $(44.3)   million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a net realized and unrealized loss of   $(50.8)   million and   $(83.7)   million, respectively for the same periods in 2015. We look at net realized gains and change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) together, as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. 
    
  The net realized and unrealized loss for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by the unrealized depreciation on our Senior Secured First Lien Debt and Common Equity investments. The net realized and unrealized loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by the unrealized depreciation of $(24.0) million and $(56.8) million, respectively, across the portfolio of Collateralized Securities investments. In total, we sold or repaid $  462.4   million and $  578.0   million, respectively, of assets during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015.  
           
  Changes in Net Assets from Operations  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations of $  (6.7)   million and $  48.5   million, respectively, versus a net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from  
  
   66 

operations of $(19.3) million and $12.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the decrease is primarily attributable to a net increase in unrealized depreciation in our investments, driven mostly by our Senior Secured First Lien Debt and Common Equity Investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the increase is primarily attributable to a net increase in unrealized appreciation in our investments, driven mostly by our Collateralized Securities. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $  (0.04)   and $  0.27  , respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus a net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations of $(0.11) and $0.08, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Cash Flows  
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was $  157.7   million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to $  462.4   million in sales and repayments of investments, a net increase in unrealized depreciation of $  48.4   million, a net increase in net assets of   $48.5   million and an increase in unsettled purchases of   $3.2   million, offset by cash used in operating activities for purchases of $  376.2   million, an increase in unsettled sale proceeds of $  15.1   million and payment-in-kind interest of $  10.9   million.  
    
  Net cash used in financing activities of $  91.4   million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily related to net proceeds from the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, Citi Credit Facility and the UBS Credit Facility of $12.9 million. These inflows were partially offset by payments of stockholder distributions of $  73.9   million and repurchases of common stock of $  28.2   million.  
       
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $210.3 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions and sales of portfolio investments, among other factors. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to $917.0 million for purchases of investments partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $578.0 million for sales and repayments of investments. The purchase and sales activity was driven by the increase in investment activity resulting from the equity capital raising and borrowings on our credit facilities. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities of $316.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $165.6 million, net proceeds from the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, Citi Credit Facility and UBS Credit Facility of $357.8 million, and net proceeds from the Unsecured Notes of $98.4 million. These inflows were partially offset by principal repayments on debt of $232.8 million and payments of stockholder distributions of $57.0 million. 
    
  Recent Developments 
     DRIP Sales 
    
  From October 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016, we made distributions of $26.2 million. These distributions consisted of $15.8 million in cash and 1.2 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP. Total gross proceeds from the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP were $10.4 million.  
    
  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 
    
  On July 19, 2016, American Realty Capital II Advisors, LLC, the parent of the Adviser, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of Benefit Street, pursuant to which Benefit Street acquired all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of the Adviser (the  Transaction ). 
    
  In connection with the Transaction, we entered into a New Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, effective as of November 1, 2016, to allow the Adviser to serve as investment adviser to us following the closing of the Transaction, which occurred on November 1, 2016. The New Advisory Agreement was approved by our stockholders at a special meeting on October 28, 2016. 
    
  The New Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 days  written notice. The New Advisory Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for an initial period of two years and thereafter will continue in effect from year to  
  
   67 

year if such continuance is approved at least annually by both (a) the vote of our board of directors or the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and (b) the vote of a majority of the board of directors who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act). All material terms of the New Advisory Agreement, which will have an initial term of two (2) years, are substantially similar in all material respects to the Existing Advisory Agreement. 
    
  A more detailed description of the terms of the New Advisory Agreement was previously reported on our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on September 16, 2016.  
    
    Pursuant to an administration agreement, ARC Advisory, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AR Global Investments, LLC, previously furnished us with, among other things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services (the  ARC Administration Agreement ). In addition, ARC Advisory assisted us in determining and publishing its net asset value and the filing of its tax returns. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, we terminated the ARC Administration Agreement and entered into a new administration agreement with Benefit Street on November 1, 2016 (the  New Administration Agreement ). In connection with the New Administration Agreement, Benefit Street will provide us with office facilities and administrative services previously provided by ARC Advisory.  
    
  In connection with the closing of the Transaction on November 1, 2016, an affiliate of Benefit Street purchased $10.0 million of our common stock based on our net asset value per share in a private placement (the  Private Placement ) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
    
  On November 7, 2016, we issued approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock as a result of the Private Placement.  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We generate cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as proceeds from sales of our investments and, previously, from the net proceeds of our continuous public offering. The Registration Statement offering for sale up to $1.5 billion of shares of our common stock (150.0 million shares at an initial offering price of $10.00 per share) (the "Offering"), was declared effective on January 27, 2011. On July 1, 2014, our registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-193241) for our follow-on offering (the "Follow-on") was declared effective by the SEC. Simultaneously with the effectiveness of the Follow-on, our IPO terminated. Under the Follow-on, we can offer up to 101,100,000 shares of its common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued   180.9 million   shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $  2.0   billion including shares issued to the Sponsor and shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP"). 
    
  Our principal demands for funds in both the short-term and long-term are for portfolio investments, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our investors, repurchases under our share repurchase program, and for the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. We may also from time to time enter into other agreements with third parties whereby third parties will contribute to specific investment opportunities. Items other than investment acquisitions are expected to be met from a combination of the proceeds from the sale of common stock, cash flows from operations, and, during our IPO and Follow-on, reimbursements from the Adviser. We closed the Offering to new investments on April 30, 2015. In order to allow for associated processing time needed, our transfer agent accepted subscriptions in good order dated on or before April 30, 2015 and received no later than June 30, 2015. 
    
  We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with our Adviser, whereby the Adviser may pay the Expense Support Payment for any period beginning on the effective date of the Registration Statement, until we and the Adviser mutually agree otherwise. The purpose of the Expense Support Agreement was to reduce our offering and operating expenses to ensure that we were able to bear a reasonable level of expense in relation to our investment income. The Expense Support Payment for any month shall be paid to us by the Adviser in cash and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser. Operating expenses subject to this agreement include expenses as defined by U.S. GAAP, including, without limitation, advisory fees payable and interest on indebtedness for such period, if any. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Adviser had made cumulative payments to us for $1.0 million of expenses pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement and none of the cumulative total is eligible for reimbursement. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Adviser made no payments to us for expenses pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement. See Note 4 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - Expense Support Agreement - in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on this arrangement, including Expense Payments made by our Adviser pursuant to the terms of this agreement and the ability of the Adviser to be reimbursed for Expense Payments made to us. 
    
  Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from private offerings, proceeds from the sale of investments and undistributed funds from operations.  
  
   68 

However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to raise proceeds in our public offering will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for BDCs. 
    
  We intend to conduct semi-annual tender offers pursuant to our share repurchase program. Our board of directors will consider the following factors, among others, in making its determination regarding whether to cause us to offer to repurchase shares and under what terms: 

the effect of such repurchases on our qualification as a RIC (including the consequences of any necessary asset      sales); 
                
    the liquidity of our assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of assets); 
                
    our investment plans and working capital requirements; 
                
    the relative economies of scale with respect to our size; 
                
    our history in repurchasing shares or portions thereof; and 
                
    the condition of the securities markets. 
       
  On March 8, 2016, our board of directors amended our share repurchase program. We will begin to make tender offers on a semi-annual basis, instead of on a quarterly basis as was done previously. We will continue to limit the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 5.0% at each semi-annual tender offer. In addition, in the event of a stockholder s death or disability, any repurchases of shares made in connection with a stockholder s death or disability may be included within the overall limitation imposed on tender offers during the relevant redemption period, which provides that we may limit the number of shares to be repurchased during any redemption period to the number of shares of common stock we are able to repurchase with the proceeds received from the sale of shares of common stock under the DRIP during such redemption period. 
    
  In light of the announced proposed strategic sale of the Adviser to a subsidiary of Benefit Street, we announced on July 26, 2016 that it had amended and extended its previously announced tender offer to acquire up to 8,610,409 shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to $8.86 per share, which represented our net asset value per share at March 31, 2016. The tender offer was due to expire at 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on July 27, 2016. Our board of directors approved amending the tender offer to: (i) increase the offer to purchase from up to 8,610,409 to up to 17,220,818, which represents 10.0% of the weighted average number of our shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, at a price equal to our net asset value per share as of September 30, 2016; and (ii) extend the duration of the tender offer to December 31, 2016. In addition, our board of directors amended our share repurchase program, solely with respect to 2016, to permit an annual tender offer, instead of two semi-annual tender offers. All other provisions of the share repurchase program will continue to apply, including limiting the number of shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, and limiting funding for repurchases in any redemption period to proceeds received during that same period through the sale of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. 
    
  Our board of directors approved the amendments and extension of the tender offer and the amendment to the share repurchase program in light of the announced proposed strategic sale of BDCA Adviser to Benefit Street and the required approval of both a special committee, which is comprised of the independent directors of our board of directors, and our stockholders. None of the shares of our common stock previously tendered under the original tender offer were purchased and, as a result of the amendment and extension of the tender offer, all of such shares will remain pending acceptance by us until the expiration of the offer on December 31, 2016 unless withdrawn by a stockholder prior to such date. Any stockholder who has previously tendered shares may withdraw his/her shares at any time prior to the expiration of the offer (including any extension period) by submitting a Notice of Withdrawal to us. The withdrawal process is outlined in Amendment No.1 to our Schedule TO filed with the SEC on July 26, 2016. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  Our board of directors has authorized, and we have declared, cash distributions payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on each day since we commenced operations. Since November 2013, the distribution rate has been $0.002378082 per day, which is equivalent to $0.868 per annum, per share of common stock. In March 2016, our board of directors ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to $0.868 per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution amount to $0.002371585 per day per share of common stock, effective January 1, 2016, to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year.  
    
  The amount of each such distribution will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the  
  
   69 

month using record and declaration dates and accrue distributions on the date we accept a subscription for shares of our common stock. The distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. 
    
  From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board of directors. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our IPO. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes.  
    
  The table below shows the components of the distributions we have declared and/or paid during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $  12.9   million of distributions accrued and unpaid. 

We may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us including expense payments from our Adviser that are subject to reimbursement to it as well as offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions. Prior to June 30, 2012, a substantial portion of our distributions resulted from Expense Support Payments made by our Adviser that are subject to reimbursement by us within three years from the date such payment obligations were incurred. The purpose of this arrangement could be to avoid such distributions being characterized as returns of capital for U.S. GAAP or tax purposes. Despite this, we may still have distributions which could be characterized as a return of capital for tax purposes  .   You should understand that any such distributions were not based on our investment performance and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or our Adviser continues to make such reimbursements. You should also understand that our future reimbursements of such Expense Support Payments will reduce the distributions that you would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain our distributions or that we will be able to pay distributions at all. The Adviser has no obligation to make Expense Support Payments in future periods. No Expense Support Payments were made by our Adviser during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The following table sets forth the distributions made during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (dollars in thousands):  

Election as a RIC 
    
  We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December, 31 2011, and intend to maintain our qualification as a RIC thereafter. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our  investment company taxable income,  which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, or the annual distribution requirement. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes. We may be subject to a 4% U.S federal excise tax.  
  
   70 

Inflation 
    
  The impact of inflation on our portfolio depends on the type of securities we hold. When inflation occurs, the value of our equity securities may fall in the short term.  However in the long term, a company s revenue and earnings and, therefore, the value of the equity investment, should at least increase at the same pace as inflation. The effect of inflation on debt securities is more immediate and direct as inflation may decrease the value of fixed rate debt securities. However, not all debt securities are affected equally, the longer the term of the debt security, the more volatile the value of the investment. The process through which we will value the investments in our portfolio on a quarterly basis, market quotations and our multi-step valuation process as described in our significant accounting policies, will take the effect of inflation into account.    
    
     Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
    
  We have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Adviser, whereby we pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Adviser or its affiliates in connection with asset and service fees, reimbursement of operating costs and offering related costs. See Note 4 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements - for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, 
   agreements and fees. 
    
  See Note 15 - Subsequent Events - for a discussion of our new administration agreement with Benefit Street. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt and other contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016  :  

______________ 
    
            (1)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $161.8 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
               (2)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $114.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Citi Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
               (3)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no unused borrowing capacity under the UBS Credit Facility. 
               (4)   
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no unused borrowing capacity under the Unsecured Notes. 

71 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  
    
  Commitments 
    
    In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into future funding commitments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unfunded commitments on delayed draw term loans of $29.5 million, unfunded commitments on revolver term loans of $21.5 million, unfunded incremental term loans of $1.6 million and unfunded equity capital commitments of $10.7 million. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had unfunded commitments on delayed draw term loans of $48.7 million, unfunded commitments on revolver term loans of $18.9 million and unfunded equity capital commitments of $11.8 million. The unfunded commitments are disclosed in our consolidated schedule of investments. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments.  

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. During the periods covered by this report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt included variable-rate debt, bearing a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.59% and fixed rate debt, bearing an interest rate of 6.00% with a total carrying value of $  855.4   million. The following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase by 100 or 200 basis points or decrease by 25 basis points assuming that our current statement of assets and liabilities was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. 

Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income may be dependent on the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of increasing interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

72 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were (a) designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed and reported in an accurate manner and on a timely basis and the information that we are required to disclose in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management to permit timely decisions with respect to required disclosure and (b) operating in an effective manner. 
    
  Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , neither we nor our Adviser are defendants in any material pending legal proceeding, and no such material proceedings are known to be contemplated. However, from time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under the contracts with our portfolio companies. Third parties may also seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I.,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as described below.  
    
  Our shares will not be listed on an exchange or quoted through a quotation system for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, you will have limited liquidity and may not receive a full return of your invested capital if you sell your shares.  
    
  Our shares are illiquid assets for which there is not expected to be any secondary market nor is it expected that any will develop in the future. We intend to explore a potential liquidity event for our stockholders between five and seven years following the completion of our offering stage, which may include further follow-on offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will complete a liquidity event within such time or at all. We expect that our board of directors, in the exercise of its duties to us, will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that then-current market conditions are favorable for a liquidity event, and that such an event is in our best interests. A liquidity event could include (1) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation, (2) a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange or (3) a merger or another transaction approved by our board in which our stockholders will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company.  
    
  In making the decision to apply for listing of our shares, our directors will try to determine whether listing our shares or liquidating our assets will result in greater value for our stockholders. In making a determination of what type of liquidity event is in our best interests, our board of directors, including our independent directors, may consider a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, market conditions, portfolio diversification, portfolio performance, our financial condition, potential access to capital as a listed company, market conditions for the sale of our assets or listing of our common stock, internal management requirements to become a perpetual life company and the potential for stockholder liquidity. If our shares are listed, we cannot assure you a public trading market will develop.  

73 

You should also be aware that shares of publicly traded closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their NAV. If our shares are eventually listed on a national exchange, we would not be able to predict whether our common stock would trade above, at or below NAV. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV may decline.

 EXHIBIT 31.1

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31.1 
    
  I, Richard J. Byrne, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   of Business Development Corporation of America; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a)

  I, Corinne D. Pankovcin, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   of Business Development Corporation of America; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
