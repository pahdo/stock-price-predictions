Note 1. Basis of Presentation 

Peregrine Industries, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on October 1, 1995 for
the purpose of manufacturing residential pool heaters. The Company was formerly located in
Deerfield Beach, Florida. Products were primarily sold throughout the United States,
Canada, and Brazil. In June 2002, the Registrant and its subsidiaries filed a petition for
bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. At present,
the Company has no business operations and is deemed to be a shell company.
	The Company had a change in control on July 8, 2013 as a result of the
	sale by our former principal shareholders, Richard Rubin, Thomas J. Craft,
	Jr. and Ivo Heiden, of their 324,000 shares of common stock, representing
	approximately 61.8% of the Company's outstanding common stock, to Dolomite
	Industries Ltd ("Dolomite"). In connection with the private sale of their
shares of common stock to Dolomite on July 2, 2013, Messrs. Rubin and Heiden agreed to waive
a total of $224,196 in liabilities owed to them at
	June 30, 2013. In connection with the change of control transaction, two
	former principal shareholders transferred and assigned all $195,000 of their
	two convertible notes to three unaffiliated third parties and one affiliated
party. See note 3. On
	July 22, 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Yair Fudim, Dolomite's
	Chairman, as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and CEO of the
	Company and appointed Ofer Naveh, Dolomite's CFO, as CFO of the Company.
	On the same date, Richard Rubin resigned as CEO and CFO of the Company.     
	 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim
	financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal
	recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of financial position,
	results of operations, and cash flows. The information included in this
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the
	financial statements and the accompanying notes included in our Annual
	Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The accounting
	policies are described in the "Notes to the Financial Statements" in the
	2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this Form
	10-Q. The year-end balance sheet data presented for comparative purposes was
	derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all
	disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America (US GAAP). The results of operations for the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
	operating results for the full year or for any other subsequent interim
	period. 
	  Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates:   
	 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. 

  Cash and Cash Equivalents:   
	 For financial statement presentation purposes, the
Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. 

  Stock Based Compensation:   
	 Stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for using the fair
	value method in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 505-50, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. All transactions in
which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the
fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The
measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the
earlier of the date on which the third-party performance is complete or the date on which
it is probable that performance will occur. 

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:   
	 ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
instruments. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market
assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016.
These financial instruments include accounts payable and accrued expenses. Fair values
were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are
short-term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values. 

  Earnings per Common Share:   
	 Basic net loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss
per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist
of options to purchase common stock (only if those options are exercisable and at prices
below the average share price for the period) and shares issuable upon the conversion of
issued and outstanding preferred stock. Due to the net losses reported, dilutive common
equivalent shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, as
inclusion would be anti-dilutive for the periods presented. There were no common
equivalent shares required to be added to the basic weighted average shares outstanding to
arrive at diluted weighted average shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

  Income Taxes:   
	 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires recognition of estimated income taxes
payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current year and for the estimated
future tax effect attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards. Measurement of
deferred income tax is based on enacted tax laws including tax rates, with the measurement
of deferred income tax assets being reduced by available tax benefits not expected to be
realized.  

 ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This guidance
prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized.
First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be
sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of
the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. There are no uncertain tax
positions taken by the Company on its tax returns. Tax years subsequent to 2003 remain
open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.  

 Management of the Company is not aware of any additional needed liability for
unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The Company has net operating
losses of approximately $566,026, which begin to
expire in 2027. 

  Impact of recently issued accounting standards:   
	 In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ), an amendment to FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements.
This update provides guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a
going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU 2014-15 is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and
interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company provides
the disclosures required by ASU 2014-15. 

Note 2. Going Concern  
	 The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
	basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of
	liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the
	foreseeable future. Since adopting  fresh-start  accounting as of September
	5, 2002, the Company has accumulated losses aggregating to $566,026 and has
	insufficient working capital to meet operating needs for the next twelve
	months as of September 30, 2016, all of which raise substantial doubt about the
	Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Note 3. Convertible Notes - Shareholders   

 In April 2010, we issued two convertible promissory notes in the amount of $97,500 to
two shareholders, bearing interest at 12% per annum until paid or converted. Interest is
payable upon the maturity date at December 31, 2013. The initial conversion rate of the
notes had been $0.10 per share. The notes formalized a like amount due through the
accretion of cash advances and the fair value of services provided without cost covering
several years. In connection with the change of control transaction, two former principal
shareholders transferred and assigned all $195,000 of their two convertible notes to three
unaffiliated third parties, of which $159,500 of these convertible notes were subsequently
transferred to Dolomite, two convertible notes each in the amount of $8,500 were
transferred to two unaffiliated parties and one convertible note in the amount of $18,500
was transferred to a third unaffiliated party. On July 11, 2013, the annual interest rate for
the
$195,000 of convertible notes was adjusted from 12% to 1%. Interest is payable upon
the maturity date of the convertible notes at July 1, 2017. The conversion rate of all convertible notes is $0.05
per share.

In November 2015, Dolomite purchased the three unaffiliated party notes with
principal amount of $35,500 including accrued interest at principal value.

As of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, we have four convertible promissory notes
outstanding totaling $195,000, bearing interest at the rate of 1% per annum until paid or converted.  

 On September 12, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement with Dolomite under which we
receive funding for general operating expenses from time-to-time as needed by the Company.
The Dolomite Loan bears interest of 1% per annum and shall be due and payable on a
date 366 days from the date of the loan.
As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on this loan was $128,206,
included in advance under Loan Agreement with related party, of which $87,268 of
this amount is past due according to the Loan Agreement. The accrued interest on this loan as of September 30, 2016 was $1,877. 

 In accordance with ASC # 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, we evaluated the note holder s non-detachable conversion right provision
and liquidated damages clause, contained in the terms governing the Note to determine
whether the features qualify as an embedded derivative instruments at issuance. Such
non-detachable conversion right provision and liquidated damages clause did not need to be
accounted as derivative financial instruments. Additionally, since the conversion price
was below the current stock price a further evaluation needed to be performed for the
existence of a beneficial conversion feature. 

 In April 2010, when the convertible notes were originally issued the price of our stock
was $3.99, such price would have created a beneficial conversion feature but as the
Company is and has been so thinly traded during the last 3 years, the fair value of the
stock price was deemed not to be a fair value the conversion feature. Management decided
that because the Company s ability to continue as a going concern was in question and
that it has no revenue sources that the conversion price was a better measure of fair
market value. Based on that decision, no beneficial conversion feature was reflected in
the financial statements.

Amounts due to related party consists of amounts

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION   
 Back to Table of Contents    

  Some of the statements contained in this quarterly
report of Peregrine Industries, Inc. (hereinafter the  Company ,  We 
or the  Registrant ) discuss future expectations, contain projections of our
plan of operation or financial condition or state other forward-looking information.
Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.
You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. They use of words such as  anticipate, 
 estimate,   expect,   project,   intend, 
 plan,   believe,  and other words and terms of similar meaning in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to
time, we also may provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the
public.  

   Recent Developments   

On September 12, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement with Dolomite, our
	controlling shareholder, under
	which we receive funding for general operating expenses from time-to-time as
	needed by the Company. The  loan bears an interest rate at 1% per
	annum. As of
	September 30, 2016, the Company had received $ 128,206 
under this loan agreement.  

In November 2015, Dolomite purchased the three unaffiliated party notes at
	principal value of $35,500. As of September 30, 2016, we have four convertible promissory
	notes outstanding all held by our control shareholder Dolomite totaling $195,000, bearing interest at the rate of 1% per annum until paid or converted.  
	 On October 26, 2015, GreenStone Industries Ltd., our controlling
	shareholder changed its name to Dolomite Holdings Ltd. 

Overview   

Our activities are related to seeking a new business
	opportunities. We used our limited personnel and financial resources in
	connection with such activities. It may be expected that in connection with
	the control acquisition by Dolomite, our activities in pursuing a new
	business opportunity will accelerate and will involve, among other things,
	the issuance of restricted shares of common stock.  
	  Results of Operations during the three-month period
	ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three-month period ended
	September 30,
	2015  
	 We have not generated any revenues during the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We had operating expenses related to
	general and administrative expenses, being a public company and interest
	expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net
	loss of $11,393 due to general and administrative expenses of $10,590 and
	interest expenses of $803 compared to a net loss during the three months
	ended September 30, 2015 of $11,079 due to general and administrative expenses of
	$10,426 and interest expenses of $653. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

On
September 30, 2016, we had no cash or other assets and
had current liabilities of $408,142 consisting of $3,084 in accounts payable, $81,852 in accrued interest,
$128,206  
in advances from Dolomite and $195,000 i  n four convertible notes held
by Dolomite, our controlling shareholder.  

As of June 30, 2016, we

had current liabilities of $396,749 consisting of $1,465 in accounts payable, $81,049 in accrued interest,
$119  ,235
in advances from Dolomite $195,000 i  n four convertible notes held
by our controlling shareholder.     

We had a negative cash flow from operations of
	$8,971 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to a net loss of $11,393
	offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest of $2,422. We financed our negative cash flow from operations during the
	three-month period ended September 30, 2016 through
	advances made by our controlling shareholder of $8,971.  

We financed our negative cash flows from operations of
	$10,426 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was due to a net
	loss of $11,079 offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $653
	through related party borrowings in the same amount.  
	 The Company currently plans to satisfy its cash
	requirements for the next 12 months through
	borrowings from its controlling shareholder and believes it can satisfy its cash requirements so
	long as it is able to obtain financing from its controlling shareholders. The
	Company expects that money borrowed will be used during the next 12 months
	to satisfy the Company's operating costs, professional fees and for general
	corporate purposes.  

Additional financing necessary for the Company to
	continue as a going concern is expected to be provided by Dolomite until
	such time we complete a business combination and commence
	business operations that generate cash flow. Our independent auditors have
	issued an opinion for the year ended June 30, 2016 with an explanatory
	paragraph based on going concern.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

As of
	September 30, 2016, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial
	officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness of the Company's
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or
	15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  
	 
	Based upon the evaluation of these controls and procedures as provided under
	the  Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
	Framework (2013) , our chief executive officer and chief financial
	officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
	ineffective as September 30, 2016. Management has identified corrective
	actions for the weakness and will consider the need to add personnel and
	implement improved review procedures during fiscal year 2017.   
	  Changes
		in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
	 There were no changes in
		the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
		period covered by this report, which were identified in connection with
		management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and
		15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are
		reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control
		over financial reporting.
